<a id="title57"></a><h1 class="title-chapter"><span class="b">CARD TRICKS</span></h1>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Explanatory.</span> It is not our purpose to describe the various kinds of apparatus, or prepared or mechanical cards, that play so great a part in the professional conjurer’s startling exhibitions. The enumeration alone of these devices would fill a volume twice this size; and anyway they would be of little service to the amateur for impromptu entertainment. But we shall describe some tricks that may be performed with an ordinary deck, under any circumstances, providing the necessary skill has been acquired to execute the sleights. However, the artist who has attained some degree of proficiency in manipulation as taught by this work, may by taxing his wits a little, devise no end of tricks for himself, with the advantage that they will not be “shop worn” articles.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The simplest sleight, if well rigged up with either plausible or nonsensical clap-trap, may be made to provide a most astonishing and elaborate card trick; whereas, if the sleight be exhibited alone, the effect is not at all commensurate with the time and labor spent in acquiring the skill. Conceal, as far as possible, the possession of digital ability, and leave the company still guessing how it is done.</p>
<p class="p-indent">For some of the following tricks we have invented names and garnished them up with a rigmarole merely to show the part that “patter” plays in card entertainments. Our readers essaying the tricks should compose their own monologue, so that it may be in keeping with their particular personality or style of address.</p>
<p class="p-indent"><span class="i">The Exclusive Coterie.</span> — In Effect: The four Queens are selected and laid face down in a row on the table. Three indifferent cards are placed on each Queen. Now the company selects one of the four packets, and it is found to consist of the four Queens only.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Sleights: Palm and Shift.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Patter and Execution. — “Ladies and gentlemen, I shall endeavor to illustrate, with the aid of this ordinary deck of cards, how futile are the efforts of plebeians to break into that select circle of society known as the Beau-monde, and especially how such entree is prevented by the polite but frigid exclusiveness of its gentler members.</p>
<p class="p-indent">“We shall assume that it is the occasion of a public reception, our table the hall, our deck the common herd, and we may fittingly select the four Queens as representing the feminine portion of the Smart Set.” (Lay four Queens face down on table.) “Will some one now kindly see that there are no more Queens in the deck.” (Hand deck for inspection.) “There are no more Queens in the deck? Thanks!” (Take deck back.) “But are we all quite sure that the cards on the table are the four Queens? Please examine them.” (Hand them to one of the company, and now secretly palm three cards in right hand.) “They are the four Queens? Kindly place them on the deck.” (Extend deck in left hand and when Queens are placed on top secretly place palmed cards on top of them.) “Now, as our table is supposed to be the scene of this grand function, we shall station those four particularly exclusive ladies at different points in the room” (lay out the first three top cards face down), “giving her majesty the Queen of — — ” (hesitate and carelessly turn Queen face up apparently to see the suit, and allow the company to see it also, then name the suit), “the post of honor near the entrance.” (Lay first Queen on the table and make a shift, holding location of other three Queens.) “Now, as would naturally be the case, we shall besiege these high strung patrician ladies with attentions from the lower orders, which the rest of the deck represents, by first surrounding her majesty on the right with three cards from the top” (lay three cards on first table card), “and to show no partiality we shall cut the deck haphazard, and plague our second liege lady with three of the first presumptuous plebeians we may find there” (cut off small packet and place three cards on second table card), “and though the proximity or even notice of any of these common persons are equally abhorrent to our grand dames we shall treat them all alike by again cutting and surrounding her majesty at the entrance with three more rank outsiders” (this time cut to location of shift, and place the three Queens on table Queen), “and permit three more from the bottom who have been least crowding and therefore more deserving to proffer their homage to the other fair one.” (Lay three bottom cards on the other table card.)</p>
<p class="p-indent">“Now, ladies and gentlemen, as you have seen, I have brutally taken advantage of these unprotected and tenderly nurtured creatures by placing them in circumstances that must be extremely galling to their aristocratic sensibilities. Will they endure such conditions? Having some knowledge of the marvelous subtlety, finesse and resources of the sex, I feel confident they can, with tact and discretion, easily elude their persecutors, and form a more congenial coterie among themselves. Will some one please select two of these packets?” (Whichever packets are selected place those two that do not contain the Queens at the back of the table side by side.) “Thanks. Now kindly tell me which of the two remaining packets I shall take?” (In any case pick up the two packets, placing the Queens at the front of the table and the second packet back beside the others. The question is purposely ambiguous.)</p>
<p class="p-indent">“Now we must see whether I were over-confident in predicting that the Queens would seek each other’s society. If they are all found in one packet I was right. In which packet would they be most likely to congregate? As the front packet was your selection, and as it is given the most prominent position, I think the fatal vanity of the sex would tempt them to be there. We shall see.” (Turn up four Queens, then face the other three packets, showing no Queens among them.)</p>
<p class="p-indent">It will have been seen by the foregoing that the presentation of a card trick may contain much more bosh than action, and indeed the performance of the one just described might be advantageously prolonged by a great deal more nonsense. In all card entertainments the more palaver the more the interest is excited, and the address and patter of the performer will count as much if not more than his skill in manipulation.</p>
<p class="p-indent"><span class="i">The Divining Rod.</span> — In Effect: A card is freely selected by the company and replaced in the pack, which is thoroughly shuffled. The performer is now blindfolded, shuffles the cards in this condition, then spreads them face down over the table, poises a pen-knife over the mass, and suddenly pierces the selected card through with the open blade.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Sleights: Shift, Palm and Blind Shuffle.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Execution and Patter. — “Ladies and gentlemen. It is a fact well known to archaeologists that many very wonderful arts which were possessed by the ancients have, through the course of ages, been completely lost to modern civilization. Prominent among these superior accomplishments was the mysterious power of divining the presence of water or metals that lay hidden far under the ground. Now it may be that the assertion I am about to make will be received by you with polite but none the less absolute incredulity; but it has been my very great good fortune to discover, by the merest accident, the underlying principle of this lost art, and I have mapped out a plan of experiment and study that will in time, I trust, enable me to give once more to the world complete and scientific data for positively ascertaining the immediate whereabouts of such metals as gold, silver or copper by a process as simple as the waving of a willow wand over the prospected area.</p>
<p class="p-indent">“I do not myself as yet fully understand the exact nature of the power I have stumbled upon, but I know it to be a sort of magnetic or sympathetic attraction, and I shall illustrate to you the principle involved by experimenting with a deck of cards. Will some one please make a selection of one card? Thank you. Now I wish you to remember the name. Put it back anywhere in the deck.” (Shift and palm off card.) “Would you like to shuffle? Mix them up thoroughly.” (Take back deck, placing palmed card on top and show large handkerchief.) “Now, ladies and gentlemen, although no ordinary power on earth can find that selected card, I am going to satisfy all present that it is a very extraordinary power indeed that will assist me in producing it. As a matter of fact, the power is entirely apart from any personal ability I may possess; the merit of the feat will be solely due to the mysterious properties of this little pen-knife. To conclusively prove that I take no part in the action I shall have some one blindfold me with this handkerchief.” (Fold the handkerchief, and when it is being knotted at back adjust fold over eyes and nose so that table can be seen when looking straight downward.) “Now, as it is utterly impossible for me to see at all, I shall again shuffle the cards” (blind shuffle and leave one extra card on top), “and spread them out over the table.” (Spread the deck on the table with a rotary motion, gradually working off top card and retaining second card with finger or thumb, employing both hands so that selected card can be almost wholly covered. Keep exposed corner in sight and spread balance of cards still further over table. Now take open pen-knife in hand.) “Please observe that I do not touch the cards at all.” (Poise knife daintily between finger and thumb, circle about with hovering motion, and suddenly pierce card through its exposed part. Remove handkerchief, request name of card and slowly turn it up on point of blade.)</p>
<p class="p-indent">We consider this trick a capital one if performed with some address. Of course the patter is all a matter of taste and any invention may answer. The possibility of getting a perfect view of the table when the eyes are bandaged is never suspected by the uninitiated, but it is a fact well known to conjurers. The slightest glint is quite sufficient, as the head may be moved about freely so as to take in the whole plane below. Under any circumstances it is difficult to fold a handkerchief so that no ray of light will enter from beneath.</p>
<p class="p-indent">This trick may be performed without getting sight of the card, by retaining the selected card under finger of one hand and then the other, and when spreading is complete retaining its position well exposed, and piercing by mechanical judgment of its location.</p>
<p class="p-indent"><span class="i">The Invisible Flight.</span> — In Effect: A card is selected by the company. The performer places it on the table to the right. Another card is selected and performer places it on table to the left. The first drawn card is now placed on top of the deck, which was lying on the table, and the two selected cards are commanded to change places and found to have done so.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Sleights: Top Change and Palm Change.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Execution: Stand behind the table facing the company. Have a card selected by a spectator to the right, hold deck in left hand, take back drawn card in right hand, show it first to the company on the right, then to company on the left, then exchange it for top card of deck when making half turn again to the right and deposit card with same movement on the table at the right side. Now have the second card selected by some spectator to the left, palm the top card in right hand when closing the deck, and hold deck in right hand by ends, face down. Take back second drawn card in left hand, showing it to company on left. Now drop deck on middle of table, and take second selected card from the left hand into the right, seizing it by the ends, and depositing palmed card on top of it. Hold closely together and show as one card to company on the right. The right hand now contains the two selected cards. Make “Palm Change,” taking first selected card in left hand, and deposit it on left side of table. Immediately pick up card on right side of table by ends, with the right hand, and drop it openly from several inches above, on top of deck. Pick up deck by drawing it with sliding movement to edge of table, depositing palmed card on top, and place the pack on the table to the right. As the exchange is now made finish the trick as desired.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The first exchange is made by employing the “Top Change,” and the tacit excuse for bringing the hands together for the instant is obtained by showing the card first to the company on the right, then to the left, and then depositing the card on right side of table. The second exchange is made very slowly, or at least in the usual time required to pass a card from one hand to the other. The entire company should be permitted to see the card about to be palmed; then the hand is naturally turned down as the left fingers apparently carry away to the left the card just shown. When the table card is dropped on the deck, it may be permitted to fall unevenly, giving one reason for picking up the deck, i. e., to square up. Transferring the deck from the middle of the table to the right side is the second tacit excuse.</p>
<p class="p-indent">This trick is usually performed by having one duplicate card, and forcing it, in which case the assistance of the deck for the third exchange is not required. But as we confine our list to those that may be performed with an ordinary deck, the foregoing method will be found satisfactory.</p>
<div class="section1"><a id="title58"></a><h1 class="title-section1" id="toc_1"><span class="b">TRICKS WITH THE PREARRANGED DECK</span></h1>
<p class="p">The usual plan is to arrange the whole pack in the order suggested by the following jingle, viz.:
</p>
<div class="blocktext"><p class="p-br-blocktext">“Eight Kings threatened to save <br/>Ninety-five Queens from one sick Knave.”</p></div><p class="p">
Thus indicating the order of the thirteen values, as Eight, King, Three, Ten, Two, Seven, Nine, Five, Queen, Four, Ace, Six, Jack. The suits are taken in a regular order, say, Diamonds, Clubs, Hearts, Spades. To arrange the deck, lay the Eight of Diamonds face up on the table, then place the King of Clubs face up on that, then the Three of Hearts on that, then Ten of Spades, Two of Diamonds, Seven of Clubs, Nine of Hearts, Five of Spades, Queen of Diamonds, and so on, continuing until the fifty-two cards are laid out, the last card being the Jack of Spades.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Any arrangement is as good as another so long as the values do not run in their regular order, i. e., One, Two, Three, Four, Five, etc., and though the above arrangement is well known, it does not matter in the least when performing. Only those who are well versed in card tricks would recognize the order, and such persons cannot be deceived with any kind of arrangement. The tax on the memory is very slight, there being but thirteen names to commit, and conning them over for half an hour or so should impress their order on the mind permanently. The deck so arranged makes every thirteenth card the same value, and of the next suit in the order of suits; every fourth card the same suit, and every second card the other suit of the same color.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Cutting does not disturb the order and the top card is always next in the regular order to the bottom, and the performer, secretly noting the bottom card, has the key to the situation. We shall describe several very startling effects that may be caused by the employment of the prearranged deck in the hands of a really clever operator.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Of course, the prearrangement must be carefully concealed. The performer first blind shuffles, then requests some spectator to cut. Then spreading the cards fanwise with both hands, requests the spectator to select any number of the cards, and permits him to do so but from only one position in the fan, withdrawing the deck immediately as the cards are drawn, so as to prevent any attempt to select from different positions. The performer now separates his hands and the deck, at the point where the cards were drawn, and the right hand carelessly places the cards which were above those drawn, under the left-hand portion. He now secretly notes the bottom card, barely sighting the index at the base of the left thumb, then raises the inner corner of the top card slightly with the left thumb, getting a glimpse of its index. There is little or no fear of the action being noticed, as the company is not yet informed of the nature of the trick, and the principal attention is taken by the cards selected. The performer may now finish the trick in any manner. He has learned the number of cards drawn, and what cards they are, by naming over mentally in the prearranged order, beginning from the bottom card that he has noted, the cards that should be between it and the top card, which he has also noted. He may first pretend to determine the number drawn by weighing those that are left, and then take back the selected cards one at a time, boldly proclaiming that though the difference in the weight of each card is infinitely little, still there is a difference; and delicately ascertaining its suit and value by this means as he holds it poised in the right hand. Or he may assume the power of mind-reading, determining first the color then the suit, then the value of each card. Or he may terminate the trick by simply naming the cards in their order. There are a hundred and one variations, and in carrying them out the performer must see that the arranged order is not disturbed, so that he may continue his experiments with the deck. There is no reason that he should not look at the cards when they are returned, but they are rarely changed from the order drawn.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The performer may now request the company to call for any particular card, and he can locate it almost instantly from his knowledge of the bottom card, and he makes the two-handed shift, bringing it into view. He may hold the deck face up in the left hand, and slightly spring the outer corners under cover of the right hand, glancing at the index; or hold it face down and spring the inner corners. In either event he has only thirteen cards to run through before finding one of the same value as that called for, and if the suit is not the same it instantly tells him that it must be the thirteenth, or twenty-sixth card from the one found.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The performer may, of course, name every card in the deck, taking them off one at a time and calling the value and suit before he throws it face up on the table; but rather than make the trick so long, and such a constant repetition, it is preferable to name half a dozen or so, then execute a blind shuffle, have the deck cut again, and begin once more. By assuming to determine the value and suit by the sense of smell, or any chicanery, is more misleading, and has a better effect.</p>
<p class="p-indent">But the most remarkable feats that may be accomplished with the prearranged deck have yet to be described. The performer executes a blind shuffle thoroughly, requests a spectator to cut, and lays the deck face down on the table. Now some member of the company is requested to give any number between one and fifty-two, and the performer immediately names the card that will be found at that number. When this has been verified, and the shuffle and cut are again made, the performer lays the deck on the table and this time desires the company to give the name of any card in the pack. The performer at once calls the number at which it will be found, and proves his accuracy by slowly and openly counting the cards until it is reached. Of course, in each instance the performer has noted the bottom card after the cut was made, and before he placed the deck on the table. We have formulated the following rules for determining the card that will be found at the number given, and for ascertaining the number at which any particular card called for will be located.</p>
<p class="p-indent">To determine the card that is at any particular number, its suit is first determined. Divide the number by four, and if there is no remainder the suit is the same as the bottom card. If the remainder is one, the suit is the next in the order of suits. If the remainder is two, the suit is the second in the order of suits, or the other suit of the same color. If the remainder is three, the suit is the third in the order of suits, or the preceding suit, always calculating from the suit of the bottom card.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Now having ascertained the suit of the card at the number given, we proceed to learn its value. First divide the number by thirteen. If there is no remainder, the value is the same as the bottom card; but this is very improbable. If there is a remainder, name over mentally in the arranged order, as many cards as the remainder, beginning with the top card (which is next in order to the bottom), and the last card mentally named will denote the value of the card at the number given. Then the value and suit, or the name of the card at the number, is proclaimed to the company and the prediction verified.</p>
<p class="p-indent">To ascertain the number at which any particular card called for will be found, we first determine where the first card of that value is, and the suit of that first card. To find the number at which this first card of like value is located, mentally name over the arranged order, starting with the top card (which is next in order to the bottom) until the card of like value is reached. Of course, the number will be less than thirteen. Then find the suit of this card by dividing its number by four, as explained in the first rule. Now if the suit chances to be the suit of the card called for, the task is completed, but the odds are three to one against it. If the required suit is the next in the order of suits, add thirteen to the first number. If the suit required is the second in the order, add twenty-six to the first number; and if the suit of the card called for is the third in the order of suits, or the preceding suit, add thirty-nine to the first number, and in each instance it will be the number at which the card called for will be found.</p>
<p class="p-indent">We shall first give an example of determining the card that will be found at any particular number. Assume that the company gives the number thirty-five, and the bottom card is the King of Spades. Following the rule, we divide the number thirty-five by four, and get a remainder of three. This gives us the suit as the third in order from the bottom suit, or the preceding suit which is Hearts. Now to determine the value of the thirty-fifth card. The rule is “divide the number by thirteen,” and this gives us a remainder of nine. Now we mentally name our nine cards in their order, from the King at the bottom: “Three, Ten, Two, Seven, Nine, Four, Queen, Four, Ace.” The Ace being the ninth card determines the value. Hence the thirty-fifth card is the Ace of Hearts.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Dividing any number under fifty-two by thirteen is very simple; remembering that it goes evenly into thirteen, twenty-six, and thirty-nine, the remainder can be instantly calculated. When mentally running over the order, the values only are rehearsed, thereby taking half the time that would be required to rehearse both value and suit of each card. The suit having been obtained by the first division by four, only the value remains to be determined. A clever performer can name the card almost instantly.</p>
<p class="p-indent">As an example of determining the number at which any particular card will be found, we shall assume the company calls for the Ten of Diamonds, and the bottom card is the Six of Clubs. The rule is to “first, determine where the first card of the same value is, and the suit of that card.” We mentally rehearse the order from the Six at the bottom until we reach the first Ten, viz.: “Jack, Eight, King, Three, Ten,” finding the first Ten is the fifth card. Now to learn its suit, we divide by four, getting the remainder of one. This gives us the suit as the first in order from the bottom card. As the bottom card is a Club, the Ten located is a Heart. Now, as the card called for is the Ten of Diamonds, and Diamonds is the second suit from Hearts, we apply the rule and add twenty-six to the first number found (five), and get thirty-one, which is the number at which the Ten of Diamonds will be found.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The card conjurer’s repertory is never complete without employing the prearranged deck to some extent, and we believe the rules here given for determining the card at any number given, and the number of any card called for, are the first ever formulated for a fifty-two-card deck.</p>
<p class="p-indent" id="toc_2"><span class="i">The Traveling Cards.</span> — In Effect: A card is selected and replaced in the deck, which is then thoroughly shuffled. Performer now causes the cards to fly up his sleeve, one, two, or several at a time, producing them from the shoulder. The selected card is called upon to leave the deck at the company’s desire, and the operation is continued until the last several cards, which are noted, disappear from the hand and are slowly produced from the shoulder.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Sleights: Masterly feats of Palming and Unflinching Audacity.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Execution and Patter: “Ladies and gentlemen: I am constantly importuned by some of the most curious and least discerning of my auditors to explain the manner by which the results in certain tricks are achieved. While I consider it unprofessional to make these disclosures, I accede somewhat to the prevalent demand, and to-night I am going to take you especially into my confidence and expose one of the most important secrets in the whole realm of conjuring. Although many professors of the art vehemently deny the imputation, it is nevertheless a fact that the coat sleeve of the magician is to him much the same as a Saratoga trunk to a summer girl. Where does he get his bouquets of roses, baskets of eggs, dishes of swimming fishes? ‘Up his sleeve.’ How do his rabbits, bird cages and cannon balls disappear? ‘Up his sleeve.’ The saying is as true as it is ancient, and I shall prove my assertions by demonstrating the process; and though you may doubt my veracity, you certainly cannot question your own eyes.</p>
<p class="p-indent">“As a preliminary, I wish some one to kindly oblige by selecting a card from the deck. Any one you wish. Now please remember the name and place it again in the deck.” (Card is inserted, shifted and palmed.) “Will you shuffle for me?” (Deck is shuffled and returned. Place palmed card on top and palm off eight or ten more with it in right hand, hold deck in left.) “Now to illustrate the point in question, ladies and gentlemen, I am going to cause these cards to fly up my sleeve and out through the armhole here.” (Indicate place by thrusting the right hand into the shoulder of coat, and leave palmed cards there.) “Now, attention, please, and you may see them fly, or if you do not see them, you may hear them. First card, go!” (Click corner of deck with left little finger, carelessly show right hand empty, passing it rather quickly under coat to shoulder and produce bottom card. Show it and throw on table.) “Well, you see the first card obeyed me. Second card, pass!” (Produce another from bottom.) “Third card!” (Produce; each time clicking deck with finger as cards are ordered to pass, and showing cards as produced.) “But we have had a card selected and shuffled in the deck, and though we have no idea where it is I shall command it to fly up my sleeve at whatever number you may elect. What shall it be — four, five, six or seven? The sixth? Very well. As three cards have already passed, the selected card shall be the third one. Pass!” (Produce.) “Pass!” (Produce.) “Oh, what is the name of the card you selected? Jack of Hearts! Well, Jack of Hearts, it is your turn, sir. You will please oblige the company by flying up my sleeve.” (Produce top card, showing it to be the one called upon.) “To show the ease with which the cards travel I shall order several to pass together.” (Palm eight or ten in left hand from bottom.) “I have only to speak a little louder. Pass!” (Take deck in right hand and thrust left into right shoulder, withdrawing two or three of the palmed cards, leaving balance there.) “You see, I have three cards this time, and they travel equally well through either sleeve. Go! Four cards passed. Go! Three cards. It may be thought that I have duplicate cards concealed in my coat above, but that is easily disproved. You see there are no cards there. (Throw open fully right side of coat, from which all cards have been taken, and left side partially.) ”Besides, if you watch the deck you will notice that it is gradually growing less. To save time I shall hasten their activity. Go!” (Take deck again in left hand and produce balance in left shoulder, then palm again in left hand.) “Three cards that time. Pass!” (Thrust palmed cards in right shoulder and produce about half of them, then palm from top with right hand.) “Five that time. Go!” (Produce half with right hand, leaving balance.) “Four. Pass!” (Produce balance from left shoulder.) “Five cards. Pass!” (Change hands and produce balance from right shoulder.) “Now, how many have we left — one, two, three, four, five, six. Six only. Please note what they are. The King, Trey, Seven, Ten, Ace, and another Seven. Shall I pass them all at once, or one at a time? All together? Very well. Now, all of you, be gone!” (Bring left hand down below right, then when repassing right with quick outward movement propel cards into right palm with left first finger, making snapping noise, point right index finger at empty left hand for instant, then thrust right into left shoulder and slowly produce, showing cards are same as named.)</p>
<p class="p-indent">Although this trick is one of the oldest, it is one of the prettiest; and in the hands of a really clever artist never fails in producing a most pleasing and brilliant effect. Some performers produce the cards from the bosom beneath the vest, but we think the shoulder preferable. The cards can be slipped partially into the coat sleeve near top of shoulder, and their position securely maintained while the arms are moved about at will. The hand that holds the deck should be extended as the cards are commanded to pass. Using both sleeves gives excuse for changing deck from hand to hand, creating favorable and natural opportunities for palming, and also preventing the spectators anticipating which hand will produce the cards until it is too late.</p>
<p class="p-indent" id="toc_3"><span class="i">The Row of Ten Cards.</span> — In Effect: The performer shuffles the deck and lays the first ten cards face down in a row on the table. The performer now turns away while any number of the cards are transferred from one end to the other. Then, without having seen the action, or being aided in any manner, the performer immediately turns up one card whose value indicates the number of cards that were transferred; permitting this action to be repeated as often as desired, and determining the number moved each time.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Execution: Arrange ten cards in consecutive order from Ace to Ten, and place on top of deck, the Ten being uppermost. Blind shuffle and lay out the ten cards face down in a row on the table, begining at the left, so that the Ten is the left end card of the row. Explain to company that any number may be transferred from the right to the left end. As the order must be maintained, it is well to insist that but one card must be moved at a time. This will preserve the order, and not be likely to impress the company that there is any certain arrangement.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The rules for determining the number transferred from right to left are, first: The left end card will always indicate the number of the first transfer: i. e., when the first transfer of any number of cards is made, the value or number of spots of the card at the left end will be the number of the cards that were transferred; so that by turning up the left end card when the first move is made, the performer indicates the number that were transferred. On the second or any subsequent transfer, the card to turn is determined by adding the value, or number of spots, of the last card turned, to the number of the place it occupies in the row.</p>
<p class="p-indent">For example, the cards, when first laid out, will stand:</p>
<p class="p-indent"><span class="b">Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven, Six, Five, Four, Three, Two, One.</span> Assume the company transfer four cards, the order will then be:</p>
<p class="p-indent"><span class="b">Four, Three, Two, One, Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven, Six, Five,</span> so that when the rule for determining the first transfer is applied, and the left end card turned, it would indicate that four cards were transferred.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When the card is turned the calculation for determining the next transfer is at once made by the second rule, “adding the value of the card turned (four) to the number of its place in the row” (one), making five. When the next transfer is made the fifth card is turned and it indicates the number transferred. Let us prove this by assuming that two cards are now transferred. The new order will be:</p>
<p class="p-indent"><span class="b">Six, Five, Four, Three, Two, One, Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven.</span> Now, counting from the left, we turn the fifth card in the row, and find the Two, indicating the number transferred. Again add the number of turned card (two) to its place in the row (five), and we get seven, which will be the number in the row to turn, when the next transfer is made.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Of course, if this is continued, the number will in time be greater than ten; in which case ten is subtracted from the number, and the remainder indicates the position of the card to turn.</p>
<p class="p-indent">If the company should test the performer’s ability by making no transfer, or by transferring the ten cards, the card turned will always be the Ten; and in such case the performer will at once state that transferring all or none was not a part of the conditions made, thus concealing the fact that he cannot tell whether all or none were moved.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The first move should always be made by the performer when explaining the experiment to the company, and thereby avoid turning up the end card. As the performer makes the first transfer, he simply adds one to the number moved, one being the position of the card that otherwise would be turned, and he has the position for the turn when the company makes the first transfer.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Much effect may be obtained with this trick if the proper address and by-play are indulged. The performer may affect to accomplish the feat by mind reading, and increase the interest by failing to fathom the subtlety of some lady’s intellectual faculty, and easily wresting the secret from the coarser calibre of some gentleman, even against his will; and by pretending to have determined the number transferred before turning the card, and making the finding of the particular card also dependent upon some extraordinary power.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The trick is one of the very best of those not requiring sleight of hand.</p>
<p class="p-indent" id="toc_4"><span class="i">The Acrobatic Jacks.</span> — In effect: The Jacks are placed by the company at top, bottom, and middle of the deck, and keep constantly changing positions in most remarkable manner.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Sleights: One- and Two-Hand Shifts.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Patter and Execution: “Ladies and gentlemen: You have all doubtless been interested or amused, at one time or another, by the remarkable performances of educated animals. The dog, the pony, the elephant, and even the pig, have all been carefully trained to understand and obey each word or sign of their masters. But have you ever witnessed the performance of an educated pack of cards? You do not know that cards can be educated? I assure you that it is quite possible, and I shall demonstrate the truth of my assertion. Moreover, I have discovered in my efforts to educate my fifty-two pupils, that they, like the members of any other family, possess certain individual characteristics or temperaments, and I have endeavored to develop the special talents of each, in the direction most in keeping with the natural bent.</p>
<p class="p-indent">“I shall select the four Jacks for the purpose of illustrating how an original athletic tendency that was early manifested by them has been developed by a system of training, until they have acquired a degree of skill in acrobatic feats that is truly remarkable. I wish two ladies or gentlemen in the audience to assist me, by each holding two of the Jacks.” (Give two red Jacks to spectator, whom we shall designate as A., and two black Jacks to second spectator, whom we shall call B. Then to A.) “Will you, sir, place one of the red Jacks on top of the deck? Thank you. And will you (to B.) place one of the black Jacks in the middle of the deck?” (Open pack with left thumb bookwise, ready for the “Charlier Pass,” and when Jack is inserted shift packets.)</p>
<p class="p-indent">“Now, ladies and gentlemen, we have a red Jack on top, and a black Jack in the middle, and as a first display of their intelligence and training, I shall order them to change places. Ready. Go!” (Click deck with little finger and show change has taken place. Hand Jacks back to A. and B.) “You see that they are quite active and very obedient. We shall try them again and place them farther apart. (To A.) Place your red Jack at the bottom. (To B.) Place your black Jack on top. Now observe, I shall not touch the cards,” (Make gesture with the right hand as if to show that this hand would be the one necessarily employed, and as attention is attracted to it, shift with the left.) “but shall command the Jacks to perform a somersault from the top and bottom and meet in the middle. Attention. Go!” (Click deck, show top and bottom cards, then show Jacks in middle. Close deck with little finger between Jacks, and shift with both hands.) “That was a forward somersault, ladies and gentlemen, but they perform backwards just as easily. I shall show you. Ready. Go!” (Click deck and show Jacks again at top and bottom.)</p>
<p class="p-indent">“I trust I have impressed you somewhat with the intelligence and agility the Jacks possess in themselves, but for fear you may fancy that I have anything to do with their performance, I shall call upon all four Jacks to execute their grand and lofty tumbling at the same time, and I need not say to you, ladies and gentlemen, that however clever I might be, I could not possibly, of my own power, instantaneously change the positions of four cards at four different points.” (Give back Jacks to A. and B., and have A. place his at top and bottom, and B. place his two in middle. Insert little finger between middle Jacks and make shift with both hands.) “Now, please remember the order. The two red Jacks are at the top and bottom, and the two black Jacks are in the middle. This time I shall order the four to play leap-frog, and each take the place of the other. Ready. Go!” (Make click and show the changes have taken place.)</p>
<p class="p-indent">“I cannot doubt, after this demonstration, that you are quite satisfied the Jacks have been fairly well trained; and I am now going to make them perform their acrobatic feat very slowly, so that you may all see just how it is done.” (Give back Jacks to A. and B. Then to A.) “Place your two red Jacks again at the top and bottom;” (then to B.) “and now we shall have yours again in the middle. But stop! On second thought, as you are to see how it is done, I shall have the Jacks execute their somersaults while the deck is in your hands. I assure you they will perform equally well, and the moment you place your cards in the middle I wish you to hold the deck yourself.” (Apparently cut deck in the middle, but really make two-handed shift without bringing the two packets together again, holding the right-hand packet a few inches over the left when shift is made. Have Jacks placed between, and immediately close packets, putting deck in B.’s hands.) “Now, sir, don’t hold them too firmly, and watch them perform. I shall order all four to come together at the middle. All ready. Go! Did you see them go? Nor even feel them go? That is strange, for they certainly obeyed me. Look at the top and bottom cards. They have gone! Now look in the middle and you will find them all together as commanded.”</p>
<p class="p-indent" id="toc_5"><span class="i">A Mind-Reading Trick.</span> — Sleights: Stock Shuffle.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Execution and Patter: “Ladies and gentlemen, I shall next attempt an experiment in mind-reading, and though I do not claim to be an adept in the art, I have managed to obtain an understanding of its fundamental principles, and I shall endeavor to demonstrate that under favorable conditions I can actually read the thought that is most prominent in the mind of a willing subject. I wish some gentleman in the audience who is desirous of giving my ability a fair and impartial test, to take this deck of cards in his own hands and select any four he may wish for the purpose of my experiment.” (Give deck to spectator, who selects four cards at will, and take back deck.) “Now, sir, will you please make a mental note of any one card of the four you have selected, and as an aid to impress it most firmly, think of the one that to you may appear the most easily remembered. If you can associate one of them with a prominent date, or some incident in your own life, so much the better; and, if possible, disabuse your mind completely of the other three. Have you done this? Thank you. Now insert the four anywhere in the deck.” (Have cards replaced in middle, form break above, with right thumb at inner end, turn on side in left hand in position for blind shuffle. Under-cut to about half portion above break, shuffle off to break, run two, in-jog running, say, seventeen, out-jog and shuffle off. Under-cut to in-jog and throw on top. Under-cut to out-jog, run seven and throw balance on top. This action places two of the selected cards the ninth and tenth from the top, and the other two the eighteenth and nineteenth.) “Now, ladies and gentlemen, I have doubtless quite satisfied you, and most certainly myself, that the four cards drawn, including the particular one thought of, are hopelessly lost in the shuffle; but before attempting to read the mind of the gentleman who is so kindly assisting me in the experiment, I wish to be assured that he has got the card firmly established in his memory. Please watch these cards as I expose them. I shall not attempt to determine the card should it appear, by any outward sign you may make; in fact, I shall not look at either you or the cards.” (Expose seventeen cards, one at a time, throwing them carelessly one on the other, face up, on the table. Note the two selected cards, the ninth and tenth, as they fall on the table, paying no attention to the others.) “Did you see the cards you thought of?” (If he did, it is one of those noted. If not, it is one of the next two selected cards, which are now on top of deck. In either event:) “Well, I see that you are not at all uncertain about your memory.” (Now assuming the thought card is on the table; if they are of different color, by ascertaining the color of the thought card, its identity is established. If of the same color, but different suit, the suit will fix its identity. If both color and suit are the same, the value must be different, and the first question is asked concerning the point of difference. In whichever particular they differ, color preferred, gaze intently into the individual’s eyes.) “Please think of the color. Was it red?” (In event of it being so, it will be presumed that the guess was certain knowledge. Should he answer “No,” step close to him, taking his hand.) “Kindly permit me to come in contact with you, and I am certain to obtain a perfect impression of your thought.” (In either event the answer to the first question discloses the identity of the thought card.) “Oh, now I obtain a startlingly clear impression of the color, and the suit is Diamonds.” (Or, as the case may be.) “Now, please think solely of the value.” (Then, meditatively.) “Was it a Court or a Spot card? Now, as I close my eyes to prevent the confusion of external objects, I see it is covered with spots; one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Yes, it is the Seven of Diamonds.” (Or, as the case may be.)</p>
<p class="p-indent">Should the thought card not have been one of those exposed, and the chances are even, get a glimpse of the two top cards when replacing the table cards, or by shifting them to the bottom, and proceed in the same manner to ascertain which is the one thought of.</p>
<p class="p-indent" id="toc_6"><span class="i">Power of Concentrated Thought.</span> — In Effect: A spectator is requested to think of a card. Performer now lays deck on the table and requests another spectator to think of a number. Both spectators are now requested to whisper the name and number to each other, and mentally command the card thought of to take its position in the deck at the number thought of. The performer, who has not been near the deck in the interim, now requests the name and number, and permits a spectator to take the deck in hand and ascertain for the company that the silent injunction has been obeyed.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Execution: When requesting the first spectator to think of a card, employ one of the several methods given for “Determining the Card Thought Of.” Bring this card to the top. Secretly count seven cards at bottom and shift to top. Lay deck on the table, and request second spectator to “think of a number between one and ten.” The trick is based on the very strong probability that he will think of seven. Now babble nonsense about the power of concentrated thought upon even inanimate objects, requesting parties to whisper name and number, and mentally urge the required action. Now request name and number. If the number is seven, tell him to count off the number thought of, and turn the next card. If the number is eight, tell him to turn the card at the number thought of. However, should the number be more or less than either, the performer must pick up the deck himself, and when handing it to the spectator shift one from the bottom if the number is nine, or the requisite number from the top if less than seven. But the chances are ten to one that seven will be the number thought of.</p>
<p class="p-indent" id="toc_7"><span class="i">The Acme of Control.</span> — In Effect: A spectator selects two cards. Then takes the deck in his own hands, inserts the cards himself, shuffles to any extent, and returns deck to performer, who produces the selected cards instantly.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Sleights: Force and Palm.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Execution: Secretly place Five of Diamonds and Four of Hearts, at top or bottom of deck, and Four of Diamonds and Five of Hearts, in middle. Force the two middle cards on spectator, palm the other two when closing deck, and immediately hand the pack to spectator, telling him to insert the drawn cards and shuffle. Give him as little time as possible to meditate on his selection, as the trick is based on the similarity of the forced cards and the palmed ones. When the deck is returned, finish the trick as desired, and when producing the two palmed cards, boldly proclaim them as the ones drawn. If the trick be performed properly, not one in fifty will discover the imposition unless in the secret. The difference between the cards forced, and the cards produced, is so little remarkable that it is seldom or never detected. The Sevens and Eights, or the Deuces and Treys, or any two pairs of the spot cards of the same color, would probably answer as well.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The performer may engage to cause the selected cards to appear together at top, or bottom, or middle of deck, at the option of the company, and shift the palmed cards to such position as decided upon; or he may “pass” the cards under some object on the table, or to the pocket of a spectator, in which latter events he will have secretly placed the cards there beforehand instead of on top or bottom of deck.</p>
<p class="p-indent" id="toc_8"><span class="i">The Card and Handkerchief.</span> — In Effect: A card is freely selected, restored to the deck and thoroughly shuffled. The deck is now wrapped up in a borrowed handkerchief, which is held suspended by the corners, and upon command the selected card is seen to slowly project itself through the handkerchief and flutter to the floor.</p>
<div class="illustype_image"><div class="image"><img alt="e9780486156675_i0100.jpg" src="images/e9780486156675_i0100.jpg"/></div>

<p class="p-indent">Execution: Borrow a rather large handkerchief first. Place it in full sight in vest or on table, then have card selected and replaced in deck, shift to top, palming in right hand, and return deck to be shuffled. Now take corner of handkerchief in each hand, show both sides by crossing right hand over left, keeping right palm to person, then throw handkerchief over right palm, one corner lying along right arm, and diagonal corner hanging down over right fingers the hand being about the middle. Now take back deck with left hand and place it on hand-kerchief lengthwise over right hand, seizing it by ends with that hand, and squaring up palmed card against it, at same time taking out the crimp so that it will lie flatly. Then, with the left hand, bring up the overhanging corner of handkerchief, covering the deck, and showing the right-hand fingers; seize sides of deck with left hand, gather back the folds of handkerchief with right so that the selected card will be retained at its inner end and suspend the deck by the folds with the right hand, holding well above the pack. (See <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156675_c03.html#int_99" id="ref_int_99">Figs. 99</a> and <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156675_c03.html#int_100" id="ref_int_100">100</a>.) Now command the selected card to appear, first requesting the drawer to give its name, and by giving slight up-and-down jolts to the deck, the card will slowly emerge from the back, having all the appearance of forcing its way through the center of the handkerchief at the lower end of the suspended deck.</p>
<div class="illustype_image"><div class="image"><img alt="e9780486156675_i0101.jpg" src="images/e9780486156675_i0101.jpg"/></div>

<p class="p-indent" id="toc_9"><span class="i">The Top and Bottom Production.</span> — In Effect: Four persons freely select two cards each. All are restored to the deck, which is thoroughly shuffled. The top and bottom cards are now shown not to be any of those selected. The performer then causes the several pairs to instantly appear at top and bottom as called for.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Sleights: Two-Handed Shift, Palm and Blind Shuffle.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Execution and Patter: “Ladies and gentlemen: For the purpose of this experiment, I shall request several individuals in the company to each select two cards. I wish you to take particular note of those you draw so that you will know them again.” (Allow four persons, whom we shall call A., B., C. and D., to freely select two cards each. When all are selected, take them back in the reverse order, saying to D.) “Will you kindly place your two in the deck?” (When this is done, shift, palm off, and hand deck to be shuffled. Take back deck, replace palmed cards on top, turn to C.) “Please place your two in the middle.” (Shift without closing two packets, appearing as a simple cut, and have C.’s cards now placed on D.’s. Again shift to top, and execute blind shuffle, jogging first card, and leaving selected cards in the middle. Now cut to, and include jog card, and have B.’s cards placed on first two pairs. Repeat the action taken last and have A.’s cards replaced in same manner, then shift and blind shuffle, and run three extra cards on top of the four pairs which are now on top of the pack.)</p>
<p class="p-indent">“Now, ladies and gentlemen, we have had eight cards selected by four of you, and all have been thoroughly shuffled in the deck. It is needless to say that I do not know which cards were selected, or that I have no idea where they are. However, we shall look at those near the top and bottom to see if any are in that position.” (Turn deck over and show two or three of the bottom cards, turn deck back and take off top three in right hand, showing faces; then as replacing, push over next card with the left thumb, so that left little finger may be inserted under it, and shift all four to the bottom. This will leave A.’s two cards at top and bottom.) “Were any of the selected cards among those I have just shown? No? Well, I am about to perform what under ordinary circumstances would be a very difficult feat indeed, but with this trained and perfectly educated deck, becomes ridiculously simple and easy. It is to cause the selected cards to appear at the top and bottom, in any order that you may desire.” (To A.) “If you will tell me, sir, what cards you drew, I shall call upon them to appear instantly. You say they are the Seven of Diamonds and the Jack of Spades? Well, now, Seven and Jack, come!” (Hold deck in left hand, click with little finger, show bottom card, take off top and show with right hand, push next card over side when replacing and shift two to bottom. This leaves B.’s cards at top and bottom.) “You see how willingly the cards obey me. Now, sir (to B.), let me know the cards you selected and we shall see if they are as active.” (When names are given, produce as before. Now execute blind shuffle again, running three extra cards on top. Again show several at bottom, then show top three, and this time push over two cards with left thumb when replacing top cards, and shift five to bottom. This leaves B.’s cards in position.) “We have still another pair to find, and though they seem excessively modest in keeping away from the top and bottom, I have no doubt they will be in evidence when called upon. What two did you draw, sir?” (to C. When names are given show as before, then shift two cards to bottom, leaving D.’s at top and bottom. Now affect to have forgotten about D.’s cards, and drop the deck on the table as though the trick were terminated. When reminded by the company that D.’s cards were not produced, show some slight embarrassment.) “Yes, that is true. I had forgotten that all were not produced, and as the deck has been out of my possession, I cannot exact the same obedience from them. However, if you will tell me the names of the last two cards, I shall try to find them myself.” (When names are given, seize deck with right hand, toss it a yard or so straight upward, retaining top and bottom cards in hand by friction, thrust hand among descending pack and apparently find the last two in the act.)</p>
<p class="p-indent" id="toc_10"><span class="i">The Three Aces.</span> — In Effect: The Ace of Diamonds, Ace of Clubs and Ace of Spades are shown to the company and laid face down on the table. Then one is picked up and inserted in the middle of the deck, another is placed on the bottom, and the third is placed on the top. A single true cut is now made and the three Aces are found together.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Sleight: Prearrangement.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Execution: Secretly place the Ace of Diamonds on top of the deck. Arrange the other three Aces in the left hand, fanwise, face up, the Ace of Hearts below the other two, and showing in the middle. The figure of the heart is inverted and shows at the angle made by the other cards, so that the part seen is diamond-shaped. The corner of the Ace on the left of the fan just covers the small heart figure of the index, but fully exposes the small letter “A.” (See <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156675_c03.html#int_101" id="ref_int_101">Fig. 101</a>.) This arrangement can be made in a moment. The appearance is most innocent and surprisingly deceptive.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Turn the faces to the company, and then lay the three cards face down on the table, still in the same fan position, and with the same hand. Now take up the deck, and, if desired, execute a blind shuffle, retaining top Ace. Hold deck in left hand, pick up the top card of the fan, which is the Ace of Hearts, and insert it in middle of deck. Pick up next Ace, carelessly showing it, and place it on bottom. Show third card as it is placed on top. Lay the deck on the table and request spectator to cut; and as the three Aces, i. e., the two black Aces and Ace of Diamonds, were on top and bottom of deck, all will be found together.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_net"><div class="image_net"><img alt="e9780486156675_i0102.jpg" src="images/e9780486156675_i0102.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-c"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156675_c03.html#ref_int_101" id="int_101"><span class="b">Fig. 101</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent" id="toc_11"><span class="i">The Card and Hat.</span> — In Effect: A borrowed hat is placed upon the table. A card is now freely selected and given to a second spectator to hold. Attention is now drawn to the hat, which is shown to be empty, and it is again placed on the table, but crown up. The selected card is then restored to the deck by the spectator, who is permitted to take the deck in his own hands. The performer now exercises very remarkable powers by first determining the name of the selected card, and then causing it to wing an invisible flight from the deck to a position beneath the hat on the table, where it is found by a spectator.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Sleights: Top Change and Palm.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Execution: Borrow the hat first and place it rim up on the table. Have a card selected by spectator on the left. Take it from him with the right hand, and when turning to spectator on the right, make “Top Change,” and request second spectator to hold the card between his two palms; which will prevent him from looking at it. Now palm top card in right hand and give deck to first spectator to hold. Step towards table, getting glimpse of palmed card, and pick up the hat with right hand, fingers well inside, thumb across rim, calling attention to the fact that it is empty, and showing the inside. Now turn the rim down and place the hat again upon the table, working the palmed card up along the inside with the fingers, and releasing it as the hat is laid down. Care must be taken to leave no crimp in the card.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Now take deck from first spectator, request second spectator to hold it in the hand that happens to be uppermost. Then take the card from his other hand and insert it in the deck, and have spectator shuffle thoroughly.</p>
<p class="p-indent">As the action is now complete, make by-play of determining the name of the drawn card, by tracing the very faint impression that it left on the palm of spectator who held it; and cause it to speed from the deck, under the hat, visibly if desired, expressing surprise that no one sees it going, and have spectator raise the hat to prove there is no hocus-pocus.</p></div></div>
