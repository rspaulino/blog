<p class="p"><span class="i">The Expert at the Card Table,</span> with the cryptic name of S. W. Erdnase on its title page, is the most famous, the most carefully studied book ever published on the art of manipulating cards at gaming tables. Books had been written previously about card cheating, but none went into such technical detail or contained so many trade secrets never before revealed.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Magicians treasure <span class="i">The Expert at the Card Table</span> because its “sleights” — false cuts, false shuffles, second deals, bottom deals and so on — are as essential to a card conjuror as they are to crooked gamblers. The author was almost as interested in card magic as in gambling methods. Originally, he intended his book to deal only with gambling techniques, but he was persuaded to add a section on magic to make the book more salable.</p>
<p class="p-indent">In 1994 Ricky Jay was hugely successful in Manhattan with his one-man magic show featuring card magic. A highlight of his performance was a presentation of the classic four-ace trick described by the author in terms of queens instead of aces. When I saw Ricky demonstrate this trick on television, a few years before he opened his New York show, I was astounded to learn that the “patter” he used was taken word for word from the Erdnase book.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Although the first edition of 1902 had slim sales, mainly through magic shops, the book gradually became recognized as <span class="i">the</span> classic treatise on how to cheat at card games. It has never been out of print. Dai Vernon, one of the great creative card magicians of this century, knew the book by heart. He even annotated an edition, titled <span class="i">Revelations,</span> in 1984. A more elaborate commentary, <span class="i">The Annotated Erdnase,</span> by Darwin Ortiz, appeared in 1991.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Who was S. W. Erdnase? Early on it was noticed that when this name is spelled backward it becomes E. S. Andrews. Half a century ago I was instrumental in tracking down the author’s true identity. He was Milton Franklin Andrews, a native of Hartford, Connecticut, who left home as a youth to become one of the nation’s most successful card swindlers. A man with a violent temper and a fondness for prostitutes, he was wanted by the police as a prime suspect in the murder of Bessie Bouton, one of his many girl friends, in Cold Springs, Colorado.</p>
<p class="p-indent">In 1905, when the San Francisco police finally located Andrews and broke into his apartment, he shot himself and the woman then living with him. He was 33. (The sordid details of Andrews’ character and ignoble life are covered thoroughly in <span class="i">The Man Who Was Erdnase,</span> a book on which Jeff Busby and I assisted the author, Bart Whaley. It was published in 1991 by Busby, who owns a magic-supply house in Wallace, Idaho. Whaley’s richly illustrated and carefully documented biography also discusses many recent improvements on Andrews’ methods.)</p>
<p class="p-indent">Although there no longer is any doubt that Milton Andrews was the author of <span class="i">The Expert at the Card Table,</span> a great mystery still remains. Andrews never went to college, and a lengthy letter he sent to the <span class="i">San Francisco Examiner,</span> offering to surrender to the police if they would meet certain <span class="i">conditions,</span> makes clear that he could not have achieved the polished prose in which this book is written. Who, then, was the book’s skillful editor?</p>
<p class="p-indent">We know that Andrews paid a Chicago printer to publish his book in 1902. We also know that he paid a Chicago artist, Marshall D. Smith, to illustrate the book. I had the pleasure of locating the elderly Smith when he still lived in Chicago. He told me how, as a young man, he had gone to Andrews’ hotel room on a cold winter day to make pencil sketches of the gambler’s hands as he held the cards above a felt-covered board that you see in some of the drawings. But who did Andrews pay to edit his manuscript? To this day the question remains unanswered. In <span class="i">The Man Who Was Erdnase,</span> Whaley gives excellent reasons for thinking it was William John Hilliar, an English magician who settled in America and who ghosted books by magicians T. Nelson Downs and Howard Thurston.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Whether Andrews actually killed Bessie Bouton we shall never know. It is possible he was no more than a likely suspect. There is no doubt, however, that his short life was dangerous and tormented. He must have known that his book would be his only claim to undying fame. He was immensely proud of his skills and his original contributions to card work and, as he tells in his book, was frustrated by the necessity of keeping his talents hidden. Surely that was why he concealed his last name in so simple a way that it would be easy to discover.</p>
<p class="p-indent">There is controversy over how much material Andrews omitted — secrets he preferred not to reveal — as well as the extent to which he may have knowingly given inferior methods. In some cases Smith’s drawings are misleading. For instance, the illustration for the slip cut (<a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156675_c01.html#int_1" id="ref_int_1">Figure 11</a>) shows how <span class="i">not</span> to perform this valuable move. The text itself does not support the picture. Nor does the text describe the best technique. As all card magicians should know, a slip cut is best made by pressing the index finger on the top card so that, when the bottom half of the deck is cut forward, the card slides with it to give the impression that the top half has been taken. Then the hand comes back to pick up the top half, which has not moved, and place it on the bottom half.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Much has been written in magic books and periodicals about Andrews’ bottom deal. Almost all experts agree it is not the best technique. It is possible, I suppose, that Andrews may have practiced until he could deal undetectable bottoms by his method — or did he intentionally describe a technique he knew few readers could master? The same can be said of the bizarre “shifts” he invented.</p>
<p class="p-indent">In explaining how to deal seconds, Andrews again describes the more difficult method — one in which two cards are pushed over each time — but omits the easier method known today as “strike seconds.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">We know that Andrews knew more than he gives in his book because in real life he was once caught cheating on a ship, while returning from Australia, by using what is called “the spread.” Nowhere in his book is this maneuver described.</p>
<p class="p-indent">On page 19, after giving an excellent method for holding a bottom stock during a riffle shuffle, Andrews mentions two riffle shuffles that preserve a deck’s entire order. They are known today as the “push through” and the “pull out” or “strip out” shuffle. Andrews gives two reasons for not explaining either shuffle: Each is “very difficult to perform perfectly,” and “there is seldom a desire and never a necessity of preserving the complete order at a card table.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Here, then, is Andrews’ masterpiece. No matter that some of his techniques have been improved over the years. Most of his methods are as useful today for magicians and card hustlers as they were in 1902. The book is still the bible of card “mechanics,” and as much a delight to read as it was in the early years of this century.</p>
