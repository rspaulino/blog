<p class="p">There is no branch of conjuring that so fully repays the amateur for his labor and study as slight-of-hand with cards. The artist is always sure of a comprehensive and appreciative audience. There is no amusement or pastime in the civilized world so prevalent as card games, and almost everybody loves a good trick. But the special advantage in this respect is that the really clever card-handler can dispense with the endless devices and preparations that encumber the performer in other branches. He is ever prepared for the most unexpected demands upon his ability to amuse or mystify, and he can sustain his reputation with nothing but the family deck and his nimble fingers, making his exhibition all the more startling because of its known impromptu nature and simple accessories.</p>
<p class="p-indent">To the student who wishes to make the most rapid progress toward the actual performance of tricks, we suggest that he first take up the study and practice of our “System of Blind Shuffles” as taught in the first part of this book, acquiring thorough proficiency in forming and using the “jog” and “break,” which make this style of shuffle possible. We are aware that all conjurers advise the shift or pass, as the first accomplishment, and while we do not belittle the merits of the shift when perfectly performed, we insist that all or any of the various methods of executing it, are among the most difficult feats the student will be called upon to acquire, and imposing such a task at the outset has a most discouraging effect. But so far as we can learn from the exhibitions and literature of conjurers, not one of them knows of, or at least employs or writes of, a satisfactory substitute; hence their entire dependence upon that artifice to produce certain results.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When the blind shuffles with the coincident jog and break are thoroughly understood, the student should take up our “System of Palming,” also treated in the first part, paying particular attention to the “bottom palm,” and with even a moderate degree of skill in these accomplishments he will be enabled to perform many of the best tricks that conjurers make entirely dependent on the shift.</p>
<p class="p-indent">For example, the common process for obtaining possession of a selected card when it is replaced in the deck, is to insert the little finger over it, make a shift bringing the lower packet with the selected card to the top, palm it off in the right hand, and give the deck to the spectator to shuffle. Now it may be a matter of opinion, but we think it would appear quite as natural if the performer were to shuffle the deck himself, immediately when the card is replaced in the middle, then palm off and hand the deck to the spectator to shuffle. If the spectator shuffles for the purpose of concealing any knowledge of its whereabouts, the performer’s shuffle may reasonably be expected to increase the impression that it is hopelessly lost, and especially because his shuffle is made without the least hesitation, turn, swing, concealment or patter, and apparently in the most natural and regular way. Then the performer’s shuffle gives a tacit reason for holding the deck while the card is inserted, instead of permitting the spectator to take the deck in his own hands. Well executed, the blind shuffle brings the card to the top or bottom at will, defying the closest scrutiny to detect the manipulation. The card is then palmed while squaring up, and the deck now handed over for further shuffling.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Should the performer wish to palm off the selected card without employing a shuffle, we believe the “Diagonal Palm-Shift” is easier and far more imperceptible than the shifting of the two packets and then palming, assuming that the different processes are performed equally well. For this reason we suggest the early acquirement of the mentioned shift.</p>
<p class="p-indent">However, the enthusiast will not rest until every sleight in the calendar has been perfectly mastered, so that he may be enabled to nonplus and squelch that particularly obnoxious but ever present individual, who with his smattering of the commoner slights always knows “exactly how it is done.” Acquiring the art is in itself a most fascinating pastime, and the student will need no further incentive the moment the least progress is made.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The finished card-table expert will experience little or no difficulty in accomplishing the various sleights that lie at the bottom of the conjurer’s tricks. The principal feats have been already mastered in acquiring the blind shuffles, blind cuts, bottom deal, second deal, palming and replacing, the run, the crimp, culling, and stocking; and his trained fingers will readily accommodate themselves to any new positions or actions. But the mere ability to execute the slights by no means fits him for the stage or even a drawing-room entertainment. In this phase of card-handling, as with card-table artifice, we are of the opinion that the less the company knows about the dexterity of the performer, the better it answers his purpose. A much greater interest is taken in the tricks, and the denouement of each causes infinitely more amazement, when the entire procedure has been conducted in an ordinary manner, and quite free of ostensible cleverness at prestidigitation. If the performer cannot resist the temptation to parade his digital ability, it will mar the effect of his endeavors much less by adjuring the exhibition of such sleights as palming and producing, single-hand shifts, changes, etc., until the wind up of the entertainment. But the sleights should be employed only as a means to an end.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The amateur conjurer who is not naturally blessed with a “gift of the gab” should rehearse his “patter” or monologue as carefully as his action. The simplest trick should be appropriately clothed with chicanery or plausible sophistry which apparently explains the procedure, but in reality describes about the contrary of what takes place.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The principal slights employed in card tricks, that are not touched upon in the first part of this book, are known as “forcing,” “changes,” “transformations,” and various methods of locating and producing selected cards. We shall also describe other methods of shifting and palming. We should mention that a shift is termed by the conjurer a “pass.”</p>
<div class="section1"><a id="title45"></a><h1 class="title-section1" id="toc_1"><span class="b">SHIFTS</span></h1>
<p class="p" id="toc_13"><span class="i">Single-Handed Shift</span>. — This is known to conjurers as the “Charlier Pass,” and we presume was invented by the famous magician of that name.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Hold the deck in the left hand face down, between the thumb tip at one side and first joints of second and third fingers at opposite side, first joint of little finger at end, and first finger extended at bottom. To make the shift release the lower portion of the deck with the thumb, letting it fall into the palm (see <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#int_65" id="ref_int_65">Fig. 65</a>), then push up the finger side of the fallen portion, with the first fingertip, until it reaches the thumb which is still supporting the upper portion. Now extend the second and third fingers slightly so that the thumb side of the upper portion will pass the upturned side of the lower portion (see <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#int_66" id="ref_int_66">Fig. 66</a>), then straighten out the first finger allowing the upper portion to drop down into the palm and the lower portion on top of it.</p>
<div class="illustype_image"><div class="image"><img alt="e9780486156675_i0066.jpg" src="images/e9780486156675_i0066.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-c"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#ref_int_65" id="int_65"><span class="b">Fig. 65</span></a></p></div></div>
<div class="illustype_image"><div class="image"><img alt="e9780486156675_i0067.jpg" src="images/e9780486156675_i0067.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-c"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#ref_int_66" id="int_66"><span class="b">Fig. 66</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">The little finger held at the middle of the end is of great assistance in this shift, giving better control of both portions, and enabling the performer to hold the deck much nearer a vertical position. The shift is invariably made with a slight swing, or up-and-down motion of the hand. It can be executed very rapidly, and is the favorite one-handed shift with most experts. It is usually employed to receive and bring a selected card to the top. As the performer extends the deck to have the selected card returned, he raises the upper portion with the tip of the thumb, and the selected card is naturally placed in the opening. In this position the shift is half made, the condition being the same as when the first movement of dropping the lower portion into the palm takes place. The performer now with an up or down motion, or swing toward the person, tilts up the lower portion with the first finger and the shift is made, bringing the selected card to the top to be disposed of as desired.</p>
<p class="p-indent" id="toc_14"><span class="i">The Longitudinal Shift.</span> — This shift, for which we have to thank no one, is given a very long name, but the reader who is interested sufficiently to practice the process, will find it a very short shift and comparatively an easy one.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Hold the deck in the left hand, face down, first joint of thumb at middle of one side, first joint of second finger, and second joint of third finger, at opposite side, and the lower corner of the deck fitting in between the third and little fingers, at the base of little finger, the first finger curled up against the bottom. Now bring the right hand over; second, third and little fingers at outer end, first finger curled up on top, thumb at inner end. Separate the deck with the right thumb, at the inner end only, about half an inch, and press the third joint of the little finger in between the corners of the two packets to be shuffled. (See <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#int_67" id="ref_int_67">Fig. 67</a>.) Now the deck is ready for the shift, but the right hand may be withdrawn without disclosing the break at the inner corner, or the fact that the little finger runs between the packets. The left thumb and finger hold the packets firmly together and the deck could not have a more innocent appearance.</p>
<p class="p-indent">To make the shift, bring the right thumb against the side of the first finger, straighten out the first finger, press the end of the lower packet in against the left little finger and down against the curled-up first finger, with the four right-hand fingers; and with the left little finger and thumb draw off the upper packet toward the person (see <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#int_68" id="ref_int_68">Fig. 68</a>), and as the lower packet springs into the right palm bring the upper packet back underneath.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_net"><div class="image_net"><img alt="e9780486156675_i0068.jpg" src="images/e9780486156675_i0068.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-c"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#ref_int_67" id="int_67"><span class="b">Fig. 67</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">The right thumb takes no part in the shift, and a favorable feature of the operation is that it may be performed without the right hand appearing to be used at all. The right fingers may be held almost straight, and the palm well away from the deck, the hand being slightly closed as the lower packet springs up. It can be made with practically no noise, and the action is well covered.</p>
<p class="p-indent">If desired this shift can be made with almost the whole deck exposed, by employing right second and third fingers only at end, and keeping first finger curled up on top. In this case the right thumb tip catches the end of the lower packet as it springs up.</p>
<p class="p-indent" id="toc_15"><span class="i">The Open Shift.</span> — This is another outcome of our constant but ever failing efforts to devise a perfect shift, and incidentally one that is not readily anticipated by the manner of holding the deck. The particular feature of this method is the open position in which the cards are held, the entire deck being exposed to view.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Hold the deck in the left hand, the first joint of the thumb at one side, first joints of second, third, and little fingers at opposite side, the little finger holding a break between the two packets near the corner, and the little and third fingers being separated about one inch. The first finger is curled up against the bottom. Bring the right hand over, and seize the ends of deck close to right side corners, with the second finger and thumb tips, the thumb seizing only the lower packet below the break, the first finger curled up on top. (See <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#int_69" id="ref_int_69">Fig. 69</a>.) The left third and little fingers take no part in the action and are held idly out of the way.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_net"><div class="image_net"><img alt="e9780486156675_i0069.jpg" src="images/e9780486156675_i0069.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-c"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#ref_int_68" id="int_68">Fig. 68</a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">To make the shift, curl the right first finger back over the side of the deck, between the left little and third fingers, until the root of the fingernail rests against the edge of the top card. Now press the upper packet against the left thumb and downward by straightening out the right first finger, at the same time drawing the lower packet to the right and upward with the right thumb and second finger (see <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#int_70" id="ref_int_70">Fig. 70</a>), and as the sides clear each other tilt the left side of the lower or right-hand packet up on top. The upper packet should not fall into the left hand. It must be caught by the curled-up first finger and first joints of the other left fingers, as it clears the side of the under packet. The left thumb never leaves its position against the side of the upper packet, and the tip should be held sufficiently above it to receive the lower packet as it is brought on top. The left little finger is not inserted between the two packets, but merely holds the break.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_net"><div class="image_net"><img alt="e9780486156675_i0070.jpg" src="images/e9780486156675_i0070.jpg"/></div>

<p class="p-indent">The shift can be made like a flash, and with the cards in perfect order. When executed perfectly, the only sound is the slipping of one packet over the other. There is no snap or crack, and it is in every way worthy of the practice necessary to acquire it. With the face of the deck turned upward it produces a “transformation” that ranks with the best of them.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_net"><div class="image_net"><img alt="e9780486156675_i0071.jpg" src="images/e9780486156675_i0071.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-c"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#ref_int_70" id="int_70"><span class="b">Fig. 70</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">The same shift may be made with the deck held flat in the palm, the left thumb lying idly across the top, and the first finger at the side with the others, but we much prefer the former position though it is a great deal more difficult. The latter position is an excellent one when it is necessary to make a shift that is apparently a simple cut, in which event the right hand does not tilt its packet on top. The hands immediately separate and the under packet is placed on top when desired.</p>
<p class="p-indent" id="toc_16"><span class="i">The S. W E. Shift.</span> — We have not dubbed the following process with our initials because we wish to appear “big on the bills,” but merely to give it a name. Still, we must confess to some satisfaction in having originated what we believe to be the most rapid, and, for certain purposes, the most perfect shift ever devised. The method is practically the same as the “Longitudinal,” but as the deck is held crosswise it is much more rapid. The position is open and natural, and the shift possesses many advantages for conjuring purposes.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Hold the deck in the left hand, face down, first joint of the thumb against middle of one end, second, third and little fingers against the opposite or lower end, little finger holding a break between the two packets at end, by the corner of the lower packet being between the little and third fingers, the little finger lying partially across the corner of the under packet. (See <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#int_71" id="ref_int_71">Fig. 71</a>.) This position, like that of the “Longitudinal,” allows the tips of the second, third and little fingers to appear over the top of the deck, and the fact that there is a break is not apparent to a spectator. The first finger is curled up against the bottom. The break is held only at the lower end, and at the inside, the other fingers and thumb holding the packet firmly together.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_net"><div class="image_net"><img alt="e9780486156675_i0072.jpg" src="images/e9780486156675_i0072.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-c"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#ref_int_71" id="int_71"><span class="b">Fig. 71</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">Now bring the right hand over the lower or right-hand end of the deck, and seize the sides as close as possible to the lower corners, between the second and third fingertips and thumb, the first finger curled up on top out of the way. This leaves at least two-thirds of the deck in view. (See <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#int_72" id="ref_int_72">Fig. 72</a>.) To make the shift raise the right thumb to the edge of the side, draw the top packet in and down with the left thumb and little finger, and press the lower packet out and down, between the right second and third fingertips and the left first finger which is curled up underneath; the left second finger at the end helps to control the lower packet as it is pressed out. This action will tilt the opposite sides of both packets upward, and as they clear each other the right thumb tip catches the under packet, and the left third finger catches the upper packet and it is brought back underneath. (See <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#int_73" id="ref_int_73">Fig. 73</a>.)</p>
<div class="illustype_image_net"><div class="image_net"><img alt="e9780486156675_i0073.jpg" src="images/e9780486156675_i0073.jpg"/></div>

<p class="p-indent">When the shift is mastered the entire action is accomplished by a pressure in opposite directions on the lower packet, and the packets reverse like a flash, but of course it must be practiced slowly until the knack is obtained. The positions of the hands may be taken with easy deliberation, as there is no indication that a shift is meditated. It may be made with the hands stationary without exposing the action. With the deck face up it makes an instantaneous “transformation,” and the position of the deck permits the operator to get a glimpse of the index without being observed.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_net"><div class="image_net"><img alt="e9780486156675_i0074.jpg" src="images/e9780486156675_i0074.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-c"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#ref_int_73" id="int_73"><span class="b">Fig. 73</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">The shift may be made with the right hand almost entirely covering the deck, but this alters the whole character and aim of the process, the main endeavor is to make it as open and free from concealment as possible.</p>
<p class="p-indent" id="toc_17"><span class="i">The Diagonal Palm-Shift.</span> — The plan of having one or several selected cards inserted in the deck, then forcing them through slightly diagonally, and twisting them out to the top or bottom, is well known to most conjurers, and by some is treated as a blind shuffle. That the process is not satisfactory is seen by the fact that it is seldom or never employed, and but rarely even mentioned in any list of card sleights. Our efforts to improve, or rather to combine the first part of this manoeuvre with a process for palming the inserted cards, instead of placing them on top or bottom of the deck, is shown in the following description. The action is silent, rapid, undetectable if well performed, and takes place under the ordinary movement of passing the deck to be shuffled.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Hold the deck in the left hand, by sides, between the first joints of thumb, and second, third and little fingers, first finger curled up at bottom. Allow spectator to insert selected card in outer end of deck, pushing it in until about half an inch only protrudes. Now bring the right hand over deck with the little finger at side corner of protruding card, second and third fingers at middle of end, and first finger close to end corner, and the thumb close to the inner end corner of the deck. Apparently push the card straight home, but really push the protruding end with the right little finger, about a quarter of an inch to the left, so that the right first finger can push the tilted corner down the side of the deck, the card moving slightly diagonally, and the opposite corner just grazing the right thumb, and protruding about three-quarters of an inch. The left third and little fingers are released sufficiently to allow the card to protrude at the side. The left thumb now takes the place of the right first finger, pushing the corner flush with side of deck. (See <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#int_74" id="ref_int_74">Fig. 74</a>.)</p>
<div class="illustype_image_net"><div class="image_net"><img alt="e9780486156675_i0075.jpg" src="images/e9780486156675_i0075.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-c"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#ref_int_74" id="int_74"><span class="b">Fig. 74</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">The diagonal position of the selected card is now perfectly concealed, and the deck is held in a natural and regular manner. A little practice at the diagonal slide enables one to get the card in that position instantaneously. The next action is to palm the selected card in the left hand, as the right passes the deck to be shuffled.</p>
<p class="p-indent">With the left little finger against the side of card, swing or turn it inward, using the right thumb as a pivot, straighten out left first, second, and third fingers, catching the outer end as it turns, and at the same time sliding pack outward and to the right, the left hand turning over and inward with the palmed card (see <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#int_75" id="ref_int_75">Fig. 75</a>) and the little finger slipped to the end.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_net"><div class="image_net"><img alt="e9780486156675_i0076.jpg" src="images/e9780486156675_i0076.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-c"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#ref_int_75" id="int_75"><span class="b">Fig. 75</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">There should be no force or twist employed, the card running out as freely as though drawn. The card and the deck must continue on the same plane until quite free of each other. The left little finger may press the side of the card very slightly upward, so that as it is palmed it will bend into instead of away from the left hand. As the card is being turned by the little finger the left thumb is raised, letting the right thumb with the corner of deck pass under it, so that the card can lie parallel with, but still above, the left palm. As the deck is slid out, the right thumb slides along the side of the card, and it is not actually palmed until the hands are almost free of each other.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The whole action may be made quick as a flash and without a sound, yet when performed quite slowly is still a perfect blind. The left hand may seize the deck by the corner, between the first finger and thumb, as the card is palmed, leaving the right hand free (see <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#int_76" id="ref_int_76">Fig. 76</a>); but the beauty of the shift is in the natural and simple manner of palming the selected card, by the ordinary movement the right hand makes in passing the deck to be shuffled.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_net"><div class="image_net"><img alt="e9780486156675_i0077.jpg" src="images/e9780486156675_i0077.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-c"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#ref_int_76" id="int_76"><span class="b">Fig. 76</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">We wish to particularly impress our readers with the merits of this palm-shift. It is not difficult if a proper understanding of the action is obtained, and it is of very great assistance in card tricks. It dispenses to a great extent with the regular shifts and blind shuffles, and it can be accomplished under the very nose of a shrewd spectator without an inkling of what is taking place. The usual procedure of card-handlers is to insert the little finger over the selected card, shift the two packets and palm the card from the top in the right hand. This process takes more time, the shift must be concealed by a partial turn, swing or drop of the hands; and to palm, the deck must be covered at least for an instant. In the palm-shift described the card is placed in its diagonal position with apparently the customary movement of squaring up, and the rest is accomplished, as it were, by handing the deck to be shuffled.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Several cards may be palmed together, when inserted at different points, or from one point, or from top, or bottom. If the top card is to be shifted, it is slipped into the same diagonal position and held in place by the right little finger being curled up on top. The action is the same. When the single-card palm-shift is acquired, the rest will come easily.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title46"></a><h1 class="title-section1" id="toc_2"><span class="b">THE BLIND SHUFFLE FOR SECURING SELECTED CARD</span></h1>
<p class="p">Hold the deck across the left hand and when selected card is inserted, form break over it with left little finger close to side corner. Now seize the deck by the ends from above with the right thumb and second finger, and close to right side corners; the right thumb taking up the break at the end; and with the left thumb and fingers turn the deck down on its side into the left palm in the position given for blind shuffling, the right hand remaining stationary, the thumb and finger being the pivots, as it were, allowing the deck to turn, and the right thumb still holding the break. The action appears quite natural, and enables the thumb to hold the break without moving. Immediately begin the shuffle. Under-cut to about half portion above break, shuffle off to break, in-jog first card and shuffle off. Then under-cut to in-jog and shuffle off. This action leaves the selected card at the bottom. Square up, palm bottom card in left hand and pass deck to spectator to shuffle.</p>
<p class="p-indent">In making the bottom palm it matters little whether one or several cards are palmed, and the action is quicker if not particular about the number.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Of course the selected card may be brought to the top just as easily, as an understanding of the “System of Blind Shuffles” makes clear. The only difference in the foregoing action would be to jog the second card instead of the first when the break is reached, and then under-cut to the jog and throw on top, instead of shuffling off. But we consider the left-hand work, or bottom palming, far superior to palming from the top, and the several methods given in the first part of the book will be found instantaneous, undetectable, and up to the present unknown and consequently not suspected.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title47"></a><h1 class="title-section1" id="toc_3"><span class="b">FORCING</span></h1>
<p class="p">Many of the best card tricks are dependent upon having the company select one or more certain or particular cards, which after being replaced in the deck and shuffled, are reproduced in various ways at some stage of the proceeding. Compelling the company to select such particular cards, without in the least suspecting the choice is influenced in any manner, is called “forcing.” It is probably used to a greater extent than any other expedient, excepting the shift.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The usual method of “forcing” is to bring the particular card to the middle of the deck by means of a shift, and hold its location by inserting the little finger at that point. Now the performer, advancing the hands toward the spectator, opens the deck slightly fanwise, pushing the cards with the left thumb one under the other into the right palm, the right fingers aiding the operation; apparently to enable the spectator to take any card he may wish. As he shows an indication of selecting one, the passing movement, which by this time has reached the located card, is stopped and the located card exposed a trifle more than the others. An unsuspicious person will naturally select the one easiest to seize. In any case, he can get no other, as the fingers and thumbs of the performer’s hands hold the balance of the cards firmly. Should the spectator’s fingers touch other than the particular card the performer carelessly draws back and closes the deck as though he thought a card were seized, then, with an excuse, opens the deck again. But a little practice at forcing enables a clever performer to almost place the particular card in the spectator’s hand without the least show of design. The action should be easy, but rather rapid, and if the first spectator approached shows a disposition to be over discriminating he should be passed immediately and the next one may display greater alacrity. But should the first individual get the wrong card, there is no harm done. The performer passes on to a more obliging spectator and forces the particular card, and completes the trick in contemplation. Then the first card drawn is returned to the deck and used in some trick that does not require a prior knowledge. If two or three cards are noted and located together the force becomes simpler, as a greater liberty may be allowed in the selection and, of course, the order of the several cards enables the performer to determine the particular card as it is selected.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title48"></a><h1 class="title-section1" id="toc_4"><span class="b">PALMING</span></h1>
<p class="p">In addition to the methods given in the first part of our book, which we consider the best for general purposes, we shall describe several processes that may be employed advantageously under special circumstances.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The top cards may be palmed apparently without touching the deck in the following manner: Hold the deck across the left palm, the little finger well inserted under the cards to be palmed, the first, second and third fingers holding the cards firmly in place. Now move the right hand, through some natural motive, over the left, and as it passes within one inch or two straighten out the left-hand fingers, forcing the cards up into the right palm with the little finger, which is under them. The right hand either continues its movement as it slightly closes over the palmed cards or else seizes the deck in a manner to expose it fully, and the left hand makes some gesture or natural movement.</p>
<p class="p-indent">A simple way to palm one top card is to push it slightly over the side under cover of the right hand, then press down on its outer-end corner with the right little fingertip, and it will spring up into the right palm.</p>
<p class="p-indent">In all cases of palming the deck should be covered for the smallest possible space of time, and the covering and exposing should be made under some natural pretext, such as squaring up the cards, or passing the deck to the other hand, or changing its position in the hand, or turning it over.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_net"><div class="image_net"><img alt="e9780486156675_i0078.jpg" src="images/e9780486156675_i0078.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-c"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#ref_int_77" id="int_77"><span class="b">Fig. 77</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent" id="toc_18"><span class="i">The Back Palm.</span> — We are afraid the above title is a misnomer. The cards to be concealed are transferred to the back of the hand. Hold the card in the right hand face up between the tip of the thumb at one end and tips of second and third fingers at opposite end, the first joints of the first and little fingers hold the sides. (See <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#int_77" id="ref_int_77">Fig. 77</a>.) To make the “palm,” slip the tips of the second and third fingers under the end of the card and curl them down until they come under the thumb, at the same time pushing the card outward with the thumb until the inner corners reach the first and little fingers, which hold it in position. (See <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#int_78" id="ref_int_78">Fig. 78</a>.) Now, straighten out the four fingers, clipping the corners of the card between the little and third fingertips and the first and second fingertips, and the card lies along the back of the hand. (See <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#int_79" id="ref_int_79">Fig. 79</a>.)</p>
<div class="illustype_image_net"><div class="image_net"><img alt="e9780486156675_i0079.jpg" src="images/e9780486156675_i0079.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-c"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#ref_int_78" id="int_78"><span class="b">Fig. 78</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">To bring it to the front again curl the four fingers again into the palm, straighten the first fingertip a little so that the thumb may take its place holding the card, then draw the card as far as possible toward the wrist with the thumb and little finger, straightening out the other fingers, then clip the corner between the first and second fingertips, and slide the little finger along the side of the card until it is straight out, this time clipping the outer corners between the same fingers instead of palming in the usual way.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_net"><div class="image_net"><img alt="e9780486156675_i0080.jpg" src="images/e9780486156675_i0080.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-c"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#ref_int_79" id="int_79"><span class="b">Fig. 79</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">Several cards may be transferred back and forth in this manner, and one at a time may be produced from the back without showing the rest. Perfection in the feat enables a performer to show both sides of the hand, transferring the cards as it is turned over. A slight up-and-down motion and a backward turn of the wrist is used.</p>
<p class="p-indent">As an exhibition of dexterity this is probably unsurpassed in card manipulation, but it is of little aid in the performance of tricks. However, everything may be put to some use, and the back palm once helped us out of a difficult situation — “but that is another story.”</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title49"></a><h1 class="title-section1" id="toc_5"><span class="b">CHANGES</span></h1>
<p class="p">Under this general heading we shall describe several of the best methods known for secretly exchanging one or several cards separated from the pack, for others in the pack or held in the other hand.</p>
<p class="p-indent" id="toc_19"><span class="i">The Top Change.</span> — Hold the deck in the left hand crosswise, face down, the thumb resting across the top. Hold the card to be exchanged in the right hand between the thumb and first fingertips, thumb on top, finger under. Now the hands are brought together for an instant by an easy swing, both hands moving in the same general direction but one hand faster than the other. As they meet the left thumb pushes the top card slightly over the side, the right hand places its card on top and clips the protruding card between the tips of the first and second fingers, carrying it off (see <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#int_80" id="ref_int_80">Fig. 80</a>), the left thumb retaining the now top card and sliding it back into position on the deck. In theory it seems that this action will be very easily noticed. In practice, if cleverly performed, it is almost impossible to detect. The general movement or swing of the hands is not stopped when the exchange is made but continued until they are separated again by some little distance, and the swing should be taken naturally, with some ulterior motive, such as placing the card on the table or giving it to some one to hold. A slight turn of the person may bring the hands easily together. The swing may be made in any direction, in or out, up or down, to the right or left, the one hand following or passing the other, but in no case stopping until well separated again.</p>
<div class="illustype_image"><div class="image"><img alt="e9780486156675_i0081.jpg" src="images/e9780486156675_i0081.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-c"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#ref_int_80" id="int_80"><span class="b">Fig. 80</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent" id="toc_20"><span class="i">The Bottom Change.</span> — In this process the action is much the same, the difference being that the card in the right hand is passed to the bottom of the deck, the right hand carrying off the top card as before.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_net"><div class="image_net"><img alt="e9780486156675_i0082.jpg" src="images/e9780486156675_i0082.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-c"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#ref_int_81" id="int_81"><span class="b">Fig. 81</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">Hold the right-hand card between the thumb and first and second fingertips, first finger on top. Hold the deck with the thumb and first finger, dropping the other fingers slightly to receive the right-hand card, drawing it back under the deck as the hands separate. The top card is pushed over as before and carried off by the right thumb and first finger. (See <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#int_81" id="ref_int_81">Fig. 81</a>.) The swing of the hands is made in the same manner. The only difficulty in this change is getting the card fairly back under the deck with the left fingers.</p>
<p class="p-indent" id="toc_21"><span class="i">The Palm Change.</span> — In this process an entirely different subterfuge is employed, and it is probably the most ingenious ever devised for the purpose.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The two cards to be exchanged are held in the right hand by the ends between the second and third fingertips and the thumb, and close together, so that when shown to the company they appear as one. The right hand is now turned palm down and the left hand apparently takes the card that was exposed, laying it on the table, but in reality takes the second card, leaving the other one palmed in the right hand. This is done by seizing both cards between the left thumb and second and third fingers, and drawing out the upper one with the thumb and pressing the lower one up into the right palm with the left fingers as the top one is drawn off. (See <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#int_82" id="ref_int_82">Fig. 82</a>.)</p>
<p class="p-indent">This change is one of the simplest and easiest feats in the whole range of card sleights, and yet one of the most useful and undetectable. The action should be performed in about the same time and manner that would ordinarily be taken in transferring a card from one hand to the other.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_net"><div class="image_net"><img alt="e9780486156675_i0083.jpg" src="images/e9780486156675_i0083.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-c"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#ref_int_82" id="int_82"><span class="b">Fig. 82</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent" id="toc_22"><span class="i">The Double-Palm Change.</span> — This method may be employed to exchange one or several cards. The cards to be exchanged lie in a packet on the table face up. The other cards are secretly palmed face down in the left hand. The left hand now picks up the packet on the table by the sides, between the thumb and second and third fingertips, and transfers the packet to the right hand. As the left hand turns palm up the right hand palms the packet just picked up and seizes the packet in the left palm by the sides, carrying it slowly and openly away, and the left hand is seen empty. (See <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#int_83" id="ref_int_83">Fig. 83</a>.)</p>
<div class="illustype_image_net"><div class="image_net"><img alt="e9780486156675_i0084.jpg" src="images/e9780486156675_i0084.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-c"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#ref_int_83" id="int_83"><span class="b">Fig. 83</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">As the right hand palms the upper cards the left first finger curls up under the palmed cards, bending them upward, thus enabling the right hand to seize them easier and also effectually taking out the crimp or bend that may have been caused while so closely palmed.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The only objectionable feature of this change is that the right hand carries the packet away by the sides, while it may have been noticed that the packet first in view was seized by the ends. But this is a splendid change for many purposes.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title50"></a><h1 class="title-section1" id="toc_6"><span class="b">TRANSFORMATIONS. TWO HANDS</span></h1>
<p class="p">The card conjurer in many instances purposely produces the wrong card, and when his error (?) is proclaimed by the company or the individual, he coolly proposes to “make good” by transforming the wrong card into the right one. This is usually done by placing the wrong card on the top or bottom of the deck and making the “transformation” with the aid of both hands or only one.</p>
<p class="p-indent" id="toc_23"><span class="i">First Method.</span> — The right hand holds the wrong card, which has just been exhibited; the left hand holds the deck between the thumb and second, third and little fingers at the sides, first finger at end, the back of deck to the palm and the selected card on the bottom. The deck is inverted or the hand turned palm down, so that the bottom card cannot be seen. The right hand now openly places the wrong card on the bottom of the deck and carelessly shows the palm empty. Then the tips of the right-hand fingers are placed against the bottom of the deck, both hands turning it up in view, showing the wrong card that was just placed there. But as the deck is turned up the right fingertips push the wrong card up against the left first finger, about one inch, so that the right palm a little below the base of the fingers may be pressed against the selected card, which is the next one. This card is drawn down slowly by pressing against it, the downward movement being apparently to give the company a full view of the wrong card. (See <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#int_84" id="ref_int_84">Fig. 84</a>.) When the ends of the two cards pass each other the lower card is tilted on top and the right palm again covers the whole deck, carrying the selected card along, and the left first finger presses the wrong card back into position. The performer now pronounces the talismanic word, shows the right hand empty, and the transformation accomplished.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_net"><div class="image_net"><img alt="e9780486156675_i0085.jpg" src="images/e9780486156675_i0085.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-c"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#ref_int_84" id="int_84"><span class="b">Fig. 84</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">Cleverly executed, this is a very effective sleight, and there is little or no difficulty in acquiring it. It may be performed rapidly or slowly, as the operator fancies.</p>
<p class="p-indent" id="toc_24"><span class="i">Second Method.</span> — Hold the deck in the left hand, between the thumb and second, third and little fingers, at sides, first fingertip against the back near end, and the back, or top card, the selected card; the wrong card being on the bottom, or placed there and held in full view. To make the transformation bring the right hand over the deck with the four fingertips against the end. Slide or push the selected card with the first fingertip up against the right-hand finger ends, drawing the deck down toward the wrist until it clears the lower end of the selected card, which is pressed into the right palm by the left first finger. (See <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#int_85" id="ref_int_85">Fig. 85</a>.) Then slide the deck back to its first position. This sleight may be made in an instant and the action is fully covered.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_net"><div class="image_net"><img alt="e9780486156675_i0086.jpg" src="images/e9780486156675_i0086.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-c"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#ref_int_85" id="int_85"><span class="b">Fig. 85</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent" id="toc_25"><span class="i">Third Method.</span> — Hold the deck in left hand, resting on its side across the third joints of the four fingers, tip of thumb on top side, face to the company. Cover face with the right hand held quite flatly; tilt top side of deck slightly toward right hand; drop left thumb to the back, and push up the top card. As it comes above the side bring the right hand up and back over the left thumb, catching the up-coming card against the side of the hand and palming it as it is carried over, the left thumb aiding the palming by pressing the card home. The left thumb then instantly retakes its position on the top side of the deck. The movement of the right hand is made apparently to show the bottom card. The right hand now again covers the deck for an instant, leaving the palmed card there.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Palming the back card in this manner may be done very rapidly, but a slow movement is satisfactory.</p>
<p class="p-indent" id="toc_26"><span class="i">Fourth Method.</span> — The action of this transformation is identical with the Third Method, but the first and little fingers are held against the ends of the deck close to the lower corners, the thumb and second and third fingers at the top and bottom sides as before. In this position the deck is held much more firmly, and it becomes easier for the left thumb to push up one card at a time, the fingers at the ends restraining the other cards. The right hand performs its part as in the Third Method. The improvement is our own. (See <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#int_86" id="ref_int_86">Fig. 86</a>.)</p>
<div class="illustype_image_net"><div class="image_net"><img alt="e9780486156675_i0087.jpg" src="images/e9780486156675_i0087.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-c"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#ref_int_86" id="int_86"><span class="b">Fig. 86</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent" id="toc_27"><span class="i">Fifth Method.</span> — Hold the deck in the left hand, thumb and three fingers at opposite sides, first finger against end. Cover the deck with the right hand but run the right thumb underneath. Now draw out the under card with the right thumb, palming it, and again cover the deck, leaving the palmed card on top.</p>
<p class="p-indent" id="toc_28"><span class="i">Sixth Method.</span> — Now we introduce another “homemade” article, and consequently unknown up to the present. We think it is very pretty.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Hold the deck in the left hand by the ends, between the tips of the thumb and second and third fingers, the first finger resting against the side and the little fingertip against the bottom, close to the corner, the face of the deck to the company and the finger end down. Bring the right hand forward so that the little fingertips meet at the corner of deck, the palm partly facing the company and showing the hand empty, the wrists being about six inches apart. Now, with the left little fingertip push the corner of the lower card slightly over the side, and clip it with the right little fingertip, so that it is firmly held between the two tips (see <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#int_87" id="ref_int_87">Fig. 87</a>), and press it down against the left third finger, turning the right hand over and moving the upper end of the deck to the left at the same time. This action will cause the lower card to swing out at the upper end, and it is caught and palmed by the right hand as the hand turns over. The left little finger is extended as the turn is made, pressing the card firmly against the right fingers. (See <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#int_88" id="ref_int_88">Fig. 88</a>.) Now the right hand immediately seizes the deck close to the lower end, and the left hand releasing it, is shown empty. Then the left hand again seizes the deck, but this time by the sides, with the little finger against the lower end. The right hand is now released and passed rapidly downward over the deck, leaving the palmed card on top, and the right hand is shown empty. The left little finger at the end aids the replacing by catching the palmed card as the right hand is drawn down.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_net"><div class="image_net"><img alt="e9780486156675_i0088.jpg" src="images/e9780486156675_i0088.jpg"/></div>

<p class="p-indent">Of course, the performer makes the movements of passing the deck from hand to hand and showing the hands empty, ostensibly to prove that no palming takes place. The act of palming, if cleverly performed, is absolutely undetectable; the right hand turning over just in time and sufficiently to cover the card coming out, but not obstructing the continued view of the face of the deck. The actual palm can be made as rapidly as desired and without a sound. Our readers should cultivate this “transformation,” though it may take some little practice to acquire perfectly.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_net"><div class="image_net"><img alt="e9780486156675_i0089.jpg" src="images/e9780486156675_i0089.jpg"/></div>

<p class="p" id="toc_29"><span class="i">First Method.</span> — Hold the deck in the left hand, the thumb well extended across the face, first finger at end, second and little fingers at side and third finger curled in as far as possible underneath. Grip the top card with the thumb and draw it back, tilting up the deck with the third finger until the top card clears the side (see <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#int_89" id="ref_int_89">Fig. 89</a>), then press the top card down between the curled-up finger and deck by bringing the thumb again to its original position across top. (See <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#int_90" id="ref_int_90">Fig. 90</a>.) The third and little finger ends steady the pack as it is tilted upward, but the first finger takes no part in the action. The top card must be gripped well into the root of the thumb and drawn back as far as possible as the deck is being tilted up.

<p class="p-indent">The action should be covered by a swing, and as it is extremely difficult to execute without some noise the company might be informed that if they cannot see the “transformation” they will be permitted to hear it. The rapidity of the action is proportionate to the skill of the performer, and it may be made with the hand in any position.</p>
<p class="p-indent" id="toc_30"><span class="i">Second Method.</span> — The following process is another of our innovations, and it will be found easy, extremely rapid and without the least noise, a rare combination in one-handed manœuvers.</p>

<p class="p-indent">Hold the deck in the left hand, one side resting on second joints of second and third fingers, tip of thumb on top side, first and little fingers at opposite ends. Slip the thumb over the side so that its tip rests against the bottom card, and push it up and over on top, the card turning over in transit, so that if it were face down at bottom it will be face up on top. (See <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#int_91" id="ref_int_91">Figs. 91</a> and <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#int_92" id="ref_int_92">92</a>.) The ends of the second, third and little fingers hold the deck in position as the card is pushed over, and the four finger ends unite in getting it squarely in place when on top.</p>

<p class="p-indent">The action should take place under cover of a short arm movement. Raise the hand up and in toward the person, and shift the position of the thumb just as the hand is about to make the down and outward movement, under which the action takes place. If one card is faced before it is exposed the deck will appear to be held face up, and the transferring of cards from the bottom may be continued to any desired extent. Though the process is very easy and can be performed with a motion too rapid to see, some little practice must be put in to acquire the knack of getting out the bottom card.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Both these one-hand transformations are much easier performed with about two-thirds of the deck.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title52"></a><h1 class="title-section1" id="toc_8"><span class="b">BLIND SHUFFLES, RETAINING ENTIRE ORDER</span></h1>
<p class="p">In the first part of our book we described two blind shuffles for retaining either the upper or lower half of the deck in the same order, yet apparently shuffling the whole deck. Retaining the whole deck in a prearranged order is seldom or never attempted, or even desired, at the card table. But the conjurer performs many very interesting tricks through such an arrangement; therefore it is necessary to provide a blind shuffle that will not disturb any part of the deck. The following methods for retaining the entire order will be found sufficiently deceptive for his purpose, though by no means so perfect in appearance as the processes already described:</p>
<p class="p-indent" id="toc_31"><span class="i">First Method.</span> — Hold the deck in the left hand, crosswise, in the customary manner for the hand shuffle. Under-cut with the right hand about three-quarters of the deck, and bring it down in the usual way of shuffling on top of the packet in the left hand, dropping a small packet from the top. Now, in raising the right hand again, still in the ordinary manner, seize the lower packet that was first left in the left hand between the right third finger and thumb, bringing it up with the rest of the cards, the packet that was dropped from the top now falling against the left fingers, concealing the fact that the under packet is withdrawn. (See <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#int_93" id="ref_int_93">Fig. 93</a>.) Now, with the left fingers tilt the packet over against the left thumb, and drop another small packet from the top of the right-hand portion into the left hand between its packet and the fingers, still with the usual movement for shuffling. The left thumb now tilts the packet back on the other, and the right hand makes its customary movement downward, but this time drops the lower packet that is held between the third finger and thumb, by simply releasing the pressure of the third finger. Now the left-hand portion is again tilted against the thumb, the right hand dropping another packet from the top, then the left-hand packet is tilted back, and the right hand throws the balance on top. This process leaves the order the same, the deck having received but a simple cut.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_net"><div class="image_net"><img alt="e9780486156675_i0094.jpg" src="images/e9780486156675_i0094.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-c"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#ref_int_93" id="int_93"><span class="b">Fig. 93</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">The right hand makes five up-and-down movements in the ordinary or regular manner of shuffling, and without hesitating for an instant. The left fingers and thumb keep up the process of tilting its portion back and forth, allowing the right-hand packets to fall above and below it. The actions of the right hand in bringing up the first packet from the left hand, with the first upward movement, and in releasing it again on the third downward movement (instead of dropping a packet from the top) are undetectable if the shuffle is performed with some degree of rapidity and smoothness. It is not at all difficult, but some practice is necessary.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The mode of shuffling over and under the left-hand packet is commonly employed, and incites no notice. The shuffle may be repeated as desired, and should be varied with an occasional cut.</p>
<p class="p-indent" id="toc_32"><span class="i">Second Method.</span> — This blind shuffle, or rather riffle, will require considerable practice to perform nicely, but it is worth it.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Seize the deck with both hands, face down, second and third fingers at one side, thumbs at the opposite side, little fingers at opposite ends, held somewhat under the deck, and first fingers curled in with tips on top. The second fingers touch each other at middle of side, and the thumbs touching at opposite side. Each hand occupies identically the same position. Now divide the pack with the thumbs and draw off the upper portion with the right hand; place the inner corners of the outer ends together so that the two packets form a sharp angle, but the right-hand packet about half an inch further out. Now riffle or spring the corners of the left-hand packet into the right-hand packet, both thumbs springing the cards, but beginning with the left thumb and finishing with the right, so that the left hand holds several cards that are not interwoven at the bottom, and about half a dozen of the right-hand packet are still free on top. (See <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#int_94" id="ref_int_94">Fig. 94</a>.) Now shift the left hand slightly so that the four fingers lie across the bottom of its packet, and with the right thumb spread the top cards fanwise over the left packet, at the same time bringing the inner ends of the two packets toward each other, twisting out the riffled upper corners and replacing the right-hand packet on top.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_net"><div class="image_net"><img alt="e9780486156675_i0095.jpg" src="images/e9780486156675_i0095.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-c"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#ref_int_94" id="int_94"><span class="b">Fig. 94</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">As the inner ends are brought together the two packets are spread somewhat, and the right little and third fingers twist out the bottom card first, and bend it in on top of the left-hand packet slightly in advance of the rest. This prevents any of the other cards going wrong. The more fanwise the packets are spread during the operation the more perfect the blind. The deck should be squared up rather slowly, the left thumb and fingers holding the deck with the cards in their irregular condition, the right hand being released and pushing or patting the cards into position. Care should be taken not to riffle the corners far into each other. The merest hold is sufficient, and in fact if the packets can be held under perfect control the cards need not be interlocked at all, and the difficulty of the twisting out process is avoided. By slightly spreading the two packets as the springing or riffling of the sides is continued the appearance of the corners being interlocked is perfectly maintained.</p>
<p class="p-indent">This shuffle can be performed very rapidly, and with perfect control of the cards, and it is an excellent one for conjuring, as these performers never riffle on the table. But, as we have mentioned, it is difficult, and if the operator is not a skillful card-handler he will find it quite a task to even riffle in the two packets, and this is the simplest part of the operation.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When this riffle is alternated with the foregoing shuffle it requires very close scrutiny of a very knowing card expert to detect the fact that the operation is a blind.</p>
<p class="p-indent" id="toc_33"><span class="i">Third Method.</span> — This is another form of the second method. The deck is seized with the thumbs and fingers at the ends instead of at the sides, the little fingers going under the sides, the positions being identical, only that the deck is turned endwise.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When the deck is separated into the two packets the thumbs riffle the inner corners together, the left fingers are shifted across the bottom, the right thumb spreads the top cards over the left-hand packet, and the right hand brings the outer ends of the two packets toward each other, twisting out the interlocked corners and placing the right-hand packet again on top in much the same manner.</p>
<p class="p-indent">In this method the packets are easier controlled, and it is hard to say which is the better. But we think for conjuring purposes the more the methods for blind shuffling are varied the greater are the probabilities of convincing the company that the cards are genuinely mixed; providing always, that the several methods employed appear the same as those in common every-day usage.</p>
<p class="p-indent" id="toc_34"><span class="i">Fourth Method.</span> — This is a very barefaced blind, simple, extremely easy, and surprisingly deceptive when cleverly performed.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Rest the deck on its side in the left hand in the usual position for shuffling, but hold the first finger against and along the end. Under-cut about half the deck with the right hand, the first finger on the top side, and make the ordinary movement to interlock or force the right-hand cards down among those in the left hand, bringing the sides together for that purpose. Allow a few of the cards from the top of the right-hand packet to drop down on top of the other packet, but prevent them from going quite to the left palm with the left thumb. Now keep up a constant lateral movement with the right hand, shifting the packet rapidly lengthwise about half an inch each way, as though forcing the two packets to interlace, but really dropping the upper cards on top of the left-hand packet, by holding the right-hand packet slightly diagonally over the lower one, so that the inner corner of the right-hand packet is just over the side of the lower one. Drop the top cards over in this manner until all are apparently interlocked about half way or more, then strike them on the top side with the fingers held flatly, driving them down even, and square up the deck.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The first finger held against the end and the first or top cards of the right-hand packet, going over immediately as the sides are brought together, effectually conceal the ruse. If the process of actually interlocking the cards is tried it will be seen how perfectly the action can be imitated. An occasional cut tends to increase the deception.</p>
<p class="p-indent" id="toc_35"><span class="i">Fifth Method.</span> — This process is very much employed by many clever card conjurers who ought to know better, and we include it only because it is in common use and to suggest its rejection. It consists in pushing small packets alternately from the top and bottom of the portion held in one hand to the bottom and top of the portion held in the other.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The deck is held in the left hand and several cards are pushed over by the left thumb into the right hand. Then the left fingers push several cards from the bottom on top of the right-hand cards. Then the left thumb again pushes several from the top, but these are received under the right-hand portion. The left fingers now push several from the bottom to the top of the right-hand portion, and so on until the left hand is empty.</p>
<p class="p-indent">This clumsy juggling might prove satisfactory if performed by an awkward novice before a parcel of school children, but it appears simply ridiculous in the hands of a card conjurer, who, it is presumed, knows how to shuffle a deck in the customary manner, and with at least the degree of smoothness that any ordinary person might possess.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title53"></a><h1 class="title-section1" id="toc_9"><span class="b">METHODS FOR DETERMINING A CARD THOUGHT OF</span></h1>
<p class="p">In three of the following instances the spectator has no choice, as he is supposed to think of a card he sees, and the performer shows him but one, though apparently without design. In the fourth instance a most ingenious ruse is employed, the spectator being given perfect freedom, yet the card is determined almost as surely.</p>
<p class="p-indent" id="toc_36">A. Hold the deck in the left hand, thumb across top near inner end, and first and second fingers at side. Bring over the right hand and seize deck with fingers at outer ends, thumb at inner end, and hold so that the outer ends of the cards may be sprung or “ruffled,” with the faces towards the spectator. Requesting him to think of a card, spring the ends rapidly, stopping for an instant at any one place (see <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#int_95" id="ref_int_95">Fig. 95</a>), then completing the ruffle. The springing is performed at such a pace that the spectator can recognize but one card, which is more fully exposed by the momentary lull in the springing, and at this point the performer forms and holds a break with end of left second finger. At the end of the first ruffle ask if card has been noted, and if not repeat the action, but of course hesitating at some other point.</p>
<div class="illustype_image"><div class="image"><img alt="e9780486156675_i0096.jpg" src="images/e9780486156675_i0096.jpg"/></div>

<p class="p-indent" id="toc_37">B. Hold the deck lengthwise in the right hand, face to palm, between second joint of thumb and ends of fingers. Bend finger end downward and allow ends to escape rapidly, springing them into the left hand in the usual manner of the flourish. Hesitate, or stop the springing for an instant, at any stage of the operation (see <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#int_96" id="ref_int_96">Fig. 96</a>), and the only card that the performer can notice or fairly distinguish will be the probable selection of the spectator. Of course the performer conceals his notice of the cards as far as possible.</p>
<p class="p-indent" id="toc_38">C. Hold the deck across the left palm face down, extend it toward a spectator, requesting him to think of one of them. As he cannot see any he will naturally attempt to take the deck in his hands, or cut off a portion. In either case let him cut only, and the moment he sees the bottom card of his packet thank him and take back the cut, holding a break at the location.</p>
<div class="illustype_image"><div class="image"><img alt="e9780486156675_i0097.jpg" src="images/e9780486156675_i0097.jpg"/></div>

<p class="p-indent" id="toc_39">D. This cunning and absolutely unfathomable stratagem must have been devised by an individual of truly Machiavellian subtlety. The deck is held in the left hand face down and the cards are taken off in the right hand and held face to the spectator. Each card is counted as it is taken off the deck, and the right-hand packet is kept well squared up, so thai but one card remains exposed to view. As the cards are exposed the hands are parted some little distance, and the action of drawing off the cards is made uniform, neither rapidly nor slowly. Now the operator looks covertly into the eyes of the spectator and he sees with surprising distinctness that they follow the movements of his right hand in taking off and exposing the cards. The moment the eyes rest, or lose their intensity, the performer notes the number of the card, but continues the drawing off process. Shortly, asking if a card has been thought of, he closes up deck, secretively counts off to the number, and produces a will. Of course a break may be held at the card noted, but the counting avoids the least change in the right-hand action.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title54"></a><h1 class="title-section1" id="toc_10"><span class="b">TO GET SIGHT OF SELECTED CARD</span></h1>
<p class="p">A simple plan of catching a glimpse of a selected card is to have i inserted at the end and prevent the spectator from pushing it quite home by squeezing the deck. Then, with the card protruding about a quarte of an inch, covertly turn the deck partially over by passing it to the othe hand, and get sight of the index.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Another and better plan is to push the selected card through diagonally, and square up, leaving it protruding at the inner end. In this case the index is at the diagonal corner and more easily seen, and the fact of the card protruding can be covered completely.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Still another plan is to insert the left little finger under the inserted card and slightly tilt up inner left-hand corner to note the index.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title55"></a><h1 class="title-section1" id="toc_11"><span class="b">THE SLIDE</span></h1>
<p class="p">Hold the deck in the left hand, back to palm, fingers and thumb at opposite sides. Show face of deck to company, then turn it down, and with tips of third and little fingers slide the bottom card half an inch or so towards wrist (see <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#int_97" id="ref_int_97">Fig. 97</a>), and draw the next card out at end with right-hand fingers. Of course this has the appearance of drawing off the card just shown to the company. It is a form of exchange that may be occasionally employed.</p>

<div class="section1"><a id="title56"></a><h1 class="title-section1" id="toc_12"><span class="b">FAVORITE SLEIGHTS FOR TERMINATING TRICKS</span></h1>
<p class="p" id="toc_40"><span class="i">Catching Two Cards at Fingertips.</span> — A favorite manner of terminating a trick that requires the production of two selected cards is to bring one to top and one to bottom, then toss the deck in the air a yard or so straight upward, retaining the top and bottom cards by pressure and friction of thumb and fingers, then thrusting the hand among the cards as they descend, apparently finding the selected cards in the act.</p>
<p class="p-indent" id="toc_41"><span class="i">Leaving Selected Card in Hand of Spectator.</span> — A plan for the production of a single card, as the last of a series, is to bring it to the bottom face up and request a spectator to hold the deck firmly by the corner, thumb on top. By striking the deck forcibly from above all the cards will fall from his hand save the selected card, which is retained by the friction of the fingers and left face up in his hand.</p>
<p class="p-indent" id="toc_42"><span class="i">The Revolution.</span> — This is a great favorite for terminating certain tricks, and has a very showy appearance. If the top card is pushed over the side about half an inch, and the deck dropped flatly on the table from a point of perhaps twelve or fifteen inches above it, the top card will turn over in the descent and lie fairly on top of the deck, face exposed. The turn is caused by the resistance of the air against the protruding side. The facts that the card to be produced is on top, and that a card is pushed over, are concealed.</p>
<p class="p-indent" id="toc_43"><span class="i">Cards Rising from the Hand.</span> — The selected cards are brought to top of deck and the pack is held in the left hand, thumb at one side and lying straight along with tip near end, second, third and little fingers at opposite side, and first finger at back. The cards are pushed up by first finger, the thumb and other fingers being released sufficiently to allow their rising, but retaining their position. (See <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156675_c02.html#int_98" id="ref_int_98">Fig. 98</a>.) When the cards are raised to nearly the full length the right hand takes them off. Some address is necessary to push up a card with one finger, but a little practice, and especially at the manner of holding the deck, so as to keep the card in position and yet not retard its upward course, will soon acquire the ability. If the first and second fingers are placed at the back the feat becomes much easier, but of course the effect is proportionately lessened.</p>
