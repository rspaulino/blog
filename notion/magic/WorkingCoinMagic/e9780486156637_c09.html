<a id="title82"/><h1 class="title-chapter"><span class="b">MONEY MENTAL</span></h1>
<p class="p">“Almost everyone seems to have had some kind of extrasensory experience that cannot be explained,” Milbourne Christopher observed. The magician who makes it appear that he can read the future or tune in on thought waves will always get an enthusiastic reaction from audiences. The tricks in this chapter center around psychic magic performed with coins and bills.</p>
<div class="section1"><a id="title83"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">73. DIVINATION</span></h1>
<p class="p">Three pairs of coins are hidden under three playing cards. The apparatus is mixed about. Although the coins are hidden under the cards, the magician succeeds in revealing where the various coins are.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> Ron Edwards developed this routine. Needed are three nickels, three pennies and three playing cards. The cards are a 2, a 6 and a 10. The cards must be secretly marked on the back. The 2 can be marked with one pencil dot, the 6 with two dots and the 10 with three dots.</p>
<p class="p-indent">To present the trick, put the coins down on the table in pairs, two nickels together, two pennies together in another pile and six cents (nickel plus penny) in a third pile.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Tell the spectator the 10-spot is to indicate the two nickels, the 2-spot the two pennies, and the 6-spot the penny-and-nickel combination. In other words, each card reflects the total of two coins.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Turn your back. Have the spectator mix around the pairs of coins, leaving them in the same combinations, but in different locations on the table. When he has done this, ask him to turn the playing cards face up and cover the three sets of coins. He is to place the 2-spot on the two-cent pile, the 6-spot on the six-cent pile and the 10-spot on the ten-cent pile.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Now tell him, “To confuse the situation further, shift the position of the three cards so the card values do not match up with any of the money combinations they cover.” When the spectator has done this, say, “And to add further confusion, please turn each card face down in place.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Turn around. Secretly spot the pencil dots so you know where the 6-spot is. Ask the spectator to hand you one of the coins from under it. If it is the penny, you know the two nickels are under the 2-spot and the six cents are under the 10-spot.</p>
<p class="p-indent">If the coin removed by the spectator is a nickel, you know the two pennies are under the 10-spot and the six cents are under the 2-spot. In either case, pretend to receive the necessary mental vibrations from the coin handed to you. Then reveal the whereabouts of the other coins.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title84"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">74. TIME WILL TELL</span></h1>
<p class="p">Twelve coins are arranged like a clock dial. A key is placed in the center, the top of the key pointing to the 12-o’clock position. The spectator turns over six coins randomly.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The magician, his back turned, has the spectator remove six coins and slide them to one side. It is found that the number of heads and tails showing on these six coins exactly matches the other six coins.</p>
<p class="p-indent">No questions are asked. The magician never knows which six coins were turned over by the spectator.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> This subtle trick was devised by Bob Hummer and Jack Yates. Arrange 12 coins to represent a clock dial. All coins are heads up. A key is placed in the center as in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c09.html#int_203" id="ref_int_203">Figure 201</a>, the top of the key pointing to the 12-o’clock position. A toothpick or other similarly shaped object may be used in place of the key. The key acts as a reference point so the 12-o’clock position is clearly marked.</p>
<div class="illustype_image"><div class="image"><img alt="e9780486156637_i0208.jpg" src="images/e9780486156637_i0208.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-c"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156637_c09.html#ref_int_203" id="int_203"><span class="b">Fig. 201</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">Turn your back. Have the spectator turn over any six coins in place. When he has finished, there will be six coins with heads showing, six with tails showing.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Ask the spectator to turn over the coins at positions 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 on the clock face. Explain that this further randomizes the distribution of heads and tails.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Then have him remove the coins at positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. These coins are slid away from the clock face without being turned over, and placed in a separate group on the table.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Say, “If I can tell psychic time correctly, I should have divided up the coins so that each group shows the same number of heads, and each group shows the same number of tails.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Turn and face the audience. Let the assisting spectator verify that you did indeed divide the coins into two equal groups of heads and tails.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The trick works just as described above. If you wish to disguise the principle, proceed as follows.</p>
<p class="p-indent">After the spectator has turned over six coins randomly, say to him, “Turn over the coin at position 1, the coin at position 10, the coins at positions 2 and 8 and the coins at positions 4 and 5.” Say this slowly, allowing the spectator time to suit his actions to your instructions.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When he has done this, say, “Now remove the coins at the position a quarter after nine [he would remove the coins at positions 3 and 9], the coins at position seven-thirty [he would remove the coins at positions 6 and 7] and the coins at position five to midnight [he would remove the coins at positions 11 and 12].”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Before telling him to remove the coins, make it clear he is to remove them by sliding them to another location on the table away from the clock face, and that he is not to turn them over.</p>
<p class="p-indent">If the above instruction is followed correctly, each group of six coins will have the same number of heads and tails showing. The routine can be done over the telephone.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title85"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">75. TAKE ONE</span></h1>
<p class="p">On the table are a quarter, a half-dollar and a silver dollar. Each of three spectators takes one of these coins and hides it in his hand. The magician’s back has been turned until this point.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The magician faces the three spectators and reveals who took which coin. No questions are asked. The trick may be repeated. This clever routine was originated by the British magician Al Koran.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> The first spectator is a confederate. The first time the trick is done, he takes the quarter. The second spectator takes either the half-dollar or the dollar. As soon as the confederate sees the second spectator’s choice, he proceeds as follows.</p>
<p class="p-indent">If the second spectator took the dollar, the confederate places his coin in his right hand. Otherwise he places his coin in his left hand.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The spectators are instructed to hide the coins by placing them behind their backs. Turn and face the second spectator. Out of the corner of your eye you can tell if the confederate’s right or left hand is behind his back. If his right hand is behind his back, the second spectator took the dollar. If this is the case, you would say to the second spectator, “I had a hunch you’d go for the big money. You chose the silver dollar.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Go on from here to reveal the coin held by the third spectator, then the coin held by the confederate.</p>
<p class="p-indent">If the trick is repeated, the confederate is to pick the half-dollar. The presentation is otherwise the same, i.e., if the second spectator chooses the dollar, the confederate places his own coin in his right hand. Otherwise he places the half-dollar in his left hand.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title86"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">76. DESTINY</span></h1>
<p class="p">Based on an idea of Vic Shoenk’s, this is an exceptional magic trick. Several coins are tossed onto the table. The spectator chooses any coin. He shuffles a deck of cards, then deals the cards into four rows on the table.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The date on the coin is noted. Say it is 1989. The four packets are turned over. The face cards have the numbers 1, 9, 8, 9, exactly matching the date on the chosen coin.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> A penny, nickel, dime and quarter are used. All four coins have the same date. Say this date is 1989. Place the coins in the left jacket pocket.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Remove an ace, 9, 8 and 9 from a deck of cards. Slide them under the clip of a pen and place the clipped packet face out in the upper handkerchief pocket of the jacket, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c09.html#int_204" id="ref_int_204">Figure 202</a>. This completes the preparation.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Hand the balance of the deck out for shuffling. When the spectator is satisfied the cards are well mixed, take back the deck in the right hand. Make sure the first and second fingers are at the front of the pack.</p>
<p class="p-indent">With the left hand remove the coins from the pocket and place them in the spectator’s hand. Tell him to mix the coins and choose one.</p>
<p class="p-indent">As he does this, bring the right hand to the outer handkerchief pocket and clip the pen between the right first and second fingers, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c09.html#int_205" id="ref_int_205">Figure 203</a>. Slide the pen and the clipped packet of cards upward and out of the pocket. The packet of four cards is thus added to the top of the deck.</p>

<p class="p-indent">With the left hand slide the pen free from the cards. Hand it to the spectator. Take back the three coins not chosen and return them to the pocket. Have the spectator jot down on a piece of paper the date on the chosen coin.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Hand the deck to the spectator. Ask him to deal it into four heaps. He can stop the deal at any time. He announces the date he chose. Then he turns up the four heaps to discover that the face cards match the chosen date.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title87"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">77. METALOGIC</span></h1>
<p class="p">“I have here some fine portraits of U.S. Presidents,” the performer says. As he talks, he places a penny, a nickel, a dime and a quarter on the table. “Washington is on the quarter, Roosevelt on the dime, Jefferson on the nickel and Lincoln on the penny,” the performer explains.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Turning his back, he says, “I’d like you to choose one of the coins. Hold it in your hand so you can see the portrait of the President. Cover the other three coins with a piece of paper.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">His back still turned, the magician now reveals which President the spectator is looking at. Nothing is written down. The magician may be blindfolded. The trick is impromptu and can be done at any time.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> This offbeat trick is based on a principle developed by Edward Bagshawe and Sam Schwartz. The present version was devised by the author. For the trick to work, all you need remember are the letters <span class="i">n-i-l,</span> in that order.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Place the four coins heads up on the table. Turn your back. Have the spectator choose a coin and place it heads up on his palm. Have him cover the other three coins.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Close your eyes and pretend to think psychic thoughts. Then say, “The President you are looking at—his name contains the letter <span class="i">n</span>.” If the spectator says no, reply, “I meant that his first name, Franklin, contains two n’s. He’s a modern-day President. Roosevelt, correct?” You will be correct.</p>
<p class="p-indent">If the spectator says yes to <span class="i">n</span>, say, “There’s also an <span class="i">i</span>.” If the spectator says no, reply, “I meant that you see only one eye because he’s in profile. It’s President Jefferson, correct?” You will be correct.</p>
<p class="p-indent">If the spectator says yes to <span class="i">i</span>, say, “I see what looks like an <span class="i">l.”</span> If the spectator says no to <span class="i">l,</span> reply, “Now that I think of it, that <span class="i">l</span> is really the number one, which stands for our first President, George Washington, correct?” You will be correct.</p>
<p class="p-indent">If the spectator says yes to <span class="i">l</span>, say, “The letters <span class="i">n, i, l</span> are really the first three letters of his name in reverse order. That should be <span class="i">L-i-n</span> for Lincoln, correct?” You will be correct.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Note that, in the above series of statements, as soon as you get your first no answer, you know the name of the chosen President.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title88"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">78. IMMOVABLE OBJECT</span></h1>
<p class="p">While the magician turns his back, a spectator drops a coin into any one of six numbered glasses, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c09.html#int_206" id="ref_int_206">Figure 204</a>. At the magician’s direction the spectator moves the coin from glass to glass. The glasses are eliminated one at a time until only one glass remains. Remarkably, it is the glass that contains the coin, and the number on the glass matches a previously written prediction.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_text"><div class="image_text"><img alt="e9780486156637_i0211.jpg" src="images/e9780486156637_i0211.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-c"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156637_c09.html#ref_int_206" id="int_206"><span class="b">Fig. 204</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">This brilliant trick is based on ideas of Bob Hummer, Stewart James and Mel Stover. The magician can be in the next room. There are no gimmicks or confederates. The magician never knows the location of the coin until the very end, yet the prediction is always correct.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> Use six numbered glasses like those shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c09.html#int_206">Figure 204</a>. The glasses can be numbered by placing adhesive labels on them and numbering the labels. On a piece of paper write, “No matter what you do, Fate has decreed the coin will end up in glass No. 5.” Fold the paper and place it in plain view on the table.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Turn your back or leave the room. Ask the spectator to place the coin in any glass. When he has done so, ask him to note the number of the glass and to make that number of moves. A move consists of pouring the coin from its glass into an adjacent glass.</p>
<p class="p-indent">If the coin is in glass No. 3 at the start, for example, the spectator would make three moves. If the coin is in glass No. 6 at the start, the spectator would make six moves.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When he has done this, ask him to remove glass No. 1.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Have him make one move. Then ask him to remove glass No. 6.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Have the spectator make four moves. Then tell him to remove glass No. 2.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Let him make three moves. Then have him remove glass No. 3.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Finally, have him make three more moves and remove glass No. 4.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The coin will be in glass No. 5, matching the prediction exactly.</p></div></div>
