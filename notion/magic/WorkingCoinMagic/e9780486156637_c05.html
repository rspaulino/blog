<a id="title54"/><h1 class="title-chapter"><span class="b">AT THE TABLE</span></h1>
<p class="p">After dinner, people are in a relaxed frame of mind, an ideal time for the performance of a few tricks with coins. The tricks in this chapter are particularly suited to being performed in the atmosphere that exists after the dessert dishes have been cleared away and people are in the mood to be entertained.</p>
<div class="section1"><a id="title55"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">49. NIMBLE NICKELS</span></h1>
<p class="p">Ten nickels are placed on the table in two rows. Five of the coins are gathered in one hand, five in the other. One nickel is visibly transferred from the right hand to the left hand. Instantly, all ten nickels end up in the left hand.</p>
<p class="p-indent">This amazing trick was devised by David Devant and Dai Vernon.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> Any even number of similar coins can be used. If foreign coins are available, they will lend an exotic air to the trick.</p>
<p class="p-indent">For this discussion we will assume ten nickels are used. Arrange them on the table in two vertical rows, five coins in each row. The rows should be 6″-8″ apart.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Tell the audience that, with the new math, people may have forgotten how easy counting was in the old days. Grasp the two coins nearest you, one in each hand, between thumb and first finger. Turn the hands palm up. Close the fingers, but allow the coins to rest on the fingers, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c05.html#int_98" id="ref_int_98">Figure 96</a>. Say, “One and one.”</p>

<p class="p-indent">In a quick motion bring the hands together and simultaneously turn them palm down. Let the coins fall to the table, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c05.html#int_99" id="ref_int_99">Figure 97</a>. Say, “One and one is two.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Pick up the coins, one in each hand, keeping the fingers closed into fists. Let the coins rest momentarily on top of the fists, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c05.html#int_100" id="ref_int_100">Figure 98</a>. Then open the fists slightly, allowing the coins to fall into the fists.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Grasp the next pair of coins in the hands as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c05.html#int_98">Figure 96</a>. Turn the hands palm down in a quick motion as before, with the hands being momentarily brought together. But this time open the left fingers just enough to catch secretly the coin that rests on the fingers. At the same time, open the right fingers enough to allow the coin in the right fist to fall to the table.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The result is as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c05.html#int_99">Figure 97</a>. The audience sees two coins fall to the table. The spectators are unaware both coins came from the right hand.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Pick up these two coins on top of the fists, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c05.html#int_100">Figure 98</a>. Allow the coins to sink into the clenched fists. The audience thinks each hand holds two coins. Actually, the left hand holds three coins, the right hand just one. As the above sequence is performed, say, “And two more coins make four.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Perform exactly the same actions with the third, fourth and fifth pairs of coins. As you do, say, “Two more make six.” “Two more make eight.” “Two more make ten.” At this point, with all coins gathered in the fists, you will have nine coins in the left hand and one in the right.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Say, “Of course when you get to ten, you have to remember to carry the one.” As you say this, tip the right fist over onto the left, so the single coin in the right fist can be dropped onto the left fist, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c05.html#int_101" id="ref_int_101">Figure 99</a>. Allow the coin to slip into the closed left hand.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Say, “Ten is made from a zero and a one. We have zero over here.” Open the right hand to show it empty. “And ten over here.” Open the left hand, allowing the ten coins to pour out onto the table.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title56"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">50. TWIST</span></h1>
<p class="p">A coin is wrapped in a handkerchief. The spectator pulls the ends of the handkerchief. The coin vanishes. The handkerchief is waved over a saltshaker. The spectator lifts the saltshaker and finds the missing coin under it.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> Required are an opaque handkerchief, a quarter and a duplicate quarter. Beforehand, secretly place the quarter under a saltshaker or other object on the table.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Spread the handkerchief out flat on the table. Place the other quarter in the center, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c05.html#int_102" id="ref_int_102">Figure 100</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Fold the bottom half up, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c05.html#int_103" id="ref_int_103">Figure 101</a>. Fold the right half over to the left, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c05.html#int_104" id="ref_int_104">Figure 102</a>.

<p class="p-indent">Explain and pantomime with the hands that he is to lift the handkerchief off the table and pull the ends sharply apart. When this is done by the spectator it will appear that the coin has vanished. Actually, the coin is trapped inside the center of the handkerchief, as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c05.html#int_107" id="ref_int_107">Figure 105</a>.</p>

<p class="p-indent">Grasp the coin through the cloth at the point marked by the arrow shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c05.html#int_107">Figure 105</a>. Taking the handkerchief from the spectator, wave it over the saltshaker.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Let the spectator lift the saltshaker to reveal the coin. Place the handkerchief, with the concealed coin, in the pocket.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title57"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">51. PENNY ANTE</span></h1>
<p class="p">Two pennies placed on the table are covered with the hands. On command, both pennies end up under the same hand.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> To perform this trick, the palms of the hands should be moist. Place two pennies on the table about 12” apart. Cover the coins with the hands, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c05.html#int_108" id="ref_int_108">Figure 106</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Lift the hands and cross them, left over right, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c05.html#int_109" id="ref_int_109">Figure 107</a>. Shake your head as if conditions are not quite right. Draw the hands away and make some minor adjustment to the coins.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Cover the coins as in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c05.html#int_108">Figure 106</a>. Then cross the hands, left over right, and cover the coins as in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c05.html#int_109">Figure 107</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Press firmly on the coin under the right hand so the coin adheres to the palm. Begin to uncross the hands but let the left hand move faster than the right so the left hand is over the right just as the right hand lifts away from the table, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c05.html#int_110" id="ref_int_110">Figure 108</a>. This conceals the fact that the coin on the left is being stolen under the right hand.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Bring the hands back to the position shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c05.html#int_108">Figure 106</a>. Lift the left hand to reveal that its coin has vanished. Then lift the right hand to show both coins.</p>
<p class="p-indent">As a variation, you can have a dime and penny on the left, a dime on the right. Perform the above trick, but steal the dime on the left, leaving the penny. The result is that both dimes end up on the right.</p>

<p class="p">Three coins are placed in a triangular layout as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c05.html#int_111" id="ref_int_111">Figure 109</a>. Two of the coins are covered with playing cards. One coin vanishes from under its card and appears under the other card.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> The routine is based on an idea of Jacob Daley’s. Place three quarters in the layout shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c05.html#int_111">Figure 109</a>. The trick should be done on a table covered with a tablecloth.</p>

<p class="p-indent">Take a playing card in each hand. Cover the coin at <span class="i">A</span> with the card in the left hand. At the same time cover the coin at <span class="i">C</span> with the card in the right hand.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Shake your head. Say, “No, I don’t feel a psychic connection between these two coins.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Cover the coin at <span class="i">B</span> with the card in the left hand. At the same time, cover the coin at <span class="i">C</span> with the card in the right hand. Again shake your head and say, “Still no connection.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">The right-hand card is now placed at position <span class="i">B.</span> The left hand moves its card forward to position <span class="i">A</span>. But as it does so, the back of the left hand contacts the coin at <span class="i">B</span> and secretly slides it up to position <span class="i">A.</span> An exposed view of the sliding action is shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c05.html#int_112" id="ref_int_112">Figure 110</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The hands are now in the position shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c05.html#int_113" id="ref_int_113">Figure 111</a>. Release the cards.

<p class="p-indent">Snap the fingers. Pick up the card at <span class="i">B</span> to show that the coin has vanished. Pick up the card at position A to reveal all three coins.</p>

<p class="p">“There are several magicians living in this building,” the magician says. “Sometimes we’ll do a trick together. I’ll throw a coin invisibly to the fellow upstairs. His friend downstairs will toss it back.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">So saying, the magician wraps a coin in a handkerchief. He tosses it toward the ceiling. The coin vanishes. The magician downstairs gets the coin on the relay and tosses it back. The coin is heard to rattle around on the floor at the spectator’s feet.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> Two identical coins are used. While seated at the table, secretly place one coin on the edge of the knee. Raise the heel so your foot rests on the toe.

<p class="p">At the same time, with a sharp motion, extend the hands so the handkerchief is pulled taut, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c05.html#int_119" id="ref_int_119">Figure 117</a>. Raise the hands upward as they are pulled apart, and look toward the ceiling as if following the flight of the coin. Actually, the coin is trapped in a fold of the handkerchief.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Drop your gaze to the floor. At the same time lower the heel to the floor, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c05.html#int_115">Figure 113</a>. The coin on the knee will clatter to the floor, apparently having completed its invisible round-trip. As the spectators look for the coin that has just rolled to the floor, lower the handkerchief to the table. Fold it up and place it in the pocket to get rid of the duplicate coin.</p>
<p class="p-indent">If you find that the coin does not remain concealed inside the handkerchief in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c05.html#int_119">Figure 117</a>, there is a surefire alternate method. Roll a small piece of transparent tape into a cylinder with the sticky or adhesive side outward, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c05.html#int_120" id="ref_int_120">Figure 117-A</a>. Place this piece of tape in the center of the handkerchief. This completes the preparation.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When performing the trick, spread the handkerchief out on the table with the tape side up. Place a coin on the center of the handkerchief as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c05.html#int_116">Figure 114</a>. The coin is placed directly onto the tape.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Proceed with the trick as written. When you reach the point illustrated in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c05.html#int_119">Figure 117</a>, the coin will remain hidden inside the handkerchief because it adheres to the tape.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Home-improvement stores sell transparent tape that has adhesive on both sides. Carpet tape also has adhesive on both sides. If you find that the tape shows up on a white handkerchief, use a handkerchief with an allover pattern to conceal the tape.</p></div>

<p class="p">Yank Ho invented a coin trick in which coins placed in a square layout magically gather together. The following is a simplified handling of this classic plot.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> Required are two playing cards and four similar coins. Assume the coins are half-dollars. Place the coins in a layout measuring 8” square. Each hand holds a playing card between the first and second finger. The starting position is shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c05.html#int_121" id="ref_int_121">Figure 118</a>.</p>

<p class="p-indent">Remark that coins sometimes act in sympathy with one another. As you speak, cover the coin at <span class="i">A</span> with the left-hand card, the coin at <span class="i">D</span> with the right-hand card.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Then cover the coin at <span class="i">C</span> with the left-hand card; the coin at <span class="i">B</span> with the right-hand card.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The secret maneuver comes into play here. Cover the coin at <span class="i">A</span> with the left-hand card, the coin at <span class="i">C</span> with the right-hand card. Make sure the right first finger, under the card, rests at the right edge of the coin at <span class="i">C.</span></p>
<p class="p-indent">Slide the left-hand card to a position under the coin at <span class="i">C,</span> Figure 119. This will raise the coin off the table, allowing the coin to be clipped secretly by the right first finger. The right first finger presses the coin against the card held by the right hand. This maneuver was devised by James Drilling.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The left hand leaves its card at <span class="i">C.</span> The right hand places its card at position <span class="i">A,</span> <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c05.html#int_122" id="ref_int_122">Figure 120</a>. When placing the right-hand card on the table, be sure the hidden coin does not clink against the coin already at <span class="i">A.</span></p>
<p class="p-indent">Say, “You’ve heard the expression that birds of a feather flock together. Here’s what that means.” Take the coin at <span class="i">B</span> in the right hand. Place the right hand under the table.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Clink the right hand’s coin against the underside of the table. Lift the card at <span class="i">A</span> to show two coins. One coin apparently penetrated up through the table to join the coin at <span class="i">A.</span></p>

<p class="p-indent">Pick up the two coins at <span class="i">A</span> with the left hand. Bring the palm-up right hand to a position just below the near edge of the tabletop. Drop the two coins from the left hand into the right hand.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Bring the right hand into view. It is cupped so the audience cannot get a clear view of the coins. Drop all three coins from the right hand to the left hand.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Place the left hand palm down at <span class="i">B.</span> The right hand takes the coin at <span class="i">D</span> and places it under the table.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The right hand taps its coin against the underside of the tabletop. At the same time, the left hand opens so its three coins drop into view. Apparently another coin has penetrated the table.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The palm-up right hand moves to a position just below the edge of the tabletop. The left hand drops its three coins into the right hand.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Close the right hand into a fist. Place it palm down at <span class="i">D.</span> Tap the card at <span class="i">C</span> with the left hand. Turn up this card to show that the last coin has vanished.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Open the right hand to reveal all four coins.</p>
<p class="p-indent">In working the routine, if you find you have trouble keeping two coins concealed under the card at the position shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c05.html#int_122">Figure 120</a>, you can use cardboard squares measuring 3” on a side or larger.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title61"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">55. DUET</span></h1>
<p class="p">Coins of different denominations are wrapped in a handkerchief. The spectator is asked to name one. The named coin penetrates the tabletop, leaving the other coin wrapped in the handkerchief.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> This routine is based on a means of secretly transferring a coin from inside the handkerchief to the lap. John V. Hope and Robert Olsen devised a brilliant method that requires no sleight of hand.</p>
<p class="p-indent">You may wish to drape a napkin over the lap to keep the coin from falling to the floor. Also, it may be necessary to sit so that the toes touch the floor but the heels are raised. This tends to raise the knees and will keep the coin from falling or rolling off.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Spread a handkerchief out flat on the table so one corner is over the near edge of the table. Place a nickel and a half-dollar on the center of the handkerchief. The half-dollar is toward you. The position is shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c05.html#int_123" id="ref_int_123">Figure 121</a>.</p>

<p class="p-indent">The far corner, marked X in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c05.html#int_123">Figure 121</a>, is brought down and over the coins so this corner is just at the near edge of the table. The right hand grasps the nickel through the handkerchief.</p>
<p class="p-indent">As the handkerchief is raised off the table, the half-dollar will slide out and into the lap as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c05.html#int_124" id="ref_int_124">Figure 122</a>. The folds of the handkerchief cover the movement of the coin. Make sure the near edge of the handkerchief is not lifted from the table until the coin slides into the lap.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Turn the left hand palm up and grasp the handkerchief just above the coins as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c05.html#int_125" id="ref_int_125">Figure 123</a>. Show the right hand empty. Place it below the table. When it is out of sight, the right hand grasps the half-dollar and brings it to a position under the table.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Ask the spectator, “Which coin would you like to have?” Nine times out of ten, he will name the half-dollar. Bring the handkerchief down so the center touches the table. At the same time, rap the half-dollar against the underside of the table. Then bring the half-dollar into view and toss it onto the table. Allow the spectator to open the handkerchief to reveal the other coin.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Should the spectator name the nickel, reply, “Then that leaves the half-dollar for me.” Cause the half-dollar to penetrate the tabletop as described above. Hand the handkerchief to the spectator and have him discover that the nickel remains inside.</p></div></div>
