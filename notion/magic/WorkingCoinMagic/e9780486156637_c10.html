<a id="title89"/><h1 class="title-chapter"><span class="b">A LESSON IN TIMING</span></h1>
<p class="p">Jean Hugard once wrote that “The fundamental basis of magic with coins is the art of palming, that is, of holding and concealing a coin or several coins, in the palm of one hand, while pretending to place them in the other.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Because palming is fundamental to money magic, a book on the subject would not be complete without mention of palming. Coin expert Bill Wisch has developed a nearly self-working method of mastering the classic palm using the technique of timing. If you follow the Bill Wisch instructions given here, and if you can count to three, you can perform a deceptive classic palm the first time you try it.</p>
<div class="section1"><a id="title90"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">79. EASY AS 1, 2, 3</span></h1>
<p class="p">The Bill Wisch technique uses a system of beats to perform the palm. The idea is to tap the foot rhythmically to establish the beats. Use a slow rhythm when learning the move. Gradually increase the tempo to a point where it feels comfortable and looks natural.</p>
<p class="p-indent">In this first sequence, the coin will actually be transferred from the left hand to the right. This is to establish the way the handling would look if the coin was actually transferred from hand to hand. A dollar bill folded in eighths may be used in place of a coin. Some people may find this easier because the sharp edges of a folded bill make it easy to grip.</p>
<p class="p-indent">On the count of one, the coin is in the position shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c10.html#int_207" id="ref_int_207">Figure 205</a>. The right hand is palm up. The coin rests on the right palm. The left first finger points to the coin. The tip of the left first finger contacts the coin.</p>
<p class="p-indent">On the count of two, the hands have moved to the position shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c10.html#int_208" id="ref_int_208">Figure 206</a>. The coin has been dropped into the left palm. The edge of the right hand touches the base of the left fingers.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The count of three is shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c10.html#int_209" id="ref_int_209">Figure 207</a>. The left fingers have closed around the coin and the right hand has been lifted out of the way. This completes the basic action. Remember to maintain a steady tempo. On the counts of one, two, three, you will arrive at, respectively, the positions shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c10.html#int_207">Figures 205</a>, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c10.html#int_208">206</a>, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c10.html#int_209">207</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When performing the classic palm, the hands should appear to go through the same actions. On the count of one, the coin is in the position shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c10.html#int_207">Figure 205</a>. To check that the position is correct, if you move the right thumb slightly to the left, the coin will be gripped between the base of the thumb and the palm, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c10.html#int_210" id="ref_int_210">Figure 208</a>. The right fingers do not move. With the coin gripped as in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c10.html#int_210">Figure 208</a>, you should be able to turn the hand palm down and retain the coin in position. The left first finger can aid by pushing the coin down into the right palm in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c10.html#int_207">Figure 205</a>.</p>

<p class="p-indent">On the count of two, the hands have reached the position of <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c10.html#int_211" id="ref_int_211">Figure 209</a>. The coin is gripped in classic palm position in the right hand. The back of the right hand is toward the spectators, concealing the true situation from audience view.</p>
<p class="p-indent">On the count of three, the left fingers close and the right hand moves to the position of <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c10.html#int_209">Figure 207</a>. This completes the pretended placement of the coin into the left hand.</p>
<p class="p-indent">If you wish to show that the coin has vanished, on the count of four you can open the left hand to show the hand empty.</p>
<p class="p-indent">If you have trouble gripping the coin as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c10.html#int_210">Figure 208</a>, the coin may be the wrong size. Try palming with a larger or smaller coin or with a folded dollar bill. If the hands are dry, the coin will slip; use a hand lotion to moisten the hands.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title91"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">80. COIN THRU TABLE</span></h1>
<p class="p">This is an application of the Bill Wisch classic palm in which a borrowed coin penetrates the table.</p>
<p class="p-indent">On the count of one, display the coin as in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c10.html#int_207">Figure 205</a>. On the count of two, pretend to drop the coin into the left palm, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c10.html#int_211">Figure 209</a>. On the count of three, close the left hand and bring the right hand to the position shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c10.html#int_209">Figure 207</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Place the closed left hand palm down on the tabletop. At the same time, place the right hand palm down on the right leg. Leave the palmed coin on the leg.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Raise the right hand. With the palm toward the audience, snap the fingers. Say, “It’s important to do that or the trick won’t work.” The audience has a chance to see that the right hand is empty.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Bring the right hand under the table. Pick up the coin with the right fingers. Rap the left fist against the table once or twice. Then open the hand and slap it palm down against the table.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Turn the left hand palm up to show that the coin has vanished. At the same time, bring the right hand up into view, displaying the coin at the fingertips.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Any small, easily palmed object, such as a book of matches, may be used in place of the coin.</p></div></div>
