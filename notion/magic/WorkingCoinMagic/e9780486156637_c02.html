<p class="p">Amateur and professional magicians agree on the value of good stand-up tricks for their acts. Tricks that are performed while standing can be seen by the maximum number of spectators. Also, such tricks require nothing in the way of tables or special settings. Armed with nothing more than a few simple props, the stand-up magician can step before the audience and immediately proceed to perform miracles.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Almost all of the tricks in this chapter use props that may be borrowed. Some, like “Penny-tration” (No. 11), can be done close up. Others, like “Hot Silver” (No. 14), are ideal for platform or stage acts.</p>
<div class="section1"><a id="title12"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">9. SLAP COIN</span></h1>
<p class="p">Bob Hummer invented a quick trick that produces startling visual magic. The magician places a coin in the left hand. The left hand is closed into a fist.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The right hand is slapped on top of the left fist. When the right hand is lifted, the coin is on top of the left fist, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c02.html#int_24" id="ref_int_24">Figure 23</a>, having apparently penetrated the fist.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> Flip a coin in the air and catch it in the left palm. Close the left hand into a loose fist and turn the left hand palm down.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Slap the top of the left fist with the right hand, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c02.html#int_25" id="ref_int_25">Figure 24</a>. As you do, move both hands up. At the same time release the coin.</p>

<p class="p-indent">The coin will sail out of the left fist as shown by the arrow in the exposed view in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c02.html#int_26" id="ref_int_26">Figure 25</a>. It will bounce off the right palm and come to rest on top of the left hand.</p>
<p class="p-indent">There is a knack to making the motion. The left hand should move up and stop abruptly. Allow the coin to keep moving so it sails out of the left hand, ricochets off the right palm and comes to rest on top of the left fist. All that remains is to lift the right hand away to show that the coin has apparently penetrated the left hand.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Practice the motion so it is imperceptible. When you have mastered it, you may wish to try a variation suggested by Bruce Elliott. Drop a handful of change into the left hand. Close the hand into a fist. Keep jingling the coins. As the right hand moves to a position over the left fist, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c02.html#int_25">Figure 24</a>, the motion of the left hand is used to work the coins to a position near the opening in the fist.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Use the maneuver shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c02.html#int_26">Figure 25</a> to propel the coins out of the fist, against the right palm and onto the top of the left fist. Freeze the hands. Then slowly draw the right hand away to show the coins on top of the left hand.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title13"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">10. MONEY MAKES MONEY</span></h1>
<p class="p">“You’ve heard the saying that money makes money,” the magician says. “Let me show you what that means.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">He displays a dollar bill, folds it, snaps his fingers and causes a half-dollar to materialize from within the bill.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> Have the bill and a half-dollar in the pocket. Reach into the pocket, place the coin behind the bill, then remove the apparatus so the bill faces the audience with the coin concealed in back.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Snap the left side of the bill with the left fingers, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c02.html#int_27" id="ref_int_27">Figure 26</a>. This shows the left hand empty and also indicates that the left side of the bill does not conceal a coin.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Grasp the left side of the bill with the left hand. Then transfer the coin from the right to the left hand as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c02.html#int_28" id="ref_int_28">Figure 27</a>. This clever move was invented by Clayton Rosencrance.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When the coin has been secretly transferred to a position under the left thumb, snap the right side of the bill with the right first finger, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c02.html#int_29" id="ref_int_29">Figure 28</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Fold the bill into quarters with the coin inside. Then tilt the folded bill downward so the coin slowly emerges from inside the bill, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c02.html#int_30" id="ref_int_30">Figure 29</a>.</p>

<div class="section1"><a id="title14"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">11. PENNY-TRATION</span></h1>
<p class="p">A spectator is given seven pennies to hold. The magician causes one penny to penetrate the spectator’s hand. This fine trick was invented by Harry Baker.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> The seven pennies can be borrowed. There are no extra pennies and no gimmicks. The trick depends on timing for its success.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Hold the pennies cupped in the left hand. Stand facing the spectator. Have him hold his right hand palm up. Pour the pennies into his hand. Have him count them one at a time back into your hand. He should count them aloud. This impresses on the spectator’s mind that there are exactly seven pennies.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Again, have the spectator hold his hand palm up. Explain that you are going to count the pennies into his hand one at a time, and that when you have counted the seventh coin, he is to clench his hand into a tight fist quickly to trap the coins.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Use your right hand to pick up the first coin. Place it into the spectator’s hand on the count of one, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c02.html#int_31" id="ref_int_31">Figure 30</a>. After you have placed the first coin in his hand, allow each succeeding coin to click against a coin in the spectator’s hand.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_net"><div class="image_net"><img alt="e9780486156637_i0035.jpg" src="images/e9780486156637_i0035.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-d"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156637_c02.html#ref_int_31" id="int_31"><span class="b">Fig. 30</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">After five pennies have been placed in the spectator’s hand, his eyes and ears are conditioned by the motion and sound. When you pick up the sixth coin, simply click it against a coin in the spectator’s hand. Do not let go of it. Click it against one of the coins in his hand and bring the coin right back out again, still gripped between the right thumb and first finger. Keep the back of the hand toward the spectator to conceal the penny from view.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The last penny is tossed from your left hand into the spectator’s hand. He closes his fist. Keep the back of the right hand to the spectator. Bring the right hand under the spectator’s closed hand. Slap your hand against the back of his hand. Then bring your hand out, showing the penny. It appears that one penny penetrated his hand.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title15"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">12. IMPROMPTU BILL VANISH</span></h1>
<p class="p">A borrowed $5 bill is rolled up and placed into the spectator’s hand. When he opens his hand, the bill has vanished. It is found in the magician’s pocket.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> Tightly roll a borrowed $5 bill into a cylinder. Stand so the spectator is on your left. Hold the bill in the right hand. The edge of the bill contacts the first finger. This keeps the bill from unraveling.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Have the spectator hold his right hand palm up. Grasp his right wrist with your left hand.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Raise the bill in the direction of the arrow in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c02.html#int_32" id="ref_int_32">Figure 31</a>. Then bring it down so it strikes the spectator’s palm. Instruct him that on the count of three he is to close his hand quickly around the bill.</p>

<p class="p-indent">Swing your hand in an arc, first up, then down so the bill strikes the spectator’s palm. Count “one” as the bill hits his palm; Repeat the move and count “two” as the bill again hits the spectator’s palm; Each time move the hand in an upward arc using a relaxed motion. The hand goes to the right of the face as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c02.html#int_33" id="ref_int_33">Figure 32</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">As you perform the motion the third time, bring the bill up to the ear and leave the bill behind the ear, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c02.html#int_34" id="ref_int_34">Figure 33</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Without hesitating, bring the right hand down; The extended first finger strikes the spectator’s palm as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c02.html#int_34">Figure 33</a>. The spectator closes his hand around your finger.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Move you fingers in the direction of the spectator’s jacket sleeve as if tossing the bill into the sleeve. The spectator opens his hand and discovers the bill is gone. He will probably look in his sleeve for the missing money. This trick was suggested by Gaylord Hill.</p>
<p class="p-indent">You can turn to your right and retrieve the bill from behind the ear. Another approach is to have a duplicate $5 bill rolled in a cylinder and kept in the pocket. Produce this bill and hand it back to the spectator.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title16"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">13. CRASH GLASS</span></h1>
<p class="p">A borrowed coin is tapped against the bottom of a borrowed glass. The coin visibly penetrates the glass and ends up inside the glass.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> This amazing trick was devised by the Canadian magician Ross Bertram. Hold the glass in the left hand. The mouth of the glass is against the palm. The glass is gripped by the thumb and little finger. The remaining fingers can be moved without disturbing the grip on the glass.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Borrow a coin. Take it with the right hand. Tap it against the bottom of the glass, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c02.html#int_35" id="ref_int_35">Figure 34</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Separate the hands. The hands are then brought together in a quick motion. Unknown to the audience, the coin is thrown so it is caught by the extended left fingers, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c02.html#int_36" id="ref_int_36">Figure 35</a>. The right hand should be slightly in front of the left. The coin will travel in front of the glass.</p>
<p class="p-indent">As soon as the coin is caught, move the left hand sharply to the left, then back to the right. In this action the coin is allowed to enter the glass. The right palm contacts the bottom of the glass. The result is the situation shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c02.html#int_37" id="ref_int_37">Figure 36</a>. When the trick is properly performed, the coin travels too quickly for it to be followed by the eye.</p>

<div class="section1"><a id="title17"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">14. HOT SILVER</span></h1>
<p class="p">Needed are two handkerchiefs, a paper bag and a borrowed coin. One handkerchief is folded and placed in the paper bag. The borrowed coin is marked and placed inside the other handkerchief. It vanishes at the snap of the fingers.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The magician reaches into the paper bag, removes the other handkerchief, gives it a shake and the coin tumbles into view.</p>
<p class="p-indent">This beautiful routine stems from ideas of John V. Hope and Robert Olsen.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> The handkerchiefs may be kept folded in the paper bag until you are ready to perform the routine. Have the spectator remove the handkerchiefs, unfold them and hand one to you. This indicates to the audience that there are no gimmicks or extra coins.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Borrow a coin and have it marked. While this is done, have the spectator fold his handkerchief and return it to the bag.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Drape the other handkerchief over the left hand. Grasp the coin through the fabric. Display it as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c02.html#int_38" id="ref_int_38">Figure 37</a>. The left side should be toward the audience.</p>

<p class="p-indent">As the right hand drapes the handkerchief over the coin, the right jacket sleeve moves to a position near the coin. With no change in pace, drop the coin into the right sleeve, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c02.html#int_39" id="ref_int_39">Figure 38</a>. The back of the left hand should be toward the audience at this point. The handkerchief covers the sleeving of the coin as shown in the audience’s view, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c02.html#int_40" id="ref_int_40">Figure 39</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When the end of the handkerchief has been draped over the left hand, release the right hand. Then grasp the center of the handkerchief with the right hand, as if grasping the coin through the fabric. Bring the left hand out from under the handkerchief and grasp the center of the handkerchief.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Raise the right hand. The palm of the right hand should be toward the audience with the fingers widespread to show the right hand unmistakably empty. Snap the right fingers.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Grasp one corner of the handkerchief with the right hand. Shake the handkerchief to show that the coin has vanished.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Pretend to drop the handkerchief to the floor accidentally. The next maneuver subtly demonstrates that the coin is not in the sleeve. When you raised the right hand to snap the fingers, the coin slid to a position near the elbow. Kneel to pick up the handkerchief, placing the elbow against the right knee, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c02.html#int_41" id="ref_int_41">Figure 40</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">With the elbow pressed against the knee, reach down with the right hand to take the handkerchief, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c02.html#int_42" id="ref_int_42">Figure 41</a>. The coin is trapped and cannot move. Reverse the above procedure as you stand up.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Hand the handkerchief to the spectator. Show both hands empty. Reach into the bag with the right hand. Allow the coin to slide out of the sleeve. Catch it with the right hand while the hand is inside the bag. If you miss the coin, it will fall noiselessly onto the folded handkerchief.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Grasp the coin with the curled fingers. Remove the handkerchief from the bag. Give the handkerchief a shake. Release the coin, allowing it to fall to the table. Let the spectator verify the mark.</p>

<p class="p-indent">The right hand picks up a pen that has a clip. The pen is pushed into the left fist, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c02.html#int_43" id="ref_int_43">Figure 42</a>, so that the coin is secretly engaged in the clip.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The pen is grasped between the first and second fingers of the right hand, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c02.html#int_44" id="ref_int_44">Figure 43</a>, and pulled out of the left hand. The back of the right hand screens the stolen coin from audience view.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Open the left hand to show that the coin has vanished. Then close the left hand into a fist. Push the pen into the fist, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c02.html#int_45" id="ref_int_45">Figure 44</a>, allowing the coin to slide free of the clip. Remove the pen and wave it over the left hand. Open the left hand to show that the coin has returned.</p></div>

<p class="p"><span class="i">Method</span>: Hold the inside of the jacket handkerchief pocket open with a wadded piece of cloth. A small handkerchief may be used if it is not too bulky. When no one is looking, place a half-dollar on top of the head.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Remove another half-dollar from the pocket. Place it on the eye as if it were a monocle. Say something like, “Here’s how I keep an eye on my money.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Turn around slowly. When your back is to the spectator, allow the coin to drop into the handkerchief pocket, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c02.html#int_46" id="ref_int_46">Figure 45</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Continue turning until you face the audience again. Say, “Of course my money has a mind of its own.” Slowly reach up to the top of the head and remove the duplicate coin.</p></div></div>
