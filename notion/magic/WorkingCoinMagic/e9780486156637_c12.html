<a id="title99"/><h1 class="title-chapter"><span class="b">PLATFORM TRICKS</span></h1>
<p class="p">Coins and bills are used in every type of show, whether it be a close-up performance or a platform act. The tricks in this chapter have been used by professional magicians for the entertainment of audiences large and small. The chapter closes with a trick that uses the book you are now reading.</p>
<div class="section1"><a id="title100"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">87. THE MISER’S DREAM</span></h1>
<p class="p">The trick in which the magician plucks a seemingly endless number of coins from thin air was known as “The Ariel Treasury” in Robert Houdin’s time. As a feature trick in the stage act of T. Nelson Downs, it gained great popularity. The following is one of the simplest methods of performing this classic feat.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> Use a kraft paper bag that measures about 4″ × 7″ on the bottom and is about 12” in height. These dimensions are not crucial. You want a paper bag that can be easily handled.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Fold back the rim about 2”. Place the bag mouth down on the table. Put three half-dollars into the folded portion, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c12.html#int_241" id="ref_int_241">Figure 238</a>.</p>
<div class="illustype_image"><div class="image"><img alt="e9780486156637_i0246.jpg" src="images/e9780486156637_i0246.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-c"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156637_c12.html#ref_int_241" id="int_241"><span class="b">Fig. 238</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p">The bag is kept in this condition until the performance. The coins are at the back of the bag and are thus concealed from audience view.</p>
<p class="p-indent">To perform the trick, grasp the bag from above with the palm-down right hand. Lift the bag off the table. Then grasp the rim of the bag at the back where the coins are, using the palm-up left hand. The left thumb keeps the coins in place. Turn the bag mouth up.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Look into the air above your head as if searching for an invisible coin floating in the air. Rest the bottom of the bag on the palm-up right hand. Silently release one coin by easing pressure and allowing the coin to drop. The coin falls into the right palm, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c12.html#int_242" id="ref_int_242">Figure 239</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Reach into the air with the right hand. Push the coin to the fingertips as you do this so it appears you have plucked a coin from the air. Display the coin and drop it into the bag.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Rattle the bag with the left hand. Rest the bag on the right palm, but do not release another coin. Look to the right, then to the left. As you do this, place the left third finger over on top of the second finger, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c12.html#int_243" id="ref_int_243">Figure 240</a>. This action is hidden because the left hand is inside the bag.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When you look to the left, do a double take and look back to the right. Extend the bag in the air as if to catch another coin. As you do, release the left third finger by snapping it against the bag. This will produce a sharp sound as if another coin fell into the bag.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Place the bag on the right palm. Peer down into the bag as if you yourself are amazed that another coin appeared from nowhere. As you do this, allow another coin to fall into the right palm as in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c12.html#int_242">Figure 239</a>.</p>

<p class="p-indent">Produce this coin as you did the first one. Drop it into the bag. Then repeat the action shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c12.html#int_243">Figure 240</a>. Pantomime catching another coin by the action of extending the bag and making the snapping sound with the finger.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Finally, release the last coin as in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c12.html#int_242">Figure 239</a>. Produce it at the fingertips and drop it into the bag.</p>
<p class="p-indent">If you find the pocket is loose and does not retain the coins neatly, use staples to tighten the pocket, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c12.html#int_244" id="ref_int_244">Figure 241</a>. This will aid in keeping the coins in place.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title101"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">88. HYPER BANKING</span></h1>
<p class="p">In the future, banking will be done in higher dimensions. To illustrate, the magician deposits a coin into a slot in a piece of cardboard, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c12.html#int_245" id="ref_int_245">Figure 242</a>. The coin vanishes into hyperspace.</p>

<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> You will need a piece of cardboard measuring about 6” × 3½″. If cardboard is not available, a blank postcard of similar size may be used. A slot about 1¾″ wide is cut in the center of the cardboard.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Hold the cardboard in the left hand. Slide a half-dollar into the slot, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c12.html#int_245">Figure 242</a>. The left first finger behind the cardboard pulls the coin up until the coin is completely through the slot, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c12.html#int_246" id="ref_int_246">Figure 243</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The left first finger then slides the coin down behind the cardboard. The coin is gripped by the right first finger and pulled down below the slot, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c12.html#int_247" id="ref_int_247">Figure 244</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The left hand turns the top half of the cardboard over to show that the coin has vanished, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c12.html#int_248" id="ref_int_248">Figure 245</a>. Bend the cardboard without creasing it. The cardboard is then straightened out to the position shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c12.html#int_247">Figure 244</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The coin is then transferred back to the left first finger, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c12.html#int_246">Figure 243</a>. At this point, the right hand can bend the lower half of the cardboard upward to show again that the coin is gone.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Straighten out the cardboard. Slide the coin back into view as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c12.html#int_245">Figure 242</a>. Patter is to the effect that a deposit made here can end up in some other part of the world. If the depositor gets nervous about his money, he can always bring it back.</p>
<p class="p-indent">“Hyper Banking” is based on an ingenious routine invented by the British magician E. Brian MacCarthy.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title102"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">89. COIN-JURING</span></h1>
<p class="p">A coin is tossed upward. It vanishes into thin air. When the coin is caught in a hat, it drops through the hat and comes to rest in a drinking glass.</p>
<p class="p-indent">All props may be borrowed. Only the visible apparatus is used. There are no gimmicks.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> This routine is based on ideas of Al Lasher and the author. Required are a hat that has a hatband, a drinking glass and a coin. The coin can be a half-dollar, a silver dollar or a poker chip.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Display the coin and slip it into the hatband, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c12.html#int_249" id="ref_int_249">Figure 246</a>. Show the glass to the audience, then place it mouth up on the table near the hat.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Pretend to take the coin with the right hand. Actually, the right thumb pushes the coin all the way down into the band so the coin is completely concealed from audience view, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c12.html#int_250" id="ref_int_250">Figure 247</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Lift the hand as if it contained the coin. Pantomime tossing the coin into the air. Pretend to follow its flight by looking upward. Smile as you do this, as if pleased with the trajectory of the coin.</p>
<div class="illustype_image"><div class="image"><img alt="e9780486156637_i0254.jpg" src="images/e9780486156637_i0254.jpg"/></div>

<p class="p-indent">Allow the smile to fade slowly as you realize the coin has vanished into thin air. Stare upward. Then smile again, as if you have spotted the invisible coin.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Turn the hat brim upward. Hold the hat over the glass. Pretend to catch the coin in the hat. Look down into the hat and smile in a satisfied way, as if the coin has been caught successfully. At the same time, lower the hat sharply against the glass, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c12.html#int_251" id="ref_int_251">Figure 248</a>. This jars the coin loose, causing it to fall into the glass.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Pick up the glass and rattle it to emphasize the location of the coin, and take your bow.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title103"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">90. A STAB IN THE PACK</span></h1>
<p class="p">A randomly chosen card is returned to the deck. The deck is wrapped with a dollar bill and a rubber band. The magician picks up a knife and inserts the knife blade into the center of the pack. The deck is parted at that point. It is discovered that the knife has found the chosen card.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> The invention of Al Koran, this famous trick uses a dollar bill as a kind of visible index; the bill indicates where the deck should be stabbed to find the chosen card.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Jog the card that lies twentieth from the top of the deck. Place a dollar bill on top of the deck, then wrap it around the deck as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c12.html#int_252" id="ref_int_252">Figure 249</a>. Use a crisp new bill and make the creases sharp. Indicate with a pencil mark the location of the jogged card. The pencil mark is shown by the arrow in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c12.html#int_252">Figure 249</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Remove the dollar bill from the deck. Fold it carefully along the creases. Deal the top 20 cards of the deck into a pile on the table. Place the folded dollar bill on top of the pile. Then place the rest of the deck on top. Snap a rubber band around the deck. This completes the preparation.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When presenting the trick, remove the rubber band and place the deck on the table. Lift off about a third of the deck. Have the spectator shuffle this packet and remove a card. He initials the face of the card and places the initialed card on top of the packet.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The packet is replaced on top of the deck. Spread the deck from hand to hand until you get to the dollar bill. Cut the deck at that point and complete the cut. As you go through these actions, say, “This trick cost me a dollar to perform. Here’s the dollar.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Wrap the dollar around the deck, using the folded creases as a guide. The creases must line up exactly with the edges of the deck just as they did in the preliminary preparation of <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c12.html#int_252">Figure 249</a>. Snap the rubber band around the deck.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Hold the deck in one hand, table knife in the other. Stab the knife into the deck at exactly the point indicated by the pencil mark, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c12.html#int_253" id="ref_int_253">Figure 250</a>. If you twist the knife blade a bit after it is in the deck, the deck will open up slightly. Catch the reflection in the knife blade to spot the identity of the card above the knife.</p>
<div class="illustype_image"><div class="image"><img alt="e9780486156637_i0257.jpg" src="images/e9780486156637_i0257.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156637_c12.html#ref_int_252" id="int_252"><span class="b">Fig. 249</span></a></p></div></div>
<div class="illustype_image_net"><div class="image_net"><img alt="e9780486156637_i0258.jpg" src="images/e9780486156637_i0258.jpg"/></div>

<p class="p-indent">Leave the knife in the deck as you remove the rubber band and the dollar bill. Then lift up the cards above the knife. As you do this, ask for the name of the chosen card. If care was taken when the bill was wrapped around the deck, and if the knife was stabbed into the pack at the exact point indicated by the pencil mark, the chosen card will be either directly above or below the knife blade.</p>
<p class="p-indent">You know the name of the face card of the upper packet by spotting its reflection in the knife blade. If this is the chosen card, turn the upper packet over to show that the face card is the chosen card. Otherwise turn over the top card of the lower packet to reveal it as the chosen card.</p>
<p class="p-indent">In the original routine, Al Koran used distinguishing marks in the printing on a borrowed bill as a guide to line up the bill correctly when it was wrapped around the deck. Another distinguishing mark in the printing on the bill indicated the point at which the knife was to be stabbed into the pack. The reader may wish to familiarize himself with such marks so a borrowed bill can be employed in the event the trick is to be done impromptu.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title104"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">91. PAY DAY</span></h1>
<p class="p">“Pay Day” was introduced to magic by Tom Sellers. It is a commercial effect used by many magicians. In the following version, a borrowed $20 bill is sealed in an envelope. This envelope is mixed with two empty envelopes by a spectator.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Someone in the audience chooses one of the envelopes at random. This envelope is torn to pieces and thrown away. He then chooses another envelope. This envelope is also torn to pieces and thrown away.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Only one envelope remains. The spectator who lent the dollar bill is apprehensive that his bill was torn to shreds but, when the third envelope is opened, the borrowed bill is found safe inside.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> This handling is based on ideas suggested by Tom Harris and George Blake. Secretly place a pencil mark on one of the envelopes where you can easily spot it.</p>
<p class="p-indent">From a blank sheet of paper, cut out two dollar-size rectangles. Place one in each of the two unmarked envelopes and seal these envelopes. This completes the preparation.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Ask for the loan of a $20 bill. Have the spectator write his initials on the bill. Say, “That’s so you’ll recognize the bill in the event you ever see it again.” Seal the bill in the envelope that has the pencil dot.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Hand all three envelopes to a spectator. Have him mix the envelopes until he is satisfied no one could possibly know the location of the envelope that contains the borrowed bill. Hand him a marking pen. Have him place a 1 on the front of one envelope, a 2 on another and a 3 on a third. Make sure he draws the numerals large enough to be clearly visible to the audience.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Have the spectator hold up the envelopes so the numbers can be seen by the audience. Ask the owner of the $20 bill to call out one of the numbers. Say he calls out No. 3.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Take envelope No. 3. Check to see if it has the secret pencil mark. If so, direct the spectator to tear up the remaining two envelopes. Then open envelope No. 3 to show that the borrowed bill is undamaged.</p>
<p class="p-indent">If envelope No. 3 does not have the pencil mark, tear it up and toss it aside. To increase the bill lender’s anxiety, say, “I wish I had practiced this trick before attempting it.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">After the envelope has been torn, say, “Of the remaining two envelopes, would you select one for me?”</p>
<p class="p-indent">The spectator might call out envelope No. 1. Take envelope No. 1. Check to see if it has the pencil mark. If it does, place it in the outer handkerchief pocket of your jacket, so that most of the envelope is clearly visible. It is logical to take the envelope and place it in your pocket because you asked the spectator to choose an envelope <span class="i">for you</span>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Have envelope No. 2 torn and thrown away. As this is done, say, “After all, it’s only money.” Let the tension build, then open envelope No. 1 to show that the borrowed bill is undamaged.</p>
<p class="p-indent">If envelope No. 1 does not have the pencil mark, tear it up and throw it away. Then have the remaining envelope opened and the borrowed bill returned to its owner.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title105"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">92. SMART MONEY</span></h1>
<p class="p">The spectator removes a handful of change from his pocket. He chooses any coin and returns the other change to his pocket. The digits of the date on the chosen coin are multiplied together to arrive at a number. Then the number is reduced to a single digit.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The digit will be 9. The spectator opens <span class="i">Self-Working Coin Magic</span> to the first page of any chapter and notes the ninth word in the opening sentence. That word will be “of.” A previously written prediction is then opened to reveal that the magician correctly foretold that “of” would be chosen.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> This fine trick was invented by Sam Schwartz. Have the spectator choose a coin and note the date. Say the date is 1987. He multiplies the digits together to obtain 1 × 9 × 8 × 7 = 504.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The spectator then adds the digits in 504 together to obtain 5 + 0 + 4 = 9. Unknown to the spectator, the date on any twentieth-century coin will reduce to the single digit 9 if the above procedure is used. The spectator can use a calculator to aid in the arithmetic.</p>
<p class="p-indent"><span class="i">Self-Working Coin Magic</span> has been arranged so the ninth word in the opening sentence of any chapter is “of.” The spectator can even open the book to the Introduction. Write the word “of” as a prediction, fold the paper and drop it into a drinking glass.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Have a word chosen by the above method. Let the spectator open the paper and verify that you correctly predicted the chosen word.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Sometimes the addition process will have to be used twice to reduce the number to a single digit. If the date on the coin is 1988, the spectator multiplies the digits together to obtain 1 × 9 × 8 × 8 = 576.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The spectator adds the digits in 576 to obtain 5 + 7 + 6 = 18. Since this is not yet a single digit number, he adds the digits again to obtain 1 + 8 = 9. The spectator then notes the ninth word of any chapter. The rest of the trick proceeds as described above.</p></div></div>
