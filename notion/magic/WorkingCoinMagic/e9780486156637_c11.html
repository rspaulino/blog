<a id="title92"/><h1 class="title-chapter"><span class="b">HAUNTED HOUSE</span></h1>
<p class="p">Periodically, television and newspapers will feature news stories of people who claim to have had psychic experiences. John Mulholland, a skeptic on the subject, nevertheless recommended psychic themes as a marvelous way to establish a spooky atmosphere for the demonstration of magical effects.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The tricks in this chapter are based on the premise that the apparatus was discovered in a haunted house. Odd-looking coins can be obtained at antique shops. The boxes and glasses used in these tricks can be painted to appear antique. Such apparatus adds to the atmosphere of the magic.</p>
<div class="section1"><a id="title93"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">81. THRU AND THRU</span></h1>
<p class="p">Two opaque plastic drinking glasses are used for an offbeat trick devised by Roy Walton. The glasses are placed mouth up on the table. A coin is then dropped into one glass. This glass is held by the left hand.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The other glass is lifted to a position over the first glass, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c11.html#int_212" id="ref_int_212">Figure 210</a>. The magician says, “One glass is real, the other only a ghost of a glass. It passes right through the solid glass.” The upper glass is released and immediately penetrates the glass in the left hand.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The coin is then poured out of the left-hand glass. The visible penetration may be repeated.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_net"><div class="image_net"><img alt="e9780486156637_i0217.jpg" src="images/e9780486156637_i0217.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-d"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156637_c11.html#ref_int_212" id="int_212"><span class="b">Fig. 210</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> Secretly place a coin in an opaque plastic glass. Then nest another glass in this one. The glasses may be carried in this condition until the time of performance.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When ready to perform, place the nested glasses on the table. Lift out the upper glass. Drop a duplicate coin into it. Hold this glass near the rim with the left hand about 8” above the table.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Pick up the other glass by grasping it at the rim with the right hand. Take care not to rattle the coin in this glass. You want the audience to think the glass is empty.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Place this glass over the glass in the left hand, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c11.html#int_212">Figure 210</a>. Release the upper glass. It will drop into the lower glass. If the left hand has a light grip on its glass, the impact of the upper glass dropping into the lower glass will cause the lower glass to fall onto the table. The left hand will now hold the upper glass.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Properly performed, the illusion is that the upper glass penetrated the lower glass and dropped onto the table. The illusion is made perfect by the fact that after the glass drops onto the table, the left hand pours a coin out of its glass.</p>
<p class="p-indent">To finish, drop the empty glass into the other glass and place both glasses aside.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title94"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">82. REBOUND</span></h1>
<p class="p">A silver coin is wrapped in a piece of paper and placed in an envelope. A copper coin is dropped into the envelope. The magician snaps his fingers. The folded paper is removed and opened to reveal that now the copper coin is in the paper. The silver coin is then removed from the envelope.</p>
<p class="p-indent">There are no extra coins or gimmicks. The silver coin is inside the paper right up to the instant that the paper is removed from the envelope.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> This routine was devised by the author. The paper measures about 5½″ × 4”. The envelope is the end-opening type. It measures about 3½″ × 3”.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The folded paper can be kept inside the envelope. Remark that this is all that remains of a transaction that took place a century ago, in which someone sent money in the mail to purchase a rare coin. The mails operated more efficiently back then.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Place the silver coin at a point about ½″ below the center of the paper. Hold the coin in place with the left thumb, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c11.html#int_213" id="ref_int_213">Figure 211</a>. The lower left corner of the paper is marked with an <span class="i">X</span> as a reference point for the reader.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_text"><div class="image_text"><img alt="e9780486156637_i0218.jpg" src="images/e9780486156637_i0218.jpg"/></div>

<p class="p-indent">Fold the upper part of the paper down on top of the coin, so the edge is about ½″ above the bottom of the paper.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Then fold the right side of the paper over to the left, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c11.html#int_214" id="ref_int_214">Figure 212</a>. Fold the left side over to the right, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c11.html#int_215" id="ref_int_215">Figure 213</a>. Turn the paper over end for end (<span class="i">not</span> side for side). This brings the corner marked <span class="i">X</span> to the top as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c11.html#int_216" id="ref_int_216">Figure 214</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The protruding ½″ at the top is now folded down toward you. The completed fold looks as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c11.html#int_217" id="ref_int_217">Figure 215</a>. The coin appears to be trapped inside the paper. Unknown to the audience, the top of the paper is open.</p>

Then place the folded paper into the envelope. Maintain pressure on the coin until the folded paper rests securely on the bottom of the envelope. Remark that this was how that person in the distant past mailed out payment for the rare coin.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Display the copper coin, calling it the rare coin that was purchased. Drop it into the envelope, but make sure it slides into the folded paper as indicated by the arrow in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c11.html#int_219" id="ref_int_219">Figure 217</a>. The fingers of the hand holding the envelope can buckle the sides of the envelope to make this easier.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Say, “Here’s how quickly this fellow got the rare coin.” Snap the fingers. Reach into the envelope and remove the paper package, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c11.html#int_220" id="ref_int_220">Figure 218</a>. The silver coin automatically remains in the envelope.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Place the envelope on the table. Holding the copper coin in place concealed behind the paper, unfold the bottom and side flaps of the paper. Then pretend to dump the copper coin onto the table.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Say, “And the coin dealer got his money.” Tip the envelope to allow the silver coin to drop to the table.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The transposition can be done between such dissimilar objects as a coin and a key or a coin and a poker chip.</p>

<p class="p">The magician reenacts a card game from bygone days in which one fellow’s bet mysteriously ended up in the other fellow’s possession. As the audience sees it, a coin is covered with a playing card. Another card is placed on the table. The coin vanishes from under the first card and appears under the second. The effect is immediately repeated with a second coin.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> A prepared card is used. Trim about ¼″ from one long side of a playing card, cutting away the portion shown by the dotted lines in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c11.html#int_221" id="ref_int_221">Figure 219</a>. Then glue an unprepared card on top of this card. Glue is applied as shown by the shaded lines in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c11.html#int_222" id="ref_int_222">Figure 220</a>.

<p class="p-indent">Place four quarters in a group on the table. Closer to you and to the left place the pocket card. The opening of the pocket is toward you. Place an unprepared playing card to the right of the pocket card. The layout is shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c11.html#int_223" id="ref_int_223">Figure 221</a>. The pocket card is at <span class="i">A,</span> the unprepared card at <span class="i">B<span class="b">.</span></span> Both cards are face down. The trick should be performed on a soft surface like a tablecloth.</p>

<p class="p-indent">Remark that you found the cards and coins just like this on a table in a haunted house. <span class="i">A</span> card game was in progress. You will try to reenact the game as you think it progressed.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Take one of the quarters with the right hand. The left hand grasps the pocket card from above. The thumb lifts the near edge of the upper card. Pretend to place the quarter under this card. Actually, insert it into the pocket, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c11.html#int_224" id="ref_int_224">Figure 222</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Pick up another quarter. Place it under the card at position <span class="i">B.</span> Remark that the bets were covered with cards, and that the players had the option of trading cards. Grasp the card at <span class="i">A</span> with the left hand. Grasp the card at <span class="i">B</span> with the right hand.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Place the right-hand card on top of the left-hand card, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c11.html#int_225" id="ref_int_225">Figure 223</a>.

<div class="section1"><a id="title96"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">84. SEALED-BOX MYSTERY</span></h1>
<p class="p">A cardboard matchbox is shown empty and placed on the table. A coin is placed under the table. Immediately, the coin penetrates the table and appears inside the matchbox. The trick may be repeated.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> This is a new handling of a classic trick. Beforehand, place a coin like a quarter on the inside bottom of the matchbox. Close the drawer or tray so it rides over the coin, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c11.html#int_228" id="ref_int_228">Figure 226</a>. The coin is now trapped between the drawer and the box. It will remain in this position until you are ready to perform the routine. You can have a few matches in the drawer.</p>
<p class="p-indent">To perform the routine, slide the drawer out with the left hand. Grasp the box between the right thumb and fingers, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c11.html#int_229" id="ref_int_229">Figure 227</a>. The thumb goes directly on top of the quarter. The right hand is palm up.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Pull the drawer clear of the box. Show the box and drawer on both sides. Unknown to the audience, there is a quarter inside the box, held in place with the right thumb.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Turn the right hand palm down. Slide the drawer back into the box, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c11.html#int_230" id="ref_int_230">Figure 228</a>. The quarter will end up trapped between the top edge of the drawer and the top of the box, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c11.html#int_231" id="ref_int_231">Figure 229-A</a>. It will remain in this position as long as the drawer is in the partially open position shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c11.html#int_231">Figure 229-A</a>.</p>

<p class="p-indent">Show a duplicate quarter. Place it under the table. Drop it into the shoe or leave it in the lap. As the right hand goes under the table, the left hand grasps the matchbox, fingers at the left side, thumb at the right side.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The right hand raps against the underside of the table. At the same time the left hand taps the matchbox against the table and closes the drawer. The result is that the quarter will fall into the matchbox with an audible clink. The illusion is that the quarter penetrated up through the table and landed inside the matchbox with a loud clink.</p>
<p class="p-indent">There is a little-known repeat version of the trick. To begin, place one coin on the bottom of the box as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c11.html#int_228">Figure 226</a>. Slide the drawer into the box until it is almost flush. Then slide another quarter between the drawer and the top of the box as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c11.html#int_232" id="ref_int_232">Figure 229-B</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Place the box on the table. Display another coin (a third quarter) and place it under the table. Remark that the box represents a locked room in the house and the quarter a ghost. You are going to demonstrate how the ghost manages to materialize in the locked room.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When the right hand is under the table, tuck the quarter into the sock. Rap the right hand against the bottom of the table. At the same time, close the box with the left hand. The result is that the quarter trapped between the drawer and the box will fall into the box.</p>
<p class="p-indent">With the box kept on the table, open the box to show the quarter. Dump the quarter onto the table. Now grasp the box as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c11.html#int_229">Figure 227</a>. The right thumb goes on top of the coin that is still inside the box. Pull the drawer clear of the box with the right hand. Then show the box and drawer on both sides. Replace the drawer in the box as in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c11.html#int_230">Figure 228</a>. Then go on with the rest of the handling as described above.

<p class="p">This is a modernized version of an old puzzle in which you demonstrate how to push a coin through a hole that is smaller than the coin. First you perform the classic method of working a coin through a hole slightly smaller than the diameter of the coin. Then you cause the coin to slide visibly through a hole that is <span class="i">much</span> smaller than the coin.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> The routine is based on ideas of John Howie and the author. It uses one piece of paper and one coin. In the following description it will be assumed that a half-dollar is the coin you will use.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The paper measures 6” × 4½″. The upper hole, labeled <span class="i">A</span> in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c11.html#int_233" id="ref_int_233">Figure 230</a>, is just slightly smaller than a half-dollar. The other hole, labeled <span class="i">B,</span> is smaller than <span class="i">A,</span> measuring less than ¾″ in diameter.</p>

<p class="p">The semicircular cutouts around the border correspond in size to circle <span class="i">B.</span> Fold the paper along the dotted lines to complete the preparation.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Display the paper and the half-dollar. Place the coin against circle <span class="i">A,</span> <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c11.html#int_234" id="ref_int_234">Figure 231</a>. Fold the paper down along the upper dotted line <span class="i">X-X</span> so the coin is inside the paper. Turn the paper over end for end and hold it as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c11.html#int_235" id="ref_int_235">Figure 232</a>. Make it clear that the circular cutout is smaller than the coin. Ask the spectator if he can get the coin to slide through the hole in the paper without tearing the paper.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The solution is to grip the paper as in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c11.html#int_235">Figure 232</a>. Bend the sides upward. This has the effect of widening the hole enough for the coin to fall through.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Now offer to try the more difficult task of causing the coin to fall through the smaller hole <span class="i">B.</span> Place the coin just below hole <span class="i">A,</span> <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c11.html#int_236" id="ref_int_236">Figure 233</a>. Fold the upper part of the paper down over the coin along the dotted lines just above the coin, shown as <span class="i">X-X</span> in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c11.html#int_236">Figure 233</a>. Fold the right side around in front, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c11.html#int_237" id="ref_int_237">Figure 234</a>.</p>

<p class="p-indent">Fold the left side around in front, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c11.html#int_238" id="ref_int_238">Figure 235</a>. Then fold the bottom portion around in front. This brings you to the situation shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c11.html#int_239" id="ref_int_239">Figure 236</a>. Allow the coin to slide to the position shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c11.html#int_239">Figure 236</a>. The apparatus may be shown on both sides. It seems clearly impossible to get the half-dollar through the small hole.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Grasp the coin, pretend to tug on it, then pull it clear of the paper. Unfold the paper by starting at the position of <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c11.html#int_239">Figure 236</a> and working back to <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c11.html#int_236">Figure 233</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">By way of patter, remark that you found a worn piece of paper and an ancient coin in a haunted house. The coin seemed to have the ability to change its size. Then go on to demonstrate the above routine.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title98"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">86. COINS AND CUPS</span></h1>
<p class="p">Two paper cups and eight coins are used to reenact a classic mystery. Four coins are placed in each cup. One at a time, the coins invisibly leave one cup and appear in the other.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> The paper cups should measure about 5” in height. One of them is prepared by cutting a slot in the base. The slot should be just wide enough so the coin will protrude from the slot without sliding completely through. If half-dollars are used, the slot should measure slightly more than an inch across.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Also needed are nine identical coins. Place one in the unprepared cup. Nest the prepared cup inside it, then drop the other eight coins inside the prepared cup.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When presenting the routine, grasp both cups and pour the eight coins out onto the table. Place the nested cups mouth up on the table. Make sure the slot in the prepared cup is positioned at the back, that is, away from the spectators.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Pick up the prepared cup with the right hand. Tip the mouth slightly back toward you. Drop in a coin, counting, “One.” This coin will protrude through the slot when it hits the bottom of the cup. Hold it in place by pressure of the right thumb, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c11.html#int_240" id="ref_int_240">Figure 237</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Count three more coins into the cup. Then pick up the other four coins with the left hand. Count them aloud as you pick them up. Drop them together into the unprepared cup.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Hold a cup in each hand. Give them a shake. Then tip the right-hand cup down and allow three coins to fall out. The thumb retains the fourth coin in the slot. Make sure you keep the mouth of the cup away from the audience to keep them from seeing into the cup.</p>
<div class="illustype_image"><div class="image"><img alt="e9780486156637_i0245.jpg" src="images/e9780486156637_i0245.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-c"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156637_c11.html#ref_int_240" id="int_240"><span class="b">Fig. 237</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">Pour the coins out of the left-hand cup. Place this cup down. Use the left hand to count these five coins into the prepared cup. Release the right thumb’s grip on the coin in the slot. Then pour all the coins from this cup into the unprepared cup. Unknown to the audience, there are now six coins in the unprepared cup.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Repeat the same procedure so that the second and third coins apparently pass from one cup to another. At this point there will be eight coins in the unprepared cup. The audience thinks there are seven.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Pick up the last coin on the table and place it in your pocket. Snap the fingers. Then pour the coins out of the unprepared cup into the hand. Count them one at a time back into the cup to show that the eighth coin has vanished from the pocket and has appeared in the cup.</p></div></div>
