<a id="title78"/><h1 class="title-chapter"><span class="b">SHORTCHANGE TRICKS</span></h1>
<p class="p">People benefit from knowing the secrets and methods of confidence men and shortchange artists. Such knowledge arms the public with valuable information on what to look for in their dealings with strangers. This chapter describes three of the best shortchange tricks. If there is a moral that connects these tricks, it is that, when money changes hands with strangers, people should be sure to count their change.</p>
<div class="section1"><a id="title79"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">70. BUNCO BILLS</span></h1>
<p class="p">To show how the shortchange artist works, a volunteer spectator makes an imagined $3.75 purchase with a $10 bill. The magician slowly counts his change. All seems fair, but when the count is checked, it is seen the spectator has been shortchanged a dollar.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> Needed are five $1 bills. Fold a bill in half in the offset condition shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c08.html#int_186" id="ref_int_186">Figure 184</a>. Place it second from the bottom of the stack of five bills. This is the only preparation. One or two of the unprepared bills should be face down in the stack.</p>

<p class="p-indent">Explain that, where large crowds gather, the shortchange artist will ply his trade when someone makes, for example, a $3.75 purchase with a $10 bill. The purchaser should get back $6.25 in change.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Fan the bills as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c08.html#int_187" id="ref_int_187">Figure 185</a>. The left thumb hides the folded condition of the bill second from the bottom.</p>
<p class="p-indent">On the count of one, lift the top bill with the right first finger as indicated in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c08.html#int_187">Figure 185</a>. Keep this bill isolated from the others by flipping it over the right thumb, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c08.html#int_188" id="ref_int_188">Figure 186</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">On the count of two, lift the second bill with the right first finger. Flip it over the right thumb. Continue in this way with the remaining bills. Because one bill is folded, it is counted twice. The audience is unaware that you counted five bills as six.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When you have counted the final bill, square up the stack of bills from side to side. Then take the bottom bill with the right hand. Curl the left fingers over the stack, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c08.html#int_189" id="ref_int_189">Figure 187</a>. Use these fingers to fold the stack in half. Then place the stack on top of the bill in the right hand and fold this bill in half over the other bills.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Place the folded stack in the spectator’s hand. Then give him the remaining 25 cents in change by placing three nickels and a dime on top of the folded bills. Explain that by giving the spectator a handful of folded bills and loose change, he has a handful of money and is unlikely to check the count.</p>

<p class="p-indent">It is only later that the spectator realizes he has been shortchanged. Have him count the bills in his hand. He should have six but he discovers he has only five. The shortchange artist has made a dollar on the transaction.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title80"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">71. SHORTCHANGED</span></h1>
<p class="p">Using borrowed money, the magician shows that, even with the money in the spectator’s pocket, it is an easy matter to shortchange the unwary.</p>

<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> A clever invention of Raymond Beebee is responsible for the working of this routine. Fold a $5 bill in half the long way as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c08.html#int_190" id="ref_int_190">Figure 188</a>, with the picture of Lincoln on the inside. Then fold the right half to the left, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c08.html#int_191" id="ref_int_191">Figure 189</a>. Fold the right half to the left again as shown by the arrow in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c08.html#int_191">Figure 189</a>.</p>

<p class="p-indent">Fold a dollar bill in half the long way, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c08.html#int_192" id="ref_int_192">Figure 190</a>, so the picture of Washington is on the inside. Then fold the left half to the right to bring you to the position shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c08.html#int_193" id="ref_int_193">Figure 191</a>. Fold the left half to the right as shown by the arrow in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c08.html#int_193">Figure 191</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Interweave the two folded bills, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c08.html#int_194" id="ref_int_194">Figure 192</a>. The result is a packet that looks like a $5 bill on one side and a $1 bill on the other. Place this double bill under a heavy weight overnight to flatten it out. When ready to perform the trick, place the double bill in the right jacket pocket with the $5 side toward the body. The bill should go into the change compartment in the pocket so you can locate it easily later on.</p>
<p class="p-indent">To perform, remark that a shortchange artist once showed you his method of making money. Ask the spectator to remove a $5 bill from his pocket. Remove a $1 bill from your pocket.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The spectator follows with the $5 bill as you fold the $1 bill in eighths. Use the handling described above so each bill is folded with the President’s picture on the inside.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Place the $1 bill in your right jacket pocket, toward the front of the pocket. Take the $5 bill from the spectator. Place it in the same pocket, but toward the back of the pocket.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Say, “First you have to learn how to tell one bill from another by sense of touch. That way you don’t have to look at the bills when you’re handling them.” Reach into the pocket. Pause and say, “This should be the $1 bill.” Remove the $1 bill from the pocket.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Then reach into the pocket to remove the $5 bill. Actually, you remove the double bill with the $5 side uppermost. Place both bills in the spectator’s pocket. Have him mix them. Say, “I can find the $1 bill by touch.” Then reach into his pocket and remove the double bill. Because of the double thickness, you should have no trouble finding this bill by sense of touch. When the double bill is brought into view, make sure the $1 side is uppermost.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Say, “Here’s the $1 bill,” as you remove the double bill from the spectator’s pocket. Place this bill into your right jacket pocket, back into the change compartment.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Start to perform another trick. Then say, “Telling one bill from another is only one thing the shortchange artist does. He wouldn’t make money that way. <span class="i">This</span> is how he makes his money.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Reach into your jacket pocket. Remove the spectator’s $5 bill. The spectator should be surprised that you somehow got his money.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title81"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">72. BAMBOOZLED</span></h1>
<p class="p">Ideas of Bert Allerton and Dai Vernon are combined in the following routine. The effect is one in which paper money is counted several times. Each time the total is different. Although it appears the magician has been swindled, in the end he comes out ahead of the game.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> Use play money for this routine. You will need six $1 bills and two $5 bills. Apply glue or rubber cement to the right half of the front of a $1 bill. The treated portion is shown shaded in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c08.html#int_195" id="ref_int_195">Figure 193</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Place a $5 bill on top of the treated $1 bill, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c08.html#int_196" id="ref_int_196">Figure 194</a>. The right half of the $5 bill is now pasted or stuck to the right half of the $1 bill. Place this prepared bill on top of a stack of the other $1 bills, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c08.html#int_197" id="ref_int_197">Figure 195</a>. The open end of the prepared bill is at the bottom. Place the unprepared $5 bill in the trouser pocket.</p>

<p class="p-indent">When presenting the routine, remark that you were once in a nightclub known to be a clip joint. At the end of the meal you asked for change of a $10 bill.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Hold the stack in the left hand. The prepared bill is uppermost. Count the bills from hand to hand one at a time, beginning with the $5 bill, as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c08.html#int_198" id="ref_int_198">Figure 196</a>. Count the bills on top of one another. Count out loud, and make sure to count the bills slowly so the audience can follow the action. Say, “The cashier counted a FIVE and five ONES.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Place the stack back into the left hand. Count the bills once more. The stack is back in its original order with the prepared bill on top.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When you complete the count, place the right first finger between the layers of the prepared bill, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c08.html#int_199" id="ref_int_199">Figure 197</a>. Then fold the upper half of the stack onto the lower half, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c08.html#int_200" id="ref_int_200">Figure 198</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Say, “It looked fair, but as I walked away, I decided to check the count.” Allow the right second, third and fourth fingers to release their grip. The stack will open outward as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c08.html#int_201" id="ref_int_201">Figure 199</a>. This action turns the stack over. The prepared bill is now on the bottom of the stack, folded.</p>

<p class="p-indent">Count the bills from left to right again, counting the bills one at a time on top of one another. The stack now contains six $1 bills. Say, “I had only six dollars, so I went back to the cashier.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Place the stack in the left hand. As you say, “The cashier counted the bills,” count the bills one at a time from hand to hand. The count shows six dollars.</p>
<p class="p-indent">“The cashier apologized. He took a single from the stack and put it in my pocket, saying, ‘That is for your trouble.’ Then he gave me a fresh $5 bill.” Suiting the action to your words, remove the top $1 bill and tuck it into the outer handkerchief pocket of the jacket. Take the $5 bill from the trouser pocket and place it on top of the stack.</p>
<p class="p-indent">“I thanked the cashier for his generosity and left the nightclub.” The prepared bill is at the bottom of the stack, folded. Insert the right first finger into the fold between the layers of the prepared bill. Then fold the outer half of the stack underneath as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c08.html#int_202" id="ref_int_202">Figure 200</a>.</p>

<p class="p-indent">“When I told the story, people asked why I thanked the cashier. ‘After all,’ my friends said, ‘he tried to shortchange you.’ This is why I thanked him for his generosity.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Release the top half of the stack by taking the right thumb out of the way. The stack will open out flat with the prepared bill on top. Place the stack in the left hand.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Slowly count the bills from left to right. You will now have $14. Add the dollar bill from your handkerchief pocket, saying, “And this makes fifteen dollars. I may go back to that club again sometime!”</p></div></div>
