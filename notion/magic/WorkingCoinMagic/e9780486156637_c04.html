<a id="title27"/><h1 class="title-chapter"><span class="b">COIN STUNTS</span></h1>
<p class="p">One way to bring attention to the subject of coin magic is to perform a few stunts with coins. When you have audience attention focused on the apparatus, it is an easy matter to perform tricks with the coins. This chapter is a collection of some of the best stunts and puzzles with coins.</p>
<div class="section1"><a id="title28"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">23. STAY PUT</span></h1>
<p class="p">A coin is balanced on the first finger. The first finger is slapped against the palm of the other hand, yet the coin mysteriously remains balanced on the first finger. The feat cannot be duplicated unless the spectator knows the secret.</p>
<div class="illustype_image"><div class="image"><img alt="e9780486156637_i0072.jpg" src="images/e9780486156637_i0072.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-c"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156637_c04.html#ref_int_68" id="int_68"><span class="b">Fig. 67</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> Balance a coin on the right first finger as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c04.html#int_68" id="ref_int_68">Figure 67</a>. Hold the palm-up left hand under the right hand. The left fingers are curled upward.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Turn the right hand palm down. As you swing the right hand down toward the left palm, press the coin against the right thumb, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c04.html#int_69" id="ref_int_69">Figure 68</a>. The thumb and first finger bend back out of sight.</p>
<div class="illustype_image"><div class="image"><img alt="e9780486156637_i0073.jpg" src="images/e9780486156637_i0073.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-c"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156637_c04.html#ref_int_69" id="int_69"><span class="b">Fig. 68</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">The right second finger slaps against the left palm as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c04.html#int_69">Figure 68</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">As the right hand moves back to the position shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c04.html#int_68">Figure 67</a>, the action is reversed. The first finger straightens, while the second finger curls inward.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Make sure the audience is in front of you. Keep the left fingers curled. As shown in the audience view of <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c04.html#int_69">Figure 68</a>, this helps conceal the action from the spectators.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Done three or four times in quick succession, the stunt produces the illusion that the coin is mysteriously stuck to the finger. Spectators unfamiliar with the secret will be unable to duplicate the feat.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title29"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">24. FLIP OUT</span></h1>
<p class="p">The magician places a coin on his palm-up hand. The coin is tossed into the air. Curiously, it spins rapidly, as if it had been flipped by the thumb and finger.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> Rest the coin on the open palm. As the coin is tossed upward, allow the tip of the thumb to contact the edge of the coin. It is this action that imparts a spin to the coin.</p>
<p class="p-indent">There is a variation that is even more puzzling. Place a penny, a nickel and a dime on the open palm. The coins are some distance from one another, with the penny near the thumb, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c04.html#int_70" id="ref_int_70">Figure 69</a>.</p>
<div class="illustype_image"><div class="image"><img alt="e9780486156637_i0074.jpg" src="images/e9780486156637_i0074.jpg"/></div>

<p class="p-indent">As you toss all three coins into the air, remark that the copper in the penny absorbs more heat than other coins and will act differently.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When you make the toss, allow the edge of the penny (and no other coin) to contact the thumb. This imparts a spin to the penny. When the coins are in the air, only the penny will be spinning.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title30"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">25. THE PIVOT</span></h1>
<p class="p">Hold two quarters together between the thumb and second finger, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c04.html#int_71" id="ref_int_71">Figure 70</a>. The tip of the first finger contacts the edge of the front quarter, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c04.html#int_72" id="ref_int_72">Figure 71</a>, and pulls it up and over the other quarter. The front quarter, shown shaded in these drawings, ends up in back of the other quarter. The back quarter remains stationary throughout.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Once learned, the stunt can be repeated rapidly. Others who try the stunt will find it difficult to perform.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> To the audience, the trick looks as shown in the drawings. In fact it is impossible to perform that way because the back quarter will move or tip as soon as you attempt to pull the front quarter upward.</p>

<p class="p-indent">The secret is that the first finger contacts the front quarter at a point near the middle finger, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c04.html#int_73" id="ref_int_73">Figure 72-A</a>, and rolls or pivots the quarter upward against the thumb, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c04.html#int_74" id="ref_int_74">Figure 72-B</a>. Once the quarter has moved upward, it is an easy matter to tip the front quarter over the other quarter.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title31"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">26. REFLEXES</span></h1>
<p class="p">Hold a dollar bill at about the center between your right thumb and first finger. Place the left hand in a similar position on the other side of the bill, but keep the left fingers open. The position is shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c04.html#int_75" id="ref_int_75">Figure 73</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Release the bill from the right hand and immediately catch it with the left, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c04.html#int_76" id="ref_int_76">Figure 74</a>. Repeat this a few times. It looks easy to catch the bill.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_text"><div class="image_text"><img alt="e9780486156637_i0079.jpg" src="images/e9780486156637_i0079.jpg"/></div>

<div class="illustype_image_text"><div class="image_text"><img alt="e9780486156637_i0080.jpg" src="images/e9780486156637_i0080.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-c"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156637_c04.html#ref_int_76" id="int_76"><span class="b">Fig. 74</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">Ask the spectator if he would like to try it. Hold the bill at the midpoint between the right thumb and first finger. Have the spectator place his open left hand in the position shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c04.html#int_75">Figure 73</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Release the bill. It will slide past the spectator’s hand before he is able to catch it. No matter how often the effect is repeated, the spectator will find it impossible to catch the bill.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title32"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">27. METAL BENDING</span></h1>
<p class="p">Hold a half-dollar or a silver dollar at opposite edges of the coin between the tips of the thumbs and forefingers.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Rock the coin back and forth between the hands as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c04.html#int_77" id="ref_int_77">Figures 75</a> and <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c04.html#int_78" id="ref_int_78">76</a>. If you do this in front of a mirror you will see that a curious illusion is produced: the coin appears to bend as if made of rubber.</p>
<p class="p-indent">If you find a bent coin, keep it until ready to perform this stunt. The bent coin is kept in the pocket along with an unprepared coin. The unprepared coin is removed and the metal-bending illusion produced as described above.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The coin is dropped in the pocket. If the spectator appears skeptical, reach into the pocket and remove the bent coin. Enact the illusion again, then toss the bent coin out onto the table.</p>

<div class="section1"><a id="title33"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">28. TOWER OF NICKELS</span></h1>
<p class="p">Ten nickels are stacked on top of one another. A dime is placed on top of the stack. The problem is to shift the position of the dime so it is second from the top of the stack of ten nickels. This is to be done without touching the stack, and it is to be accomplished in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> When the spectator gives up, remove another nickel from your pocket. In a quick motion flick it toward the stack, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c04.html#int_79" id="ref_int_79">Figure 77</a>, so it knocks the bottom coin out of the stack. Place this nickel on top of the stack and the problem is solved.</p>
<div class="illustype_image"><div class="image"><img alt="e9780486156637_i0083.jpg" src="images/e9780486156637_i0083.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-c"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156637_c04.html#ref_int_79" id="int_79"><span class="b">Fig. 77</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">The spectator may object, saying he thought you were not allowed to touch the coins, but that was not one of the conditions. All you said was that he was not allowed to touch the stack itself, not a coin propelled away from the stack.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The stack may be tilted or canted away from the direction of the incoming nickel. This increases the chances of the stack remaining intact when the bottom nickel is knocked out of the way.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title34"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">29. BILLFLlP</span></h1>
<p class="p">Preliminary to some trick, the magician removes his billfold and places it at the near edge of the table. When he reaches for the billfold, it jumps into the air. The magician catches it in midflight.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> This stunt can be used with any trick in which you use paper money. For example, if performing “Bunco Bills” (No. 70), take the billfold from the pocket, remove the dollar bills, then place the billfold at the edge of the table as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c04.html#int_80" id="ref_int_80">Figure 78</a>. The billfold should overhang the table’s edge as much as possible without falling.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_text_net"><div class="image_text_net"><img alt="e9780486156637_i0084.jpg" src="images/e9780486156637_i0084.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-d"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156637_c04.html#ref_int_80" id="int_80"><span class="b">Fig. 78</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">Place the dollar bills on the table. Place both hands in the lap. Remark that you would like to demonstrate a trick using the bills. Notice the billfold. Say, “We won’t need this.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">The right hand comes up from the lap. The back of the hand hits the billfold, propelling it into the air. The billfold will turn over as shown by the arrow in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c04.html#int_80">Figure 78</a>. The right hand, still palm down, catches the billfold while it is in the air.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When practicing, at first do not try to catch the billfold. Instead, concentrate on causing the billfold to flip as high as possible in the air. The stunt can also be done with a cased deck of playing cards. Only the brave will try it with a loose deck of cards.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title35"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">30. SPREAD THE WEALTH</span></h1>
<p class="p">The magician draws the map shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c04.html#int_81" id="ref_int_81">Figure 79</a>. He explains that the straight lines represent roads. The points are labeled with the names of states. The magician mentions that Congress has come up with a new idea for the distribution of wealth.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The system is demonstrated by placing a coin on any state on the map, and then sliding the coin straight across a road to another state. For example, if a coin is placed on Nevada, it can be moved straight across to Kansas or Ohio.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_text"><div class="image_text"><img alt="e9780486156637_i0085.jpg" src="images/e9780486156637_i0085.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-d"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156637_c04.html#ref_int_81" id="int_81"><span class="b">Fig. 79</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">Each time, a coin must be placed on a state that has no coin. The coin is then slid along a straight road to a state that does not have a coin. As the map gets filled up, it becomes harder to transfer money from state to state. The object is to use the above process to get a coin to seven of the eight states.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> The secret is simple but well concealed. Place a coin on Maine, then slide it to Kansas. Place the next coin on a state from which you can slide it to Maine. In the above example, place a coin on Texas and slide it to Maine.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The next coin is placed so that you can slide it to Texas. In the above example, place a coin on Delaware and slide it to Texas.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The pattern should be clear. Start by placing a coin on state <span class="i">A</span> and sliding it to state <span class="i">B.</span> Then place a coin on state <span class="i">C</span> so that it can slide to state <span class="i">A.</span> Place the next coin on state <span class="i">D</span> so you can slide it to C, and so on.</p>
<p class="p-indent">In a sample solution, the sequence would be Maine to Kansas, Texas to Maine, Delaware to Texas, Iowa to Delaware, Idaho to Iowa, Ohio to Idaho, Nevada to Ohio. This clever presentation was suggested by Tom Fitzgerald.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title36"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">31. PENNY HEX</span></h1>
<p class="p">This stunt is easy to do, but nearly impossible to reconstruct, even after the secret is demonstrated.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The problem is to start with six pennies arranged as in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c04.html#int_82" id="ref_int_82">Figure 80</a>, and transform the layout to the one shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c04.html#int_83" id="ref_int_83">Figure 81</a> in the fewest number of moves. A move consists of sliding a coin to a new position so that it touches two other coins.</p>

<p class="p-indent">It can be solved in three moves. Move 6 so it touches 4 and 5. Move 5 so it touches 2 and 3 from below. Move 3 so it touches 5 and 6.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Ask the spectator if he would like to try it. Pretend to arrange the coins in the position of <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c04.html#int_82">Figure 80</a>, but really arrange them as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c04.html#int_84" id="ref_int_84">Figure 82</a>.

<p class="p-indent">Coins are now eliminated by the method of jumping used in checkers, i.e., one coin jumps over another and lands in the vacant space. The jumped-over coin is removed from play. The goal is to continue in this way until one coin remains on the layout.</p>

<p class="p-indent">As in checkers, a jump over one coin, then another, then another is considered a single move. What is the least number of moves required to win on the ten-coin layout?</p>
<p class="p-indent">It can be done in five moves by removing the coin at position 3, then jumping as follows. Jump 10 to 3, 1 to 6, 8 to 10 to 3, 4 to 6 to 1 to 4, 7 to 2.</p></div>

<p class="p">How many heads are there on a quarter? Two—Washington’s head on one side and the head of the eagle on the other. This is sometimes expressed as a wager. Bet that you can change the spectator’s quarter into a two-headed coin. Take the quarter, wave the hand over it, then show the head on each side. (The 1976 Bicentennial quarter has more than two heads.)</p></div>

<p class="p">How many eyes are on a dollar bill? This is a double-catch question. Most people answer two for the two eyes on Washington.

<p class="p">If a $5 bill is tossed in the air, what is the probability it will land with Lincoln’s picture on top?</p>
<p class="p-indent">Lincoln’s picture appears on the face of the bill. It is also in the Lincoln Memorial on the back of a $5 bill so, no matter how the bill lands, Lincoln’s picture will be uppermost.</p></div>

<p class="p-indent">The answer is that one coin is a nickel and the other is a half-dollar. When the magician opens his hand he points to the nickel and says, “That’s the coin that’s not the half-dollar.”</p></div>

<p class="p-indent">The solution is to move 4 to 7, 6 to 2,1 to 3, and 5 to 8. If you want to extend the puzzle so you start with ten pennies and have to end with five pairs, there is a simple solution. Jump 7 to 10. You now have a row of eight pennies and can proceed as already described.</p></div>

<p class="p">How many ones can be found on every dollar bill? The word “One” appears in eight places on all $1 bills. The numeral “1” appears in ten places. The reader should find eight 1’s easily, but the other two are not immediately apparent. There is a 1 in the year of the series and a 1 in the date at the base of the pyramid.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title50"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">45. DATE BET</span></h1>
<p class="p">Have the spectator put his hand into his change pocket and remove a coin in his closed fist. Ask him to guess the year on the coin. Bet him that you can guess a closer year if given two chances.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Whatever year he names, name the year before and the year after. For example, he names 1985. You would then name 1984 and 1986. Unless he hits the year exactly, one of your years must be closer to the year on the coin.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title51"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">46. BALANCING ACT</span></h1>
<p class="p">Ask someone if he can balance a coin on the edge of a dollar bill. The spectator will give up after a few tries. You then take the coin and bill from him to show how it is done.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Fold the bill in half lengthwise. Then fold it in half widthwise. Make sure the folds are sharp.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Place the bill on the table and balance the coin on it as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c04.html#int_91" id="ref_int_91">Figure 89</a>. Grasp the ends of the bill and pull the bill out straight with a smooth, steady action. The result will be that the coin rests on the edge of the bill as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c04.html#int_92" id="ref_int_92">Figure 90</a>.</p>

<p class="p-indent">Try it with different-sized coins to see which works best. R. L. Cooper suggests that when the bill is in the straightened position shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c04.html#int_92">Figure 90</a> you can lift the bill off the table with the coin in the balanced position.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Another way to perform “Balancing Act” is to hand the spectator two dimes and the dollar bill. Ask if he thinks he can balance both coins on the edge of the bill at the same time. It seems an impossible feat. When he gives up, stack the two coins squarely on top of one another, then rest them on top of the bill, as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c04.html#int_91">Figure 89</a>. Proceed from there with the handling as written.</p></div>

<p class="p">Ten dimes and ten pennies are placed in four rows of five coins each so dimes and pennies alternate, as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c04.html#int_93" id="ref_int_93">Figure 91</a>. The problem is this: Using the first and second fingers of one hand, in one continuous move of any coins that can be touched, convert the layout to the one shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c04.html#int_94" id="ref_int_94">Figure 92</a>, where there is a row of pennies, a row of dimes, and so on. There can be no empty spaces. No row can be lengthened or shortened.</p>
<p class="p-indent">You will appreciate the solution much more if you try solving the problem before reading further.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> Emil Jarrow originated “Confucius Coins.” In <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c04.html#int_93">Figure 91</a>, the two dimes in the top row are labeled <span class="i">A</span> and <span class="i">B</span>.

<p class="p-indent">Push <span class="i">A</span> against the penny in the second position in the bottom row. Push <span class="i">B</span> against the penny in the fourth position in the bottom row. As you push these coins upward, the two vertical rows will move upward.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The dimes labeled <span class="i">A</span> and <span class="i">B</span> will then take their places in the bottom row as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c04.html#int_94">Figure 92</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The feat can be presented as a magical effect. Show the layout of <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c04.html#int_93">Figure 91</a>. Point out that the coins alternate in all rows and columns.</p>
<p class="p-indent">One hand then places a large square of cardboard over the layout to cover it. At the same time, the other hand performs the manipulation described above.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Once the layout has been covered and the move performed, snap the fingers, lift the cardboard to show that the layout has changed to the one shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c04.html#int_94">Figure 92</a>.

<div class="section1"><a id="title53"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">48. SHARPER’S</span> <span class="b">GAME</span></h1>
<p class="p">Twelve dimes and 12 pennies are arranged in the square layout shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c04.html#int_96" id="ref_int_96">Figure 94</a>. The spectator and the magician take turns making a move. A move consists in sliding a coin into the vacant space. The spectator gets silver, the magician copper.</p>
<p class="p-indent">A player loses when he is unable to make a move with one of his coins. If the spectator goes first, he must lose. This clever game was invented by G. W. Lewthwaite.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> The system is simple and requires no mental calculation. In <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c04.html#int_97" id="ref_int_97">Figure 95</a>, the two coins marked with the letter A have the same date. Similarly, the two coins marked with the letter <span class="i">B</span> have the same date. The dates on <span class="i">A-A</span> are different from the dates on <span class="i">B-B.</span></p>
<p class="p-indent">In this way each pair of coins is identified by the fact that each coin of the pair has the same date. Thus the two coins at <span class="i">A-A</span> might have the date 1980, the two coins at <span class="i">B-B</span> might have 1975, the two coins at <span class="i">C-C</span> might have 1990, and so forth.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When the spectator moves a silver coin into the vacant space, you follow by moving the copper coin of the same date into the new vacant space. Sooner or later the spectator will find it impossible to move.</p>
