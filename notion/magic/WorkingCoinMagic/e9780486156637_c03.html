<a id="title20"/><h1 class="title-chapter"><span class="b">MATTER THRU MATTER</span></h1>
<p class="p">Coin penetrations are considered among the most dramatic of magical effects. The tricks in this chapter are impromptu and represent outstanding creative thinking in magic.</p>
<div class="section1"><a id="title21"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">17. DROP KICK</span></h1>
<p class="p">This beautifully simple method of causing a coin to penetrate a tabletop was devised by J. W. Sarles. As the audience sees it, four half-dollars are placed in a stack on the table. The stack is covered with an inverted cup. Instantly, one half-dollar penetrates the table.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> Stack four half-dollars on top of one another, overlapping so that each coin is slightly forward of the coin beneath it. Place an inverted coffee cup over the stack in such a way that the lip of the cup is brought down on top of the bottom coin of the stack. The situation is shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c03.html#int_47" id="ref_int_47">Figure 46</a>.</p>
<div class="illustype_image"><div class="image"><img alt="e9780486156637_i0051.jpg" src="images/e9780486156637_i0051.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-c"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156637_c03.html#ref_int_47" id="int_47"><span class="b">Fig. 46</span></a></p></div></div>
<div class="illustype_image_net"><div class="image_net"><img alt="e9780486156637_i0052.jpg" src="images/e9780486156637_i0052.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-d"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156637_c03.html#ref_int_48" id="int_48"><span class="b">Fig. 47</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">Immediately, slide the stack forward to a point past the center of the table, in the direction of the arrow shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c03.html#int_47">Figure 46</a>. As you do, the bottom coin will remain in place. The right wrist will conceal the coin from audience view.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The right wrist bears down on the half-dollar. The right hand then brings the cup back toward the near edge of the table in the direction of the arrow shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c03.html#int_48" id="ref_int_48">Figure 47</a>. The result is that the coin under the wrist slides back. Continue drawing the cup back until the concealed coin falls off the table and into the lap. The cup should be near the center of the table at this point.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Show the left hand empty. Then place the left hand under the table. Grasp the coin in the lap and tap it against the underside of the table.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Lift the cup with the right hand. There are only three coins. Bring the fourth coin into view and toss it onto the table.</p>
<p class="p-indent">If, when practicing, you find that the coin dropped into the lap tends to fall or roll to the floor, spread a napkin or handkerchief on the lap prior to presenting the routine.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title22"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">18. TIMING PATTERN</span></h1>
<p class="p">Two coins are repeatedly counted onto the table. One coin is placed under the table. The other coin magically penetrates the table to join the first coin.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> This trick, a favorite of Jacob Daley, demonstrates how timing and rhythm can convert a simple handling into a puzzling mystery.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Place a coin on the table and another in the palm-up left hand, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c03.html#int_49" id="ref_int_49">Figure 48</a>. The right hand picks up the coin from the table by sliding it off the near edge. At the same time the left hand turns palm down in the direction of the arrow shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c03.html#int_50" id="ref_int_50">Figure 49</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The left hand slaps its coin onto the table. The other coin is held by the right thumb and first finger. The situation is shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c03.html#int_50">Figure 49</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The coin in the right hand is slapped onto the left palm, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c03.html#int_51" id="ref_int_51">Figure 50</a>. You are now back at the starting position. The timing should be such that you reach <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c03.html#int_50">Figure 49</a> on the count of one and <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c03.html#int_51">Figure 50</a> on the count of two. To put it another way, the left hand is slapped onto the table on the count of one, and the right hand is slapped onto the left palm for the count of two.</p>

<p class="p-indent">Repeat the above sequence several times. When you reach the position of <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c03.html#int_51">Figure 50</a> the final time, begin to take the coin from the table with the right hand, but instead draw the coin off the table and allow it to drop into the lap, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c03.html#int_52" id="ref_int_52">Figure 51</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Slap the left hand onto the table. Leave the coin there. Turn the left hand palm up. Slap the right hand onto the left palm as if slapping the coin onto the palm. The empty left palm then slaps the tabletop. The right hand draws the visible coin off the table and goes to the lap. Immediately the right hand picks up the coin in the lap.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The left hand is raised and turned palm up to show that the coin has vanished. The right hand then comes up into view with the two coins. Apparently one coin penetrated the tabletop.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title23"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">19. TUNNEL MOVE</span></h1>
<p class="p">The magician remarks that some tabletops have a built-in tunnel. He slaps a coin down on the table, slides it to the position directly over the invisible tunnel and causes the coin to penetrate the table.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> Unknown to the audience, two coins are used. One coin is concealed in the lap at the start. Display the duplicate coin on the left palm, then slap it down onto the table, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c03.html#int_53" id="ref_int_53">Figure 52</a>. The hand is about 10″-12″ from the near edge of the table.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_net"><div class="image_net"><img alt="e9780486156637_i0057.jpg" src="images/e9780486156637_i0057.jpg"/></div>

<p class="p-indent">Show the right hand empty and place it under the table. When the right hand is out of sight, allow it to take the coin from the lap. The right hand then moves to a position under the table that is directly below the left hand.</p>
<div class="illustype_image"><div class="image"><img alt="e9780486156637_i0058.jpg" src="images/e9780486156637_i0058.jpg"/></div>

<div class="illustype_image"><div class="image"><img alt="e9780486156637_i0059.jpg" src="images/e9780486156637_i0059.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156637_c03.html#ref_int_55" id="int_55"><span class="b">Fig. 54</span></a></p></div></div>
<div class="illustype_image_net"><div class="image_net"><img alt="e9780486156637_i0060.jpg" src="images/e9780486156637_i0060.jpg"/></div>

<p class="p-indent">The left hand pretends to slide its coin to the center of the table. Actually, the coin is left in place as the left hand moves outward. The coin is now under the left arm, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c03.html#int_54" id="ref_int_54">Figure 53</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">If the left hand really slid the coin out toward the center of the table, the coin would make a noise as it slid over the tabletop. Since there is no coin in the left hand, the sound must be simulated. This is accomplished in a subtle way. The right hand slides its coin along the underside of the table to create the sound.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When the left hand is at a point near the center of the table, slap it against the tabletop and spread the fingers, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c03.html#int_55" id="ref_int_55">Figure 54</a>. Immediately, bring the duplicate coin into view with the right hand.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Drop the visible coin onto the table. Then slide it back toward the body. At the same time draw the left arm back. The result is that the coin concealed under the left arm slides back and falls into the lap, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c03.html#int_56" id="ref_int_56">Figure 55</a>. The right hand can then toss the visible coin into the left, thus showing in an indirect way that only one coin has been used.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The above effect is based on a brilliant routine invented by Slydini.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title24"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">20. GLASS GO</span></h1>
<p class="p">“A magician from Tibet taught me two tricks,” the magician says. He places a newspaper-wrapped glass over two coins. “The first trick was a way to cause a coin to disappear.” The magician lifts the glass. The coins are still there.</p>
<p class="p-indent">He covers the coins again with the glass. When he lifts the glass, one coin has vanished, but it is obvious the coin is hidden under the other coin.</p>
<p class="p-indent">“The other trick was better,” the magician says. “He taught me how to push a glass through the table.” The magician slaps his hand on top of the newspaper covering the glass. The paper crumples. The glass has been pushed right through the table.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> This trick is a classic of misdirection. Wrap the glass with newspaper. Place the wrapped glass over a dime and a quarter, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c03.html#int_57" id="ref_int_57">Figure 56</a>. The coins rest on the table about 12” from the near edge.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Lift the wrapped glass away from the coins by bringing the glass back toward the near edge of the table. Let the audience see that nothing has happened.</p>
<div class="illustype_image"><div class="image"><img alt="e9780486156637_i0061.jpg" src="images/e9780486156637_i0061.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-c"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156637_c03.html#ref_int_57" id="int_57"><span class="b">Fig. 56</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">Bring the wrapped glass in front of the coins to screen them from audience view. Place the quarter on top of the dime, then cover the coins with the glass.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Remark that mind waves are needed to vanish the dime. Lift the glass and bring it to the near edge of the table. As the audience gazes at the coin, release pressure, allowing the glass to slide out of the paper and into the waiting right hand, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c03.html#int_58" id="ref_int_58">Figure 57</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The audience is sure to deduce that the dime “vanished” by the obvious expedient of concealing it under the quarter. Cover the coins with the newspaper. Because the newspaper retains its shape, the audience thinks the glass is still under the newspaper.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Say, “The <span class="i">other</span> trick was a better one. He taught me how to push a solid glass through the table.” Smash the newspaper down flat on the table. Bring the glass into view with the other hand.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The author has sometimes used a version with a different outcome. After failing two or three times to get one coin to vanish, the magician says, “If I try this long enough, I’ll need a cup of coffee to stay awake.” He taps the paper cover, then lifts it away, revealing that the glass has changed to a coffee cup.</p>
<div class="illustype_image"><div class="image"><img alt="e9780486156637_i0062.jpg" src="images/e9780486156637_i0062.jpg"/></div>

<p class="p-indent">The coffee cup is in the lap at the start. The coins are covered with the newspaper-wrapped glass. Bring the wrapped glass back to the edge of the table. While attention is on the coins, release the glass, allowing it to fall into the waiting right hand. Silently place the glass on the lap.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Cover the coins again. Recite a few mystic words. Lift the paper cover, bringing it to the near edge of the table. As you do, place it directly over the coffee cup, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c03.html#int_59" id="ref_int_59">Figure 58</a>. Place the paper-wrapped cup on top of the coins.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Tap the paper, then lift it away to reveal that the glass has apparently changed to a coffee cup.</p>
<p class="p-indent">In a similar way you can cause the glass to change to a smaller glass, a ball or other small object.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title25"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">21. RUB A DUB</span></h1>
<p class="p">The magician places a half-dollar on a cloth-covered table. He rubs the coin with a circular motion. The coin is rubbed right through the center of the table.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> Place a half-dollar on the table about 10” from the near edge. The table should be covered with a tablecloth. Cover the coin with the left hand, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c03.html#int_60" id="ref_int_60">Figure 59</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Move the hand forward, beginning a circular motion as indicated by the arrow in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c03.html#int_60">Figure 59</a>. But as the hand moves forward, it lifts slightly away from the coin, leaving the coin on the table. When the hand reaches the center of the table, the coin is concealed under the wrist, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c03.html#int_61" id="ref_int_61">Figure 60</a>.</p>

But this time, bear down on the coin so that as the hand moves back toward the near edge of the table, the coin slides back also.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Proceed in a similar manner, leaving the coin in place as the hand moves forward, drawing it back as the hand moves back toward the near edge of the table. After two such circular sweeps, the coin will have secretly shifted to a position at the near edge of the table, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c03.html#int_62" id="ref_int_62">Figure 61</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">On the next sweep, allow the coin to fall silently into the lap. Then place the right hand in the lap, pick up the coin and bring the coin to the center of the table. <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c03.html#int_63" id="ref_int_63">Figure 62</a> shows the situation at this point. The coin is in the right hand. The audience thinks the coin is under the left hand.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Tap the left hand against the center of the table. At the same time, tap the coin up against the tabletop from below with the right hand. Synchronize the motions so it appears the tapping sound is made by the coin under the left palm.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Slap the left hand against the tabletop. Then lift it away to show that the coin has vanished. Bring the right hand out holding the coin.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Ross Bertram suggested for patter a line about using the circular rubbing motion to polish silver coins. After the left hand has been lifted to show the coin gone, the performer remarks, “Looks like I rubbed too hard.”</p>

Then tip the mouth of the glass toward the right hand, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c03.html#int_66" id="ref_int_66">Figure 65</a>. The coin inside will make a clinking sound. As soon as it does, close the right hand into a fist as if the coin was poured into the right hand.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Place the glass down. You will note the coin tipped out of the glass and now lies in a cloth bag made from the slack in the handkerchief. The situation is shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c03.html#int_67" id="ref_int_67">Figure 66</a>. The glass is placed on the table so the portion with the coin is away from the audience.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Show the left hand empty. Pick up a ball of wool from the table with the left hand. In the center of the ball of wool is a duplicate coin, placed there before the performance.</p>
<p class="p-indent">With the right hand, make a tossing motion toward the ball of wool. Open the right hand to show it empty. Then grasp the handkerchief with the right hand, secretly pinching the coin so it is held in place. Gently lift the handkerchief away from the glass. Place the handkerchief in the pocket.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Have a spectator hold the ball of wool in his cupped hands. Unravel the wool to reveal the coin.</p></div></div>
