<a id="title67"/><h1 class="title-chapter"><span class="b">PREPARED TRICKS</span></h1>
<p class="p">Coins and bills are used in money transactions of everyday life. Because they are common objects, they are not suspected of being prepared or gimmicked. This is an advantage for the magician because he can perform strong magic with the aid of prepared coins or bills.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When putting together a routine of several money tricks, it is acceptable to include one or two prepared tricks of the kind described in this chapter. If too many such tricks are performed at the same time, the audience cannot help but note that the apparatus is acting with exceptional strangeness, and they will conclude that unseen aids are at work. But when properly chosen and strategically placed, prepared tricks can elevate a magic act to the miracle class.</p>
<div class="section1"><a id="title68"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">60. HALF AND HALF</span></h1>
<p class="p">Ideas of Jimmy Herpick and Louis Tannen are combined to produce this novel trick. A borrowed dollar bill is placed in an envelope. The spectator initials the flap of the envelope to avoid the suspicion of a switch. While the magician holds the ends of the envelope, the spectator cuts the envelope in half. The bill has now been cut in halves. When the performer shakes out the two halves of the bill, they have changed to half-dollars.</p>

<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> Two envelopes are prepared beforehand. Trim off the flap from one envelope (envelope <span class="i">A</span> in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c07.html#int_139" id="ref_int_139">Figure 137</a>). Place two half-dollars into another envelope (envelope <span class="i">B</span> in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c07.html#int_139">Figure 137</a>). One half-dollar is on each side of the envelope.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Place envelope <span class="i">A</span> on top of envelope <span class="i">B.</span> Then place these two prepared envelopes on top of four or five envelopes. This stack of envelopes can be carried in the pocket until you are ready to perform.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Borrow a dollar bill. Slide it into envelope <span class="i">A</span> until all but about a half-inch of the bill is inside the envelope. The situation is shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c07.html#int_140" id="ref_int_140">Figure 138</a>. Have the spectator write his initials on the inside of the flap. Unknown to him, the uppermost flap is really that of envelope <span class="i">B.</span> The protruding bill hides the fact that envelope <span class="i">A</span> has no flap.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When the spectator has signed his initials on the flap, push the dollar bill all the way into envelope <span class="i">A.</span> Grasp the flap of envelope <span class="i">B</span> and pull this envelope upward, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c07.html#int_141" id="ref_int_141">Figure 139</a>.</p>

<p class="p-indent">Place the other envelopes in the pocket. Seal the flap of envelope <span class="i">B</span>. Hold the envelope as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c07.html#int_142" id="ref_int_142">Figure 140</a>, so that each hand holds a coin in place.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Have the spectator cut the envelope in half, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c07.html#int_142">Figure 140</a>. Remark that the bill has been cut in halves. Then allow the half-dollars to fall out onto the table.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title69"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">61. TWO COINS</span></h1>
<p class="p">Two coins, covered with playing cards, behave in increasingly strange ways. In one effect, each coin is covered with a playing card. With no moves, one coin vanishes and appears under the other card. In another effect, one coin mysteriously clings to the bottom of a playing card, then drops to join the other coin.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> Two nickels are joined by a piece of fine thread, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c07.html#int_143" id="ref_int_143">Figure 141</a>. The thread is taped to the bottom of each coin. The thread should be about 1½″ long.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Start with the nickels in the pocket along with some loose change. Remove a handful of change, pick out the prepared set of nickels and place them on the table. The taped sides of the coins are on the bottom and thus out of the spectator’s view.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Cover one of the nickels with a playing card, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c07.html#int_144" id="ref_int_144">Figure 142</a>. As the right hand picks up the other card, the left hand slides the visible nickel forward, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c07.html#int_145" id="ref_int_145">Figure 143</a>. Unknown to the audience, as the visible nickel is slid forward, the other nickel is secretly stolen out from under its card. The stolen nickel is hidden by the left wrist.</p>
<div class="illustype_image"><div class="image"><img alt="e9780486156637_i0148.jpg" src="images/e9780486156637_i0148.jpg"/></div>

<p class="p-indent">The right hand drops its playing card on top of the visible nickel, at the same time covering the other nickel as well. Snap your fingers, pick up the first card and show that the coin has vanished. Then pick up the other card to show both nickels.</p>
<p class="p-indent">For the repeat, place the nickels side by side as indicated in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c07.html#int_146" id="ref_int_146">Figure 144</a>. Cover the nickel on the right with a card. The left first finger pushes the visible coin up and around to a position in front of the card, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c07.html#int_146">Figure 144</a>. This simple maneuver helps strengthen the illusion that the coins are not connected.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The right hand picks up the other card and, as indicated in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c07.html#int_147" id="ref_int_147">Figure 145</a>, uses the card to slide the visible coin forward. Again the other coin is secretly stolen; when you drop the card onto the visible coin, the card actually rests on top of <span class="i">both</span> coins.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Snap your fingers over the first card, lift it and show that the coin has vanished. Then lift the other card to reveal both coins.</p>

<p class="p-indent">The trick can be repeated one more time with a different handling. Place the two nickels on the table, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c07.html#int_143">Figure 141</a>. Place a card over the lower nickel with the left hand. Grip the card between the thumb and first finger. Do not release your grip on the card.</p>
<p class="p-indent">With the right hand cover the visible nickel. As this is done, the left second finger drags its coin back under cover of the card still held by the left hand. The position of the hands when the steal is made is shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c07.html#int_148" id="ref_int_148">Figure 146</a>. The result is that both coins will lie under the lower card. With this move, note that the steal is made without visibly moving either coin.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The right hand continues its forward motion and drops its card on what is apparently the other coin. Snap the fingers. Then show that both nickels are under the lower card.</p>
<p class="p-indent">For the final trick, place the two nickels side by side. Cover the rightmost nickel with a card. Then slide the other nickel to the left, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c07.html#int_149" id="ref_int_149">Figure 147</a>. As before, the nickel under the right card is secretly stolen and is now under the card on the left.</p>
<p class="p-indent">With the left hand, place the leftmost coin on top of its playing card. The card has a coin under it and one over it at this point.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Wave the hand over the rightmost card. Gently lift this card off the table about two or three inches. Remark that the nickel will cling mysteriously to the bottom of this card. Bring this card over the other card, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c07.html#int_150" id="ref_int_150">Figure 148</a>. Lower it gently. When it touches the visible coin, pull the leftmost card away with a quick action. The two coins will clink against one another. Turn both cards over and toss them out onto the table. Scoop up the coins and return them to the pocket.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The above routine uses ideas of Mort Rudnick, Harvey Rosenthal, John Bowery and the author. If you find the thread has a tendency to show up on the table, perform the trick with a newspaper or magazine as a working surface.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title70"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">62. POROUS COIN</span></h1>
<p class="p">A borrowed coin is wrapped in a piece of newspaper. A needle or hatpin is repeatedly pushed through the coin. At the finish the borrowed coin is returned undamaged to the spectator.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> This trick uses a coin fold invented by H. G. A. Lambie. Use a square of newspaper from the classified pages. It should measure 5½″ square. Fold it in thirds each way and then unfold it.</p>
<p class="p-indent">A strip of newspaper 5½″ long and 1<span class="imageinline"><img alt="e9780486156637_img_8542.gif" src="images/e9780486156637_img_8542.gif"/></span>″ wide is then glued to the bottom third of the large square. Glue is applied to the end sections shown shaded in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c07.html#int_151" id="ref_int_151">Figure 149</a>. The result is that a center pocket is formed through which the coin can slide. Turn the apparatus over side for side.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Fold the bottom third up onto the center. Then place a borrowed quarter into the secret pocket, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c07.html#int_152" id="ref_int_152">Figure 150</a>. Show the coin apparently being placed on the center square of the paper. It is a perfect illusion.</p>

<p class="p-indent">Fold the top third down. Then fold the left third over to the right and the right third over to the left. The coin is apparently trapped inside the folded paper.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Grasp the folded newspaper with the left hand. The right hand removes a needle or hatpin from the lapel or from the pocket. The point of the needle is pushed against the center of the paper. At the same time, the left hand releases pressure, allowing the coin to slide down to the position shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c07.html#int_153" id="ref_int_153">Figure 151</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">This allows the needle to penetrate the center of the paper and, apparently, the center of the coin. Repeat this penetration a few more times. Then replace the hatpin in the pocket. Tear off the top of the newspaper and dump the coin out undamaged. Place the newspaper in the pocket.</p></div>

<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> Two opaque flat-bottomed paper drinking cups are used. They should measure at least 5” in height. This ensures that the spectator cannot look down into the cups and spot the secret.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Cut the bottom from one cup. Slide a dime into the other cup so the dime rests against the side of the cup. This is shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c07.html#int_166" id="ref_int_166">Figure 164</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Nest the bottomless cup in the other cup. The dime is now trapped between the two cups. Drop four half-dollars into the nested cups.</p>
<p class="p-indent">To present the routine, tip the nested cups over to allow the four half-dollars to fall out. As you do this, say, “There are four half-dollars in this cup.” The dime is still trapped between the cups, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c07.html#int_167" id="ref_int_167">Figure 165</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Straighten up the cups. Remove the bottomless cup and place it on the table. Then say, “And a mystic dime in this cup.” Now tip the unprepared cup over and allow the dime to fall out. Because different coins seem to come from different cups, it appears as if the two cups are unprepared.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Nest the bottomless cup in the unprepared cup. Then arrange all coins heads up on the table. Say, “This dime was given to me by a magician who said it had mystic powers.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Pick up two half-dollars and drop them, one at a time, into the nested cups. Grip the nested cups from above with the palm-down left hand. Lift the two cups slightly off the table. Grip the unprepared cup near its base with the right hand.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The left hand removes the bottomless cup and places it down to the right, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c07.html#int_168" id="ref_int_168">Figure 166</a>. At the same time, the right hand taps its cup against the table just hard enough to cause the coins inside to clink. Synchronize the sound so it is produced just as the bottomless cup touches the table. This produces the illusion that the sound comes from the coins that are supposed to be in the bottomless cup.</p>

<p class="p-indent">Place the right hand palm up in the lap. Place the unprepared cup in the right palm. The left hand then picks up the two half-dollars on the table and apparently drops them into this cup.

Pick up the dime, saying, “The mystic dime casts the spell.” Drop the dime into the cup.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Place the cup under the table. Pause, then say, “The dime isn’t quite ready.” Take the unprepared cup with the left hand and empty the contents onto the table. The audience sees two half-dollars and the dime, so all appears honest. The right hand remains under the table. Unknown to the audience, there are two half-dollars in the right hand.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Drop the two half-dollars and the dime into the unprepared cup.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The cup is placed in the lap, but really is held between the knees. The left hand is then placed palm down on top of the bottomless cup. Command the coins to leave this cup.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Drop one coin from the right hand into the cup that is on the lap. Pause a moment, then drop the other coin into the cup.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Shake the bottomless cup with the left hand to demonstrate it is empty. At the same time bring the other cup into view. Tip it over to allow the four half-dollars and the dime to fall to the table.</p></div>

<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> Inexpensive imitation-leather change purses are available in department stores. Two are needed for this trick.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Open one of the purses. With a pair of scissors cut a slit in one side. The slit should be wide enough for a coin to fall through easily. Open the other purse. Place three copper pennies into this purse. Close the purse and turn it over. Shake this purse so the three pennies gather at the top near a corner. Place the purse in the pocket in this inverted condition.</p>
<p class="p-indent">A handful of dimes and pennies are placed on a saucer. This completes the preparation.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When presenting the trick, pick up the purse that has a slit in it. Hold the purse so the side with the slit is toward you and therefore concealed from audience view.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Display the saucer of coins. Place it on the table in front of you. The purse with the slit is rested on the saucer.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Pick up a dime, show it and drop it into the purse. Do the same with two more dimes.

Do the same thing with two more pennies. (If you find the sounds made by the pennies when they hit the plate are louder than they would be if the pennies were actually placed in the purse, you can place a folded paper napkin or handkerchief on the plate to lessen the sound of the falling coins.)</p>

<p class="p">Two playing cards are shown and placed on the table. The magician places a dime and a penny under the table. The two coins mysteriously penetrate up through the table and appear under the cards. When the coins are covered by the cards, the coins penetrate down through the table.</p>
<p class="p-indent">This routine is based on an idea of the British magician Alex Elmsley.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> One end of a short length of fine thread is glued between a dime and a penny. The thread is sandwiched between the coins, and the coins are glued offset. The other end of the thread is taped or glued to the center of the back of any ace, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c07.html#int_172" id="ref_int_172">Figure 170</a>.

The length of thread between the cards and coins should be about half the width of a playing card. Also needed is any 10-spot from the deck.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The two coins hang in back of the ace. The 10-spot is placed in back of the coins so the coins are between the cards. In this condition the apparatus is placed in the pocket.</p>
<p class="p-indent">If the reader wishes to try out the routine on an informal basis, one end of the thread can be taped to the back of a playing card and the other end taped to a penny or a dollar bill folded in eighths and pressed flat.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Remove the apparatus from the pocket and hold the cards upright as indicated in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c07.html#int_174" id="ref_int_174">Figure 172</a>.

<p class="p">A $10 bill is wrapped in a piece of paper. A pencil is pushed through the paper and bill, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c07.html#int_180" id="ref_int_180">Figure 178</a>. The apparatus is shown on both sides. There is no doubt the pencil has torn through the paper and the bill.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When the apparatus is unfolded, it is found that, although the paper has a hole in the center, the bill has restored itself, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c07.html#int_181" id="ref_int_181">Figure 179</a>.</p>

<p class="p"><span class="i">Method:</span> This ingenious trick is based on ideas of Murray Sumner, Rick Johnsson and Yoshio Hirose. To prepare, cut a slit near the right side of a play-money $10 bill, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c07.html#int_182" id="ref_int_182">Figure 180</a>. The slit should be about ½″ long. This is the extent of the preparation. The bill may be carried in the wallet.</p>

<p class="p-indent">A piece of plain white paper the size of a bill is also required. Place the prepared bill against the paper, with the bill offset about ½″ forward as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c07.html#int_183" id="ref_int_183">Figure 181</a>. The left thumb covers the slit in the bill.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Fold the apparatus in half toward you so the bill is on the inside. The ends are slightly offset as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c07.html#int_184" id="ref_int_184">Figure 182</a>. Openly insert the point of the pencil between the folds of the bill. Unknown to the audience, the pencil point is actually worked through the slit in the bill. This is shown in the exposed view of <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c07.html#int_185" id="ref_int_185">Figure 183</a>. Thus the pencil really slides behind the bill.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Continue pushing the pencil forward until it penetrates the center of the paper. When the apparatus is as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c07.html#int_180">Figure 178</a>, display it on both sides. It seems beyond doubt that the pencil has torn through the center of the bill.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Remove the pencil. Then open out the apparatus with the paper facing the spectators. From your view the apparatus looks like <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c07.html#int_183">Figure 181</a>. Take the paper in the left hand, the bill in the right, <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156637_c07.html#int_181">Figure 179</a>, to reveal that, while there is a hole in the paper, the bill is undamaged. Return the bill to the wallet.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Save this trick for special occasions. It is an impossible-seeming effect that brings gasps of disbelief from spectators.</p></div></div>
