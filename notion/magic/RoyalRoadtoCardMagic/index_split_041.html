<p class="calibre_2"><strong class="calibre11"><span class="calibre8">Planning a Card Trick Routine</span></strong></p>
<p class="calibre_3">When the neophyte has mastered several tricks, he is faced with the necessity of creating a routine with them, that is to say, arranging them in the best possible order so that the fullest effect can be drawn from each feat and so that they will follow one another smoothly without any hesitation or delay. This programming of tricks is most important. If one relies solely on knowing a number of separate tricks, all too often one's mind goes blank after a trick or two before an audience. This is true even with advanced conjurors. A floundering attempt is then made to recall some simple feat, and instead of arriving at a triumphant climax one has to close ignominiously.</p>
<p class="calibre_3">To avoid such a disaster, the only plan is to arrange one's tricks in a certain sequence, so that, having started with one trick, the rest follow automatically with no effort of memory whatever. Roughly the plan should be to start with a good trick, one that arouses interest at the very beginning, continue with tricks the effects of which are on an ascending scale of interest, and finish with the strongest effect of the series.</p>
<p class="calibre_3">In using the word mastered in the first sentence of this chapter, we mean that the student has his tricks literally at his fingertips and that he can do them at a moment's notice, anywhere and with any pack that may be handed to him. This is the only way in which to get complete satisfaction from performing and to give complete satisfaction to your audiences. Make up your mind at once that it is better to know a few tricks thoroughly than it is to half-know several dozen.</p>
<p class="calibre_3">Let us suppose that the conditions are that you are called upon to entertain a small group and that a pack of cards has been handed to your. Begin with:</p>
<p class="calibre_3"><strong class="calibre11">Topsy-turvy Cards<br class="calibre6"/>
</strong>Introduce the trick with some remark about testing the cards to see if they have been well trained. Finding that the cards are satisfactory, continue with:</p>
<p class="calibre_3"><strong class="calibre11">Now You See It!<br class="calibre6"/>
</strong>This is a 'mistake' trick, in which it appears that you cannot complete your trick successfully and yet at the last moment you turn the tables and finish triumphantly. It is a good trick, because it gives you a psychological advantage over your audience. At first those present think you are a hopeless dud with cards and they feel a little sorry for you. When you seem to be in the deepest trouble and they feel most sympathetic, you startle them by showing that you have had command of the situation from the start. The climax is amazing and causes laughter and bewilderment. The trick can be performed in about two minutes, and this is important, because the first tricks should be quick and good.</p>
<p class="calibre_3">The trick is a good one for another reason. While performing it, you prepare for the next in your routine, in this manner. While searching for the spectator's card in step 9, move the cards around and, in doing this, place any nine-spot at the ninth position from the top, with the four aces immediately following it. In this manner, while doing one trick, you prepare for the next, which is:</p>
<p class="calibre_3"><strong class="calibre11">Obliging Aces<br class="calibre6"/>
</strong>This is a trick which seems to call for great skill. In performing it, you convince those present that you have genuine ability. When finished, thrust the four aces into the pack and hand it for shuffling. Next, you perform:</p>
<p class="calibre_3"><strong class="calibre11">Do As I Do<br class="calibre6"/>
</strong>Your audience is now watching attentively for sleight of hand, hence you make a change of pace and instead perform a self-working feat which requires no skill but has a tremendous effect. You follow this with:</p>
<p class="calibre_3"><strong class="calibre11">Card in the Pocket</strong><br class="calibre6"/> Here you change the <em class="calibre7">type</em> of trick, performing a pseudo-mind reading feat, which you follow with:</p>
<p class="calibre_3"><strong class="calibre11">Three Cards Across</strong><br class="calibre6"/> This concludes the routine with a fine trick that to the audience is the most surprising feat of all those you have performed.</p>
<p class="calibre_3">A routine of card tricks that may serve one person admirably may not be nearly so effective in the hands of another, because the personality of a performer has much to do with the entertainment value which is got from the routine.</p>
<p class="calibre_3">As you perform the tricks given you in this book, you will find that you enjoy performing some of them more than others, and usually you will get a stronger audience reaction from these tricks. You should remember the ones from which you get the most effect and use these in building your routines. You should also try to remember any amusing byplay or incidents that happen, so that you can keep these in your presentation. You will find that the more you perform a trick the better your presentation will be, for a good presentation grows, like Topsy, as you incorporate these extemporaneous bits of business in your routine.</p>
<p class="calibre_3">The building of a routine is one of the most fascinating aspects of doing magic with cards. The clever performer always considers his tricks from the viewpoint of the audience and strives to make them more and more entertaining. Your talk or patter is an integral part of the routine and should be given as much thought as the mechanics of the trick. In some of the tricks in this book we have sketchily indicated a suitable patter, but if possible you should contrive your own talk, which will then be in keeping with your personality. You will find that as you perform your tricks you will make amusing or charismatic remarks extemporaneously, and you should remember the bits of byplay we have mentioned.</p>
<p class="calibre_3">In constructing your patter, which will follow the plot line of your trick, be careful not to be verbose. The student often feels that he must talk interminably, and this becomes boring. You will know quickly enough if what you are saying is effective. If it is not, rewrite your patter. If you are talking too much and your audience looks unhappy, cut your patter mercilessly. If you have attempted to be humorous and no one laughs, throw out what you thought were the jokes and find others that are really amusing or witty. It is only by self-criticism that you will perfect and smooth your talk.</p>
<p class="calibre_3">The plot line of a trick is usually indicated by the trick itself. In devising your presentation, you should apply the laws of interest. If you say 'Let me show you a card trick,' you have not necessarily succeeded in arousing interest. But you could say 'You have, no doubt, heard of the lie detector, the complicated machine that science has devised to determine if a person is lying or telling the truth. Well, this pack of cards is my lie detector, and I'd like to show you how it operates.' If you make some such introductory statement, you have aroused the curiosity of everyone present. Even so simple a statement as 'This is a trick that Paul Daniels has used for many years,' will arouse interest, because most people have heard of him and their reaction is, 'If this trick was so good that Paul Daniels used it, it must be worth watching.' Your patter thereafter will follow the plot line that you have suggested in your opening statement.</p>
<p class="calibre_3">It may be wise to tell you at this time that you cannot gauge the effect of a trick accurately when you perform for your family or intimate friends. They know you too well. They will either tell you that you are wonderful or that you are not very good, and neither may be the exact truth. To determine the value of a trick and its presentation, perform it for strangers.</p>
<p class="calibre_3">Construct your routines so that they can be performed in from ten to fifteen minutes. You will build a number of them, using different types of tricks - those performed at the table, those for use when standing and surrounded by people, and so on - and by limiting them to fifteen minutes at the most you will be sure that you do not monopolise a gathering. If, when you have finished a routine, your audience clamours for more, you have only to perform one of the other routines.</p>
<p class="calibre_2"><strong class="calibre11"><span class="calibre8">A Table Routine</span></strong></p>
<p class="calibre_3">This routine is designed for use on occasions when an intimate group is being entertained at the table.</p>
<p class="calibre_3">Beforehand, have the four aces on the top of the pack, the pack in its case and the case in your pocket. For your first trick perform:</p>
<p class="calibre_3"><strong class="calibre11">A Poker Player's Picnic</strong><br class="calibre6"/> Take out the pack and shuffle it thoroughly by the overhand method, retaining the aces on the top, and finally cut the cards by means of the palm cut. Place the pack before a spectator and proceed with the trick.</p>
<p class="calibre_3">At the end of this feat you have four piles of cards with an ace face upwards on top of each. Turn the aces face downwards. For the next trick you require the aces to be on the top of the pack. Place them there secretly as follows.</p>
<p class="calibre_3">1. Pick up packet A and place it in your left hand in the position for an overhand shuffle. Pick up packet B and with it begin an overhand shuffle by running one card (the ace) on to packet A. Jog the next card and shuffle off freely. Undercut to the jogged card and throw on top. You have two aces together on top of the cards you hold.</p>
<p class="calibre_3">2. Pick up packet C. Repeat the same shuffle to bring the three aces together, but this time finish the shuffle by using the break, shuffle off and throw, bringing the three aces to the top of the cards you hold.</p>
<p class="calibre_3">3. Take the last packet, D, and control its ace in the same way. Finally execute the lift shuffle with the whole deck, then cut the pack, using the palm cut.</p>
<p class="calibre_3">Having thus assembled the four aces secretly at the top of the deck, proceed to the next trick:</p>
<p class="calibre_3"><strong class="calibre11">A Poker Puzzle<br class="calibre6"/>
</strong>At its finish, gather up the cards of the hand just exposed and also the fifth hand which was dealt to yourself. Three poker hands of five cards each remain on the table. Use these to introduce the following trick:</p>
<p class="calibre_3"><strong class="calibre11">Good Luck Card<br class="calibre6"/>
</strong>The student should have no difficulty in presenting these three tricks effectively. The collection of the four aces from the top of the four packets should be done in a casual manner, without looking at the cards while shuffling them and telling the audience about the trick you are about to do.</p>
<p class="calibre_2"><strong class="calibre11"><span class="calibre8">A Rollicking Routine</span></strong></p>
<p class="calibre_3">This is a fast-moving routine in which the cards jump about, change and generally perform in a rollicking manner.</p>
<p class="calibre_3">Hand the pack to someone and have them shuffle it.</p>
<p class="calibre_3"><strong class="calibre11">Rapid Transit<br class="calibre6"/>
</strong>'Let's see how the cards are behaving tonight,' you say as you take the pack. 'I'll place the top card, the ace of hearts, on the table. The next card is - let's see, it's the ten of clubs. I'll place the ten of clubs over here. Watch it closely. I'll replace the ace of hearts on the pack while you watch that ten of clubs. Now we'll see if the pack is in a good mood tonight, for if it is I shall have the ten of clubs at the top of the pack and you will have the ace of hearts on the table. Yes, the pack is full of tricks tonight. I feel emboldened to try a most difficult feat ...'</p>
<p class="calibre_3"><strong class="calibre11">The Piano Trick</strong><br class="calibre6"/> At the conclusion of this trick, continue with:</p>
<p class="calibre_3"><strong class="calibre11">Leapfrog</strong><br class="calibre6"/> 'The cards are certainly in high spirits tonight. Let's see what else they have to offer. Here, will you take a card, and you, too?' Have two spectators each remove a card and, when they have been replaced, control them to the top by means of the overhand lift shuffle. Casually run the top card to the bottom as if about to shuffle again overhand, change your mind and make a riffle shuffle, retaining the bottom card (the second selected card) and the top card (the first selected card) in position.</p>
<p class="calibre_3">Key undercut one-third of the deck and work this trick.</p>
<p class="calibre_3">'My cards are athletic, aren't they?'</p>
<p class="calibre_3"><strong class="calibre11">A Vested Interest<br class="calibre6"/>
</strong>Gather the scattered cards and place them under the packet in your left hand, thus retaining the first selected card on the top of the pack. Shuffle, retaining the first card in position, and for the finale work this trick.</p>
<p class="calibre_3">The opening trick is an intriguing one, and the two discoveries smartly worked are most effective.</p>
<p class="calibre_2"><strong class="calibre11"><span class="calibre8">Card-Discovery Routine</span></strong></p>
<p class="calibre_3">Hand the deck for shuffling and, when it has been returned to you, ribbon spread the cards on the table, turn them over and gather them with a sweep. 'So far, so good!' you comment. Spring the cards from hand to hand. 'Better and better!' Perform the Charlier cut. 'A perfect pack. I think it will give surprising results.'</p>
<p class="calibre_3"><strong class="calibre11">A Tipsy Trick</strong><br class="calibre6"/> Present this amusing trick as described in the chapter on reverses.</p>
<p class="calibre_3"><strong class="calibre11">Double Speller<br class="calibre6"/>
</strong>'I doubt if anything like that could happen tonight in the present company,' you continue. 'Still, one never knows how the cards will act.' Spread the cards with a flourish, saying, 'Will you take a card, sir? And you? And you too, sir? The more the merrier.' After the cards have been shown to everyone, begin a lift shuffle and, having shuffled about one-third of the pack, throw the lifted packet on to the cards in your left hand and have the third spectator's card placed on top. Continue the shuffle by jogging the first card and shuffling off.</p>
<p class="calibre_3">Form a break at the jog and repeat exactly the same procedure with the second person's card, then finally do the same with the third person's card. You have all three cards on the top of the pack in the order of their selection.</p>
<p class="calibre_3">Shuffle once more, placing one card above the three chosen cards on the top of the pack.</p>
<p class="calibre_3">Perform this trick as described in the chapter on the pass. When the first spectator finds his card reversed in the pack, the other two chosen cards will be second and third under the reversed card at the top of the packet remaining in his hands. Take this packet from him, drop it on the dealt cards and square the deck. Bury the reversed card and the one under it in the centre.</p>
<p class="calibre_3"><strong class="calibre11">Pinkie Does It<br class="calibre6"/>
</strong>Shuffle again, using the lift shuffle, then execute a riffle shuffle and finally the palm cut, retaining the two cards in position at the top. Perform the rising card trick exactly as explained in the chapter on tricks with the overhand shuffle, and at the conclusion allow the second spectator to withdraw his card himself.</p>
<p class="calibre_3"><strong class="calibre11">A Smash Finish<br class="calibre6"/>
</strong>You are now left with the third spectator's card at the top of the pack. Overhand shuffle, taking it to the bottom and back to the top. Palm the card in your right hand and hand the deck to be shuffled by someone on your left, and thereby sighting the card.</p>
<p class="calibre_3">When the spectator has shuffled to his satisfaction, instruct him to hold the deck in his left hand by one end. No matter how he holds it, remove the pack with your right hand and place it in your left, secretly adding the palmed card.</p>
<p class="calibre_3">Take hold of his left hand and turn it palm upwards, then place the pack face upwards on it, so that he can grip the cards between his thumb near the inner end of the deck, on the face, and his fingers on the back of the deck extending about half its length. Instruct him to take a firm hold of the cards.</p>
<p class="calibre_3">Turn to the person who selected the third card. Ask him to hold out his right hand, and say, 'In taking your card the tips of your fingers momentarily came in contact with its index at one end or the other. A minute impression of that index was thus left on your fingers. No, it is not visible and can only be detected by a highly sensitive sense of touch. This is much more difficult than reading the face of a card, but I shall try. Allow me.'</p>
<p class="calibre_3">Feel the tips of his fingers with your left hand, since, 'that is the more sensitive, being nearer the heart'. Announce the colour, then the value and finally the suit of his chosen card, which you previously glimpsed.</p>
<p class="calibre_3">Turn to the spectator who is holding the pack. 'Now, please hold the pack tightly.' See that he has not changed the grip, his thumb near the inner end and his fingers protruding under the pack, and suddenly strike the pack with a sharp downward blow. All the cards except the lowermost will be knocked out of his hand and scattered to the floor. Have him hold up this card and show it to everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre_3">It is the card just named, the card that was selected by the third spectator.</p>
<p class="calibre_3">We have mentioned elsewhere that it is always advisable to have several people note a selected card in order to guard against the possibility that the drawer may forget its name, misread it, or misname it in an attempt to disconcert you. There is the possibility, too, that you may perhaps have erred in some manner and lost control of the cards.</p>
<p class="calibre_3">In such a case you must never concede defeat. Let us say that you have lost control of a chosen card and now must extricate yourself from your predicament. Do it in this manner.</p>
<p class="calibre_3">1. Hold the pack in your left hand as for the colour change. Turn to the spectator, saying, 'Kindly name your card.' Place your hand over the pack and simulate the action of the colour change. When the card is named, say, 'I'll do something very surprising for you!'</p>
<p class="calibre_3">2. Pass by this spectator's card and go on to the next drawn card. While discovering it, fan through the pack, find the lost card, place it at the top of the pack, and then go back and make your discovery of the card.</p>
<p class="calibre_2"><strong class="calibre11"><span class="calibre8">Razzle-dazzle Routine</span></strong></p>
<p class="calibre_3">This short routine contains many surprises and can be performed under almost any conditions; for this reason it is excellent for impromptu use. As with all routines, you should practise it until you can go through it without watching your hands or having to stop to remember what to do next. The action should be automatic, smooth and graceful.</p>
<p class="calibre_3"><strong class="calibre11">The Sevens<br class="calibre6"/>
</strong>Since this is the opening trick of the routine, arrange the four sevens as required for the trick before your performance. When you have finished the feat, hand the pack to someone for shuffling.</p>
<p class="calibre_3"><strong class="calibre11">Righting a Wrong<br class="calibre6"/>
</strong>After performing this trick, again have someone shuffle the cards. Take the pack, glance at it, and say, 'Did you know that shuffling the cards generates electricity? Look what you've done.' Place the deck face downwards in your left hand and do the Pop-up Card flourish. Quickly place the card on the top of the pack and hold it down with your forefinger. 'You shocked that card. It's still trying to get away from me.' Remove your right hand and hold it in position for the Self-cutting Deck. 'Why, the whole pack's in a ferment,' you exclaim, shooting the lower half into your right hand. 'I don't think I'll be able to control the cards. However, I'll try. I'll use the two red aces.</p>
<p class="calibre_3"><strong class="calibre11">Acrobatic Aces<br class="calibre6"/>
</strong>Spread the cards face upwards and remove the red aces, and with them perform this trick, concluding by saying, 'As you can see, the cards have a will of iron.'</p>
<p class="calibre_2"><strong class="calibre11"><span class="calibre8">Top-Change Byplay</span></strong></p>
<p class="calibre_3">Shuffle the cards using the waterfall shuffle, and when the cards are squared, execute A Pretty Cut. Place the deck face upwards in your left hand, and change the face card by means of the colour change, muttering, 'The cards are absolutely uncontrollable tonight. No one knows what will happen next.'</p>
<p class="calibre_3">Fan the deck, have a card removed and noted by all, and proceed into the top-change byplay.</p>
<p class="calibre_3">When you have extracted all the fun to be had from the trick, glance at someone and say, 'I'll read your mind. Think of a card.' Spread the cards with their faces towards yourself, find the eight of clubs, and cut it to the top of the pack. Hesitate, shake your head, and say, 'Concentrate, please.' Fan the pack, find the nine of clubs, remove it and hold it with its back to the audience, saying, 'Remember, all you did was think of this card. Kindly name it.' He names it and once in fifty-two times it should be the card you hold. On the other fifty-one occasions, glance at the card, say 'Oh' in an expressionless tone and place it at the top of the pack.</p>
<p class="calibre_3">Immediately and blandly say, 'Well, I'll do another trick for you. This time <em class="calibre7">I'll</em> think of a card and you name it. Ready? Good. Name the first card that comes to mind, and that will be my card. All right, what's the card I'm thinking of?' No matter what card he names, say, 'That's correct!' All this the audience believes to be amusing nonsense, but actually you have set up the eight and nine of clubs at the top of the pack in preparation for:</p>
<p class="calibre_3"><strong class="calibre11">Ambitious Card</strong><br class="calibre6"/> Perform the trick as given, finally finding the card under your jacket. 'You see how the cards are tonight? Can't do a thing with them!' you say, pocketing the deck.</p>
