<h1 class="Demo-Head"><span class="demo">Demonstration</span><br/>Step-by-Step Drawing</h1>
<p class="noindent">This first step-by-step sequence puts all the lessons you learned in this book into a structured procedure. Understanding how each of those steps works together is helpful when you need to analyze and break down a complex form or pose.</p>
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C5-F2.jpg"/></p>
<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">1</span> Start With an Armature</p>
<p class="SbS1">In Level 1 of this book you used an armature to clearly define a pose. An armature is great for clearly showing how the different parts of the body sit in space in relation to each other. It’s also a great tool for working out the proportions of the figure.</p>
<p class="SbS2">While an armature is useful in inventing a pose and figuring out the positions of the limbs and trunk, a gesture drawing is a far better foundation for your drawing. So draw the armature off to the side and use it as a reference.</p>
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C5-F3.jpg"/></p>
<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">2</span> Make a Gesture Drawing</p>
<p class="SbS1">A gesture captures everything that an armature does—establishing the pose and proportion of the body, for example—but it moves and flows in a more organic way. It can also capture some of the muscle shapes and connections between parts more easily than an armature. So start your drawing by capturing the gesture.</p>
<p class="SbS2">The drawing on this page is dark so you can more easily see it. At this stage, the lines should be fairly light so you can change and refine as you go. As you build the drawing, the gesture drawing will nearly disappear, but its effect will carry through to the final rendering.</p>
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C5-F4.jpg"/></p>
<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">3</span> Create Volume</p>
<p class="SbS1">Once you have a gesture drawing that captures the pose, proportion, rhythm and attitude of your model, you can then begin to develop its three-dimensional qualities.</p>
<p class="SbS2">In Level 3, you created volume by sculpting spheres, boxes and cylinders into shapes that reflect the subject. This is how to clearly define how the body sits in space.</p>
<p class="SbS2">These shapes taper, bulge, merge and connect in ways that reflect the shapes of the body, but they aren’t meant to be anatomically accurate. Their purpose is to define the figure in space and to build a solid structure where the muscles can be more clearly designed.</p>
<p class="SbS2">Creating volume in this way also gives you a three-dimensional map for working out how light falls on the figure. It’s much easier to experiment with lighting effects on simple cylinders and boxes than it is on a figure where all the muscles are defined.</p>
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C5-F5.jpg"/></p>
<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">4</span> Add Anatomy</p>
<p class="SbS1">Adding the details of anatomy to a figure requires that you know the three-dimensional shapes of the muscles and where they connect to the bones. You’ll use the same skills you honed when you learned how to draw a figure using simple volumes. But this time there are a lot more specifically shaped forms for each muscle.</p>
<p class="SbS2">A great way to keep your mind focused on the muscles is to name them as you are drawing them. This makes you think about each individual muscle and helps you keep things from getting jumbled together.</p>
<p class="SbS2">Keep in mind that you’re very rarely drawing people who are both extremely muscular and very lean. This means that the muscles will be more subtle. They will, however, still influence the surface undulations of the body. Knowing what causes one area to rise and another to fall requires that you understand how the body is built anatomically.</p>
<p class="SbS2">Some major muscles are far more visible than others. The shape of the calves, the shoulders and the chest muscles, for example, are visible on everyone, so having a solid grasp of these shapes will take you a long way toward creating a believable figure.</p>
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C5-F6.jpg"/></p>
<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">5</span> Draw a Total Figure</p>
<p class="SbS1">However you choose to finish your figure, whether it’s a drawing, a painting, pen and ink, pastels or another media, you have to keep in mind that the person you are drawing is a whole thing and not a collection of parts. You don’t want to overemphasize the anatomy and lose sight of the figure as a whole. You want the drawing to express a unified thought so that the viewer doesn’t notice the parts of your drawing but gets a feeling about the character.</p>
<p class="SbS2">Ideally, your final rendering conveys something about your subject—a mood, an attitude, a personality—and none of the parts should draw attention away from the subject as a whole.</p>
<p class="SbS2">Your end goal is to connect with your audience by evoking a feeling in them. You want your drawing to feel real enough that they stop looking at your lines and tones and see the person that you’ve depicted.</p>
