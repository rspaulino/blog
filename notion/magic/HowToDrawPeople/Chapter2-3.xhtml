<h1 class="A-head">The Cube</h1>
<p class="noindent">Like the sphere, the cube is a basic building block in art. Being able to draw a box well opens up a whole new dimension to your skill. Because the box has clearly defined edges and planes, it has a strong illusion of depth. When you see a cube shape, your mind automatically sees it in three dimensions rather than just lines on a flat surface. Artists exploit this trick of the eye to create works of art that appear to leap off the page.</p>
<p class="indent">Practice drawing boxes in a variety of shapes and sizes. Long, skinny boxes. Wide boxes. Tiny boxes. Even boxes with transparent faces so you can see the back corner that’s usually hidden. Mastering this skill takes you a long way to creating art with real depth.</p>

<p class="Caption">When drawing the cube, don’t worry about perspective or vanishing points. Every edge that faces the same direction should be drawn with parallel lines.</p>
