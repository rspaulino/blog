<p class="intro">The next step in understanding how to build a figure is to flesh it out three-dimensionally. The skeleton underpins the form, but it’s the flesh and muscle that give the body its shape.</p>
<p class="intro1">If you become adept at drawing the sphere, box and cylinder, you can bend, merge and sculpt them into any form you desire. While I’m focusing on drawing people, these skills apply to all representational drawing. You will learn to look at an object and break it down in your mind into a series of basic volumes all merged together. It doesn’t matter what your subject is—a flowerpot, a car, a kitten or a person can all be broken down into a series of simple volumes. Of course, the more you understand about what you’re drawing, the more accurately you can sculpt the shapes into what you want them to be.</p>
<p class="intro1">Cartoon characters are good examples of using simple volumes to build a subject. Mickey Mouse is largely built from bubbly spheres. SpongeBob is pretty much a box with arms and legs. Using simple volumes for cartoons not only makes them easier to draw and move but also gives them clarity and dimension. When drawing more realistically, your shapes will be more intricate, but they should still retain the clear three-dimensionality of the basic volumes.</p>
