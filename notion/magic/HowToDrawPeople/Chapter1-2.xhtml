<h1 class="A-head">Proportions</h1>
<p class="noindent">Once you’re comfortable posing an armature, you’ll need to start paying attention to getting the proportion correct. Every person is a little bit different. Some people have long legs and a short torso. Other people might have long arms or wide shoulders or a squat head, so you have a lot of leeway in drawing these things.</p>
<p class="indent">That said, the classical proportion of an adult is roughly seven and a half heads tall. The top of the head to the pubic area is four heads high. The legs are about three-and-a-half head lengths tall, but many people stretch them to a more statuesque four heads.</p>
<p class="indent">These proportions only matter when the figure is standing straight. As soon as a limb or the torso moves forward or backward, the foreshortened perspective makes the proportion seem shorter. If you’re drawing from life, the easiest way to measure distances is to visually measure the height of the head using your pencil at arm’s length. Then use that measurement to plot out the rest of the body. Eventually you’ll develop a sense of how much the proportions change when foreshortened, which will help you when you’re inventing a figure from imagination.</p>

<p class="Caption">This armature is seven and a half heads tall. The horizontal lines show where different parts of the body fall when you use the height of the head to measure the proportions. For example, you can see that from the top of the head to the bottom of the torso is four heads tall. When a limb moves away from the body or is foreshortened, you can use the head as a reference to figure out where to start and end your lines.</p>
