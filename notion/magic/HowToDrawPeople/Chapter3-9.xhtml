<p class="Assignment-HD">1| Gather Photo References</p>
<p class="SbS1">Gather the images you printed out for the armature assignment in Level 1 and with the drawings you did of the armatures.</p>
<p class="Assignment-HD">2| Draw Pose Over Photo</p>
<p class="SbS1">Using tracing paper or a light table, draw over the armatures you previously drew and re-create the pose using only simple volumes. Look at the picture carefully to see how the body is positioned while you use your armature as a foundation for your drawing. Pay particular attention to getting the forms to sit in space accurately. If a leg is kicking toward you, make sure the cylinders are clearly pointing toward you as well. If you see that something in your armature drawing isn’t accurate, correct it as you build up your new drawing.</p>
<p class="Assignment-HD">Extra Credit</p>
<p class="SbS1">Once you have analyzed a few poses on tracing paper, draw more figures using a photo as reference but don’t use anything to aid you behind your drawing. Start with a light gesture drawing and build up the simple volumes from there.</p>
