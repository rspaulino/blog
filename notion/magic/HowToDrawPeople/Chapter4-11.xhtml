<h1 class="A-head">Movement of the Arm at the Wrist</h1>
<p class="noindent">The muscles of the forearm move the wrist and fingers, and rotate the forearm so the hand faces up or down. The basic shapes you’ve been using for the forearm are either a box or cylinder shape at the elbow and a box shape for the wrist. In between, the form bulges into a spherical shape.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s easier to understand the muscles in the forearm if you break them down into their functions and treat them as one group of muscles that work together. Once you have a stronger grasp of how these muscle groups move, you can start to study the individual muscles in each group.</p>
<p class="indent">The hands don’t have many muscles in them. The majority of muscles that move the fingers are in the forearm and connect to the fingers through string-like tendons. The muscle pulls the tendons and the fingers bend.</p>
<h2 class="BHD">Forearm</h2>
<p class="noindent">One forearm muscle group, the flexors, curls the hand up at the wrist toward the forearm. The opposing group of muscles, the extensors, lifts the hand back at the wrist. The rotator group allows you to twist your wrist so that your palm faces up or down. Other muscles, such as the brachioradialis, are used to stabilize the forearm in a neutral position.</p>

<p class="Caption">Each muscle group of the forearm connects to one side of the elbow or the other. In the middle is where the biceps connect at the front or the triceps connect at the back.</p>
<p class="Caption1">The extensor group starts at the outside of the elbow and connects to the top of the hand.</p>
<p class="Caption1">The flexor group starts at the inside of the elbow and connects to the bottom of the hand.</p>
<p class="Caption1">The rotator group, which rotates the palm forward, starts near the flexor group on the elbow but connects to the radius bone about midway down.</p>
<p class="Caption1">The brachioradialis originates higher up the humerus than the rest of the extensor muscles and connects to the radius bone near the thumb.</p>

<p class="Caption">Understanding how these muscles twist around each other as the wrist turns can be challenging. This diagram depicts how the muscles twist and overlap as the arm rotates.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
<h2 class="SBHD">Exercise</h2>
<p class="SBBOD">To help visualize how the muscles move when you twist your arm, put a piece of tape or draw a line on your left arm where the muscles stretch from your elbow to your wrist. Now when you rotate your wrist, you can better visualize how the muscles twist.</p>
</div>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F82.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">This arm is in a neutral position so the muscles of the forearm aren’t twisted across the arm. The biggest muscle group on top of the forearm is the extensor group that pulls the hand back at the wrist.</p>
</div>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F83.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">Here you can see the muscles stretching across the forearm as the palm is rotated to face downward.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="BHD">Hand</h2>
<p class="noindent">In Level 3 (<a href="Chapter3-8.xhtml#page51">page 51</a>) I broke down the hand into box forms, which clearly show how the hand is sitting in space. Once you’ve established the hand’s three-dimensional form, you can start shaping it into a drawing that looks more like an actual hand.</p>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F84.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">The palm of the hand has three large masses: at the thumb, on the side of the hand and a kidney bean–shaped pad below the first knuckle of the fingers.</p>
<p class="Caption1">While proportions of the body vary from person to person, generally the middle finger is the longest. The ring and index fingers are shorter, and the pinky is the shortest. It you draw a line through all the knuckles of the fingers you’ll see the arcs. This is helpful to determining the length of the fingers when the hand is spread out.</p>
</div>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F85.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">Here you can see the relationship between the hand constructed of boxes and one that is more anatomically correct. The boxes clearly define the hand in three dimensions. You can see the angles as the fingers bend. Once you’ve established the object in space—whether you do so by actually drawing the cubes or have a clear understanding in your mind—you can pay more attention to the anatomy.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="BHD">Fingers</h2>
<p class="noindent">The bones of the finger run along the top of the finger. Below the bones are pillow-like pads. The knuckles on top of the finger gather skin into folds when the finger is extended. When the finger is bent the skin stretches taut at the knuckle and folds in on itself on the bottom of the finger.</p>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F86.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">The fingers don’t have any muscles in them. Instead they have tendons that pull the knuckles. In the top drawing, you can see the tendon that extends the finger. It rests along the top of the bones, and you can sometimes see it under the skin of people’s hands.</p>
<p class="Caption1">Below the finger are the pads of the fingers that cushion the joints and help with grip. The tendon that curls the hand is below the bone but can’t be seen.</p>
