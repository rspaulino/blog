<h1 class="A-head">Cylindrical Forms</h1>
<p class="noindent">The cylinder is a useful form in drawing. It’s a great foundation for legs, arms, fingers and a number of other things. It’s also extremely useful when trying to figure out how to draw something that is foreshortened because it’s far easier to rotate a cylinder in space and build anatomy on top of that than it is to figure out what muscles look like from a difficult perspective. The top and bottom of a straight cylinder are circles. If the bottom were facing straight toward you, all you would see would be a circle and the rest of the shape would be hidden behind it. As the cylinder pivots up or down, the circle becomes more and more oval until it becomes a straight line. Both the top and bottom circles are exactly the same shape, and they’re connected at the sides by a straight line. When you’re drawing a cylinder, go beyond the two-dimensional shapes to capture the three-dimensional form.</p>

<p class="SbS1">When a circle tips away from you, the width of the circle stays the same but the edge turning away gets shorter.</p>

<p class="SbS1">On a straight cylinder, the ellipses on both ends will be the same size and angle.</p>

<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">3</span> Bend and Move the Cylinders</p>
<p class="SbS1">Once you can draw a straight cylinder well, start molding and bending it into different shapes. Bend it into something that looks like a macaroni noodle. Twist it. Compress it. Stretch it. Give it the same treatment you did in the Sculpting Forms (<a href="Chapter3-1.xhtml">page 37</a>) and Merging Forms (<a href="Chapter3-4.xhtml">pages 40–41</a>) sections.</p>
