<h1 class="A-head">Movement of the Arm at the Elbow</h1>
<p class="noindent">The elbow pivots back and forth using the muscles of the upper arm. The biceps bend the arm and the triceps straighten it.</p>
<h2 class="BHD">Biceps</h2>
<p class="noindent">The main muscles that bend the arm at the elbow are the biceps. These two muscles make up the bulk of the front of the arm. Together, their shape is a long cylinder that bulges in the middle.</p>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F73.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">At the shoulder, the pectoralis muscle overlaps the bicep. A small muscle below the bicep (called the coracobrachialis) rotates the arm inward. The latissimus connects below that, followed by the triceps.</p>
</div>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F74.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">The biceps are two separate parallel muscles that work together to bend the arm at the elbow. In most cases, you won’t be able to see the individual muscles, which appear to be just one. One of the muscles connects to the top of the humerus and the other connects to the underside of the scapula. Both reach for and connect to the radius bone of the forearm.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="BHD">Triceps</h2>
<p class="noindent">The triceps are the major muscles on the back of the arm that extend the arm at the elbow. When flexed, the muscles together look a bit like a horseshoe that bulges in the middle. At the top of the arm they are covered by the deltoid muscle and connect to the elbow at the bottom.</p>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F75.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">There are many ways to simplify the anatomical forms. On the left, the arm is built from blocky shapes. On the right, the same pose has more anatomical forms. The long box of the upper arm is replaced by the bulging horseshoe shape of the triceps and the cylindrical form of the biceps on the far side. The blocks help to clarify how the arm sits in space, and the more rounded forms that more closely reflect the anatomy retain the dimension established with the cubes.</p>
</div>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F76.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">Three muscles form the triceps. The two most prominent ones make up the distinctive horseshoe shape of the back of the arm. One connects to the humerus and the other connects to the bottom of the scapula. They both connect to a tendon that connects to the ulna bone at the elbow.</p>
<p class="Caption1">The third tricep muscle is mostly covered by the other two, but the edges are visible near the elbow.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="BHD">Elbow</h2>
<p class="noindent">The elbow gets its shape from the bones that come together to create the hinge. The big center knob is the end of the ulna bone of the lower arm. On each side of the ulna are the two lower heads of the humerus bone.</p>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F77.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">It’s easiest to base the elbow off two overlapping cubes like you did in the Arms and Hands demonstration (<a href="Chapter3-8.xhtml">pages 48–51</a>). When the arm bends at the elbow, the ends of the bones slide around each other. If the arm is straight, then the three points of the elbow line up.</p>
</div>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F78.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">When the arm is bent, the ulna rotates downward and the three points form a triangle.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
<h2 class="SBHD">Exercise</h2>
<p class="SBBOD">Just as you did for the Kneecap exercise (<a href="Chapter4-7.xhtml#page78">page 78</a>), find some life drawing examples that you like from artists throughout history and study how they handled this area. Re-create their drawings while focusing on capturing both the anatomy and three-dimensional qualities of the arm.</p>
