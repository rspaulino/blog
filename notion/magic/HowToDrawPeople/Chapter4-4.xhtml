<h1 class="Demo-Head"><span class="demo">Demonstration</span><br/>Mouth</h1>
<p class="noindent">The mouth doesn’t have as much volume as the nose, but it’s important to think of its dimensional qualities when you draw it. Because of the teeth and muscles, the mouth area forms a saucer shape. It’s round and thickens in the middle. Don’t draw the lips as mere lines. Instead, carve the lips out of the disc shape. When you think about the mouth three-dimensionally, it makes it easier to draw at different angles and to stretch and compress the shapes to change the expression.</p>

<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">1</span> Draw a Disc</p>
<p class="SbS1">To draw a mouth, you don’t just draw the lips; you need to consider the whole mouth area. The disc-like shape of the mouth area is created both by the muscles of the mouth and the teeth and bones they rest on.</p>

<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">2</span> Draw Lips</p>
<p class="SbS1">The lips are then carved into the disc shape. The top lip faces downward and the bottom lip faces more upward. Some lips are very full and some are much more slim. The shape and size varies greatly.</p>

<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">3</span> Draw an Open Mouth</p>
<p class="SbS1">When the mouth is open, the lips spread apart and reveal the teeth. Start your drawing by elongating the disc shape. Then add the upper and lower lips.</p>

<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">4</span> Draw Mouth Expressions</p>
<p class="SbS1">The whole mouth area stretches and compresses as the persons makes expressions or speaks. Practice by making different expressions in front of a mirror. Notice how the whole mouth area moves as you pucker, smile, grimace and smirk. Sketch a few different mouth expressions.</p>

<p class="Caption">When the mouth is smiling, the lips stretch and thin. When the mouth is puckered, they squash together and push out. The three-dimensional forms of the mouth are transformed using the same principles used to manipulate simple boxes, spheres and cylinders.</p>
