<h1 class="Demo-Head"><span class="demo">Demonstration</span><br/>Chest to Hips</h1>
<p class="noindent">The torso is made up of the rib cage and the pelvis. It’s not unlike an egg connected to a box in a sack. You will use the same skills you used to merge forms to create a torso. Again, you’re not going for the actual anatomy of the torso at this point, only the basic three-dimensional shapes of the simplified body.</p>

<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">1</span> Draw the Torso and Midsection</p>
<p class="SbS1">Start with the simplified skeletal torso from the Rib Cage and Spine demonstration (<a href="Chapter2-2.xhtml">page 24</a>) and a box for the midsection.</p>
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C3-F15.jpg"/></p>
<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">2</span> Merge the Shapes</p>
<p class="SbS1">Now merge the forms. Approximate the muscles by connecting the rib cage to the hips with an abdominal sheet in front, flanks at the sides and two wide muscles on each side of the spine. You should start to see how the body is made up of simpler parts merged together into a more complex form.</p>

<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">3</span> Move the Torso</p>
<p class="SbS1">Practice twisting, bending and stretching the torso to an extreme until it starts to look anatomically impossible.</p>

<p class="Caption">Here are a couple of examples of the simple skeleton merging into a simplified torso. The skeleton is the hard structure of the body, and the muscles are the softer forms that flex and stretch as the body moves around.</p>
