<h1 class="Demo-Head"><span class="demo">Demonstration</span><br/>Neck</h1>
<p class="noindent">The neck is generally built from a cylinder. There are additional muscles that come from the jawline and attach to the neck (at the hyoid bone). The overall neck has a gentle concave curve that is obvious in profile. This curve varies from person to person and can be quite pronounced on people with poor posture.</p>
<p class="indent">Start by drawing the head using simple spheres and a gesture line for the neck. Then build up the dimensional properties by defining the edges and the planes of the head and how they sit in space. Add in the neck as a cylinder, basing it off the gesture line you established. Connect the jaw to the neck.</p>

<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">1</span> Draw the Head and Neck Shapes</p>
<p class="SbS1">Start by drawing the head. Add in a simple cylinder for the neck that connects to the back of the skull and about halfway on the underside of the jaw. Then connect the underside of the chin to the cylinder of the neck.</p>

<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">2</span> Draw the Head and Neck at an Angle</p>
<p class="SbS1">Now draw the head from a three-quarter view and add in the cylinder and area under the chin. You can square it off in the front to help define the three-dimensional qualities.</p>

<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">3</span> Move the Head</p>
<p class="SbS1">When drawing the head and neck with movement, you may want to start by drawing the head using simple spheres and a gesture line for the neck. Then you can build up the dimensional properties using simple forms. You can use the same techniques from the section on Sculpting Forms (<a href="Chapter3-1.xhtml">page 37</a>) to show the neck twisting, stretching or compressing.</p>
