<h1 class="A-head">Movement of the Upper Leg</h1>
<p class="noindent">All of the muscles that move the upper leg originate from the pelvis. Some of those muscles attach to the upper leg bone and others cross both the hip joint and the knee, and attach to the lower leg.</p>
<p class="indent">The gluteal muscles of the butt cross the hip joint and largely work to straighten the hip when it’s bent and to lift the leg behind you. The hamstrings attach to the hip below the gluteal muscles and connect to the lower leg. Because they cross two joints, they both pull the leg back and bend the knee. The quadriceps provide the opposite function of the hamstrings. They also connect from the hips to the lower leg and work to lift the leg and straighten the knee.</p>
<p class="indent">On the inside of the leg are the adductors that connect the hip to the upper leg bone and pull the leg in. Opposing them are the muscles that connect to the iliotibial tract (including the gluteus maximus and tensor fasciae latae), which connects the hip to the lower leg and moves the leg out to the side.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing what function the muscle serves is useful because when you draw a body that’s moving you’ll know which muscles are flexing and pulling and which are soft and loose. A muscle that is working will be fuller and more visible than one that is relaxed.</p>
<h2 class="BHD">Gluteus</h2>
<p class="noindent">You can see two main muscles of the butt at the surface: the gluteus maximus and gluteus medius. The maximus is the main large muscle that gives the back of the hips its shape. It connects all along the back of the pelvis near the tailbone to the upper part of the femur and to a long band (iliotibial tract) on the outside of the leg that connects below the knee at the tibia. The gluteus maximus is mainly used for straightening your leg at the hip.</p>
<p class="indent">The gluteus medius is a smaller muscle that connects all along the ridge of the pelvis bone and the top of the femur. This muscle lifts the leg to the side along with the tensor fasciae latae, which sits next to the gluteus medius, a little forward of it on the pelvis.</p>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F35.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">When standing, the hips are naturally tipped a bit forward. The gluteal muscles connect along the ridge of the pelvis and round out the shape of the bottom.</p>
</div>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F36.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">The gluteus maximus is the largest muscle of the butt. It connects to the back part of the pelvis and is fuller at the bottom. Part of it connects to the iliotibial tract at the side, but most of it connects to the femur.</p>
</div>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F37.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">The shape of the gluteus maximus is a bit like a kidney bean that’s wider at the bottom than the top. Its shape is affected both by the bulk of the muscle and the shape of the pelvis to which it attaches.</p>
<p class="Caption1">The gluteus medius is more of a wedge shape that is wider at the top and tapered down toward the iliotibial tract.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="BHD">Hamstrings</h2>
<p class="noindent">The hamstrings are a group of muscles that move the leg in a variety of ways. These muscles bend the leg at the knee, rotate the leg when the knee is bent and pull the whole leg back. To simplify this area, there are two masses that are larger at the top of the leg and reach down to connect to the lower leg on each side. The calf muscle fits in between them.</p>
<p class="indent">On the outside of the leg are the biceps femoris, vastus lateralis and vastus intermedius.</p>
<p class="indent">On the inside of the leg are the adductor magnus, semitendinosus and semimembranosus.</p>
<p class="indent">You can group these muscles into two large muscles that begin under the gluteal muscles and connect to the lower leg on each side of the calf. They are wide at the top and tapered down to the bottom.</p>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F38.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">To simplify this area you can think of the hamstrings as two muscle groups that start below the gluteal muscles of the butt and go down the length of the upper leg bone and attach to the lower leg below the knee. Their fullest point is about one-third of the way down. Think of them as a tapering cylinder with a bulge.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="BHD">Quadriceps</h2>
<p class="noindent">The four large muscles of the quadriceps are what give the front of the leg its shape. These muscles work together to lift the leg and extend the lower leg at the knee. These muscles connect to the front of the pelvis, or upper part of the femur, and to the kneecap. The kneecap is then connected to the lower leg by a ligament. The quadriceps contract and pull on the patella (kneecap), which redirects the force across the bent knee to pull on the front of the tibia. You use these muscles when jumping or kicking.</p>
<p class="indent">The big quad muscle in the middle is the rectus femoris, and it is the one that connects to the pelvis.</p>
<p class="indent">The muscle to the outside of the leg is vastus lateralis, and it connects to top of the femur.</p>
<p class="indent">The muscle on the inside is the vastus medialis, and it connects near the top of the femur on the inside.</p>
<p class="indent">The vastus intermedius is the fourth quadriceps muscle, but since it is covered by the other three muscles, it typically cannot be seen.</p>
<p class="indent">Each of these muscles is a vaguely teardrop shaped. They start narrow at the top of the leg and then widen as they go down the leg, then taper again before connecting to the patella. A ligament connects the patella to the tibia.</p>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F39.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">Here you can see how the three visible muscles of the quadriceps fit together and where each muscle is wide or narrow.</p>
</div>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F40.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">The important thing when learning the muscles of the body from an artist’s perspective is knowing the three-dimensional shapes of the muscles and how they all fit together. Notice where the muscle is fuller and where it narrows. Learn how the muscles sit next to each other in space. Also, watch how they shorten and thicken when they flex, and how they soften and stretch when they’re not.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="BHD">Adductors and Sartorius</h2>
<p class="noindent">The adductors of the leg are a series of muscles that connect from the bottom of the pelvis to the leg bones and work together to pull the leg inward (e.g., when you squeeze your knees together). They connect at various points from the upper part of the femur down to the tibia.</p>
<p class="indent">These muscles aren’t as thick at the quadriceps and are to the inside of the leg. They fill out the space between the pelvis and the quadriceps. As a group, the adductors are somewhat cone shaped with the peak of the cone near the pubic bone and the base spreading from the top of the leg to just below the knee.</p>
<p class="indent">The sartorius is a long, narrow muscle that visually divides the quadriceps and the adductors. This muscle connects to the pelvis just above the largest quadriceps muscle (rectus femoris) and curves down to connect to the tibia. The sartorius rotates the leg so the knee and foot can point out to the side.</p>
<p class="indent">On the outside of the sartorius is the quadriceps. On the inside are the adductors. The sartorius appears to be the dividing line because the adductors connect to the bone below the sartorius and quadriceps.</p>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F41.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">The three main quadriceps muscles are to the left of the sartorius. The adductors are to the right and connect to the femur behind both the sartorius and vastus medialis.</p>
</div>
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F42.jpg"/></p>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F43.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">The adductors of the leg are a series of muscles, but you should treat them as a single form for the sake of simplicity. These muscles attach to the pelvis at the pubic bone and connect all along the femur down to the tibia.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="BHD">Knee</h2>
<p class="noindent">The knee is a blocky shape because it is formed by the ends of two wide bones. The end of the femur and top of the tibia both flare out at the knee to accommodate several muscles that connect in this area.</p>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F44.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">The simplified form of the leg uses a box shape for the knee not only because it clearly shows the angle of the bend but also because the actual structure of the knee has a squarish appearance.</p>
</div>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F45.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">The bones of the knee are what give it its blocky shape. The two heads of the femur form the top of the knee. The tibia also widens out at the knee to square off the bottom of the knee. The patella sits in front of the joint. The tibia protrudes a little lower than the patella. This area is called the kneeling point.</p>
</div>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F46.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">The front of the knee doesn’t have any muscle, only bone and ligaments. The quadriceps connect to the patella, and a ligament connects the patella to the kneeling point. The dominant shapes you see when the knee is bent are the heads of the femur and tibia, the patella in the center, the muscles above the knee and the ligament below.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="BHD" id="page78">Kneecap</h2>
<p class="noindent">The kneecap is a bone that floats in front of this hinge and acts as a lever to aid the quadriceps in extending the lower leg.</p>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F47.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">The patella sits in front of the femur and tibia. When the leg bends, it doesn’t rotate up with the bone but stays in place to both protect the joint and give the quadriceps better leverage to extend the lower leg.</p>
</div>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F48.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">In the two drawings above you can see how the structure of the bones impacts the look of the knee as you’d see it on a person. The kneecap floats in front of the upper and lower leg bones.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
<h2 class="SBHD">Exercise</h2>
<p class="SBBOD">Find artwork that you like of a realistic figure drawing or painting that includes the leg. Now reverse engineer the anatomy of the leg in that pose by drawing the anatomical forms. Notice how the artist handled simplifying or emphasizing the anatomy in their work. Michelangelo’s Renaissance drawings express the anatomy differently than the Art Nouveau style of Alphonse Mucha. And both depict it differently than contemporary fine or commercial artists of today.</p>
