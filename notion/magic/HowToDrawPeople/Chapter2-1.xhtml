<h1 class="Demo-Head"><span class="demo">Demonstration</span><br/>Head and Neck</h1>
<p class="noindent">For your armature you used just a sphere to represent the head. Now you’ll get a little closer to drawing an anatomical skull by drawing a simplified head shape based on the sphere.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two parts to this simplified skull: first, the cranial area, which is a wide sphere at the back of the head. Second, the face area joined to the cranium. It can be drawn as a second oblong sphere or as a squared-off mask attached at the front. The main thing to convey is that the face area is narrower and drops down from the cranial sphere.</p>
<p class="indent">The spine connects to the skull at the bottom of the cranium, near the back, and has a gentle backward curve.</p>

<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">1</span> Draw the Cranium</p>
<p class="SbS1">Start by drawing a wide sphere for the back mass of the head.</p>
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C2-F3.jpg"/></p>
<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">2</span> Add the Face</p>
<p class="SbS1">The face drops down from the cranium and is a little longer. Add in the centerline, and add marks for the nose and mouth.</p>
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C2-F4.jpg"/></p>
<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">3</span> Add the Neck</p>
<p class="SbS1">The neck connects to the cranium just behind the jaw. Instead of the line you’d see on an armature or gesture drawing, use a cylinder to give it dimension.</p>

<p class="Caption">These heads are similar to the simple sphere heads in the Armature lesson (<a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#page10">pages 10</a>–<a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#page11">11</a>) except they are a bit closer to the real anatomical shape of the skull. The neck is now a cylindrical shape instead of just a line.</p>
