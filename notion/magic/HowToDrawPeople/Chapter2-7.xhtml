<h1 class="Demo-Head"><span class="demo">Demonstration</span><br/>Hand</h1>
<p class="noindent">The hand can be complicated to draw because the fingers move in so many different ways. To simplify the hand, you can think of it like a mitten and treat the fingers as one solid mass.</p>

<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">1</span> Draw the Palm</p>
<p class="SbS1">Start by drawing the palm as a flattened box shape that tapers out from the wrist and peaks in the middle.</p>
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C2-F25.jpg"/></p>
<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">2</span> Draw the Fingers and Thumb</p>
<p class="SbS1">Attach a similarly sized shape to the front of the palm that tapers in for the fingers. You can angle or bend the finger mass as desired. Add a thumb shape off the side of the palm.</p>

<p class="Caption">Even though youâ€™re grouping the fingers together, you can still pose your hand in a wide variety of ways and use it as a reference for your drawing.</p>

<h2 class="SBHD">Exercise</h2>
<p class="SBBOD">Stop here and grab a mitten, if you have one, or pull a short sock over your fingers on your nondrawing hand. Pose your hand in different ways and draw it using only blocky shapes.</p>
