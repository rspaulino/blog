<h1 class="Demo-Head"><span class="demo">Demonstration</span><br/>Lower Body</h1>
<p class="noindent">The torso is made up of two major masses: the rib cage and the pelvis. The rib cage is an egg-shaped form. The pelvis, when you consider both the bones and the muscles in the area, is a more squared off shape. Simplifying the forms this way makes it far easier to move the torso area around in your mind. In later chapters you’ll add the connective muscles between the two forms. For now, having a clear understanding of how these underlying structures move in relation to each other is vital to giving your figures a believable sense of dimension and allows you to pose your figures more clearly.</p>

<h2 class="SBHD">Exercise</h2>
<p class="SBBOD">Stop here and get out the images you have collected for reference during the last chapter. Focus on the head, chest and hips, and draw the underlying forms. Be sure to depict poses where the person is bending or twisting. You can start off with tracing paper, but work up to finding the underlying forms through observation. Remember to think about drawing three-dimensional forms. Draw spheres, not circles. Draw boxes, not lines.</p>

<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">1</span> Draw the Pelvis</p>
<p class="SbS1">The box does a fine job of representing the pelvic area because it clearly defines the direction, angle and tip of the hips. Don’t worry that the real-life pelvic bone doesn’t look much like a box. Once all the muscles and skin are added, the bowl shape of the pelvic bone is totally obscured. You’re not going for anatomical accuracy at this stage; you simply want to create a foundation to build a three-dimensional figure.</p>
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C2-F13.jpg"/></p>
<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">2</span> Draw the Legs</p>
<p class="SbS1">Bones of the arms and legs are long cylinders with a thicker portion at each end. The femur of the upper leg has a round head at the top that protrudes outwardly as it meets the hip. You will have to taper the box shape of the hips to fit the head of the femur in the right place. The leg bone doesn’t just drop straight down; instead it moves closer to the center at the knee where it sits atop the tibia. The tibia is flat and wide at the top and narrower at the ankle. The fibula nestles in along side the tibia and is the outside bump on our ankle.</p>
<p class="SbS2">Again, your goal isn’t anatomical accuracy but a reasonable approximation of the scaffolding that holds up the muscles. The more you study the anatomy, the more accurate the shapes will be, but I don’t want you to get caught up trying to get every detail exactly right. You’re still building your foundational skills, so practice until you get a handle on the basic shapes and forms. Don’t let perfection keep you from moving forward. You’re aiming for more than just an armature made of tubes, but you aren’t trying to illustrate a reference manual for doctors.</p>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C2-F14.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">Practice moving the legs around while also shifting the hips up or down. Also work on foreshortening the bones as they move toward or away from you.</p>

<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">3</span> Draw the Foot</p>
<p class="SbS1">This simplified foot is built in two parts. The top portion is a wedge shape that represents the thick bridge of the foot. It sits upon a long narrow box that represents the toes, heel and pads of the foot. Since it’s based on box forms, you can clearly see the volumes and angles of the foot. It looks like a blocky shoe, which is a good foundation to build more specific anatomy onto later.</p>
<div class="box">
<h2 class="SBHD">Exercise</h2>
<p class="SBBOD">Stop here and get a shoe, preferably a loafer with no laces, and use that as a general reference to draw the wedge-shaped foot. On most shoes you can clearly see the angle of the upper foot (where the laces would normally be) meeting up with the horizontal section for the toes.</p>
