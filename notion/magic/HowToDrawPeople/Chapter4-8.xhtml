<h1 class="A-head">Movement of the Foot</h1>
<p class="noindent">The muscles in the lower leg make the foot move. The largest muscles on the back of the leg are the ones that extend the foot; we use them when walking, jumping or standing. These muscles bulge about one-third of the way down the leg and narrow as they go down the leg and attach to the heel. The front of the leg has smaller, cordlike muscles that lift the foot. From the front, the leg appears to have a slight inward curve.</p>
<h2 class="BHD">Calf</h2>
<p class="noindent">The calf has two main muscles called gastrocnemius. Both of them connect the back of the femur to the heel of the foot via the Achilles tendon. The two muscles are near mirrors of each other. They bulge out on the top half of the leg where they connect to the Achilles tendon. The calf muscle on the outside of the leg bulges out a bit higher than on the inside muscle, giving the leg its visual rhythm.</p>
<p class="indent">Since the muscles in the front of the lower leg are long and slender and the calves are wide, the calves are very visible from the front.</p>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F49.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">Notice the gentle curve of the leg with the muscles in place. The muscles are long and sweeping on the outside of the leg. Also notice the widest point of the muscles is higher on the outside of the leg and lower on the inside. The bones at the ankle are just the opposite: higher on the inside and lower on the outside.</p>
</div>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F50.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">One more muscle of the calf, called the soleus, appears on the lower half of the lower leg. It is mainly covered by the two large calf muscles mentioned above, but you can see it on each side of the Achilles tendon. The soleus also works to extend the foot.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="BHD">Foot and Toes</h2>
<p class="noindent">When you began drawing the foot as part of the Level 2 Lower Body demonstration (<a href="Chapter2-4.xhtml#page29">page 29</a>), you used a simple wedge and box shape. In the Level 3 Lower Body demonstration (<a href="Chapter3-7.xhtml#page47">pages 47</a>), you shaped the wedge to look a bit like a shoe. If you soften this form further, you get something more like an actual foot.</p>
<p class="indent">Like hands, feet vary greatly between individuals. Some people’s feet are rather straight, while others curve. Some are more or less flat, while others have a tall arch. Some people have long skinny toes, while others have wide short toes. As always, when you’re drawing an individual, take note of their unique shapes and adapt your drawing to match.</p>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F51.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">When drawing toes, it’s easiest to break them down into boxes so you can clearly define the top and sides. Generally the toes are like a staircase, with the first and third segments more flat and the middle section angling down.</p>
</div>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F53.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">The toes aren’t really boxy, though. They have a rounded bone at the top and a fat pad below for cushioning. This gives the toe a more cylindrical form that is narrower at the top and wider at the bottom.</p>
</div>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F52.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">The bottom of the foot has the large round pad for the heel and a wide kidney bean–shaped pad at the front of the foot.</p>
</div>
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F54.jpg"/></p>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F55.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">The heel of the foot can be drawn as a box with soft edges. This helps to define the back of the foot, where the heel connects to the Achilles tendon, the bottom pad under the heel and the sides where it meets the top arch.</p>
</div>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F56.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">On this three-quarter back view of the leg, you can see how the skin obscures and blends the muscles together into larger shapes and forms. Each muscle contributes to the overall shape but none of them draw attention away from the appearance of the leg as a whole. For example, on the lower leg you can see the bulging calf muscles as they connect to the long Achilles tendon. That form sits above the soleus muscle, which in turn sits above the fibula bone, which is in front of the small muscles at the front of the lower leg. Each muscle is important, but one needs to flow into the next to keep the viewer’s eye moving through the drawing rather than stopping at each part.</p>
</div>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F57.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">When you draw any part of the body, you don’t just draw the outside shape that you see and then fill in the inside with muscle shapes. You have to build up the drawing from simple forms molded into anatomical forms. The contours and shading of the body is a by-product of knowing how to draw the muscles in three dimensions.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
<h2 class="SBHD">Exercise</h2>
<p class="SBBOD">Take a drawing you created of the anatomy of the leg. Now redraw that pose as you would see it with skin. Keep thinking about the three-dimensional shapes of each muscle, but instead of delineating each shape, let those underlying forms influence the rise and fall of the surface of the body.</p>
