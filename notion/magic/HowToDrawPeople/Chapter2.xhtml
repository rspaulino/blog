<h1 class="chap-title"><span class="CN">Level 2</span><br/>Simplified Skeleton</h1>
<p class="intro">Once you’ve mastered drawing the figure as an armature, you can expand on those skills to draw a simplified version of a skeleton. Think of the skeleton as the armature with more dimension. The line of the spine, the angle of the hips and shoulder and the positions of the arms are exactly the same as the armature. Now you’ll add a spherical shape for the rib cage, a modified box for the pelvic area and some bony shapes for the limbs.</p>
<p class="intro1">Remember, at this stage you don’t need to worry about the anatomical accuracy of the bones. For now, just create something that has a little more three-dimensional volume than the armature. This will give you a greater understanding of the structure below the muscles. You can, of course, study the actual bones of the skeleton if you want your drawings to be more anatomically accurate, but at this stage it’s not necessary.</p>
