<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C1-F10.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Assignment-HD">1| Gather Reference Photos</p>
<p class="SbS1">Gather several photos of people in motion. I recommend searching the Internet for images of athletes from nearly any sport or performers such as dancers, actors or acrobats. You can also find great dynamic action in movie stills, comic books and concept art for video games. Whatever piques your interest is what you should use. Print out at least ten images. (These will also be used in future exercises, so save them.)</p>
<p class="Assignment-HD">2| Trace an Armature</p>
<p class="SbS1">Place tracing paper over the image and draw an armature of the pose. Use a light table if needed.</p>
<p class="Assignment-HD">3| Draw Armatures</p>
<p class="SbS1">Once you can distill the armature from a pose by drawing on top of an image, you are ready to create armatures through observation. Use the photos you collected as references, but this time don’t draw on top of the photo. Pay close attention to the size of the head compared to the body and the lengths of the limbs. Try to render the proportions as accurately as possible.</p>
<p class="Assignment-HD">Extra Credit</p>
<p class="SbS1">Take your sketchbook to a place where people gather and try to re-create people’s poses in armature form. I recommend you go somewhere people don’t move around too much, such as a coffee shop. You can capture the poses of people standing in line, sitting at a table and interacting with other people. If you don’t want to draw in public, draw from what you see in a movie or TV show.</p>
