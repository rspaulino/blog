<h1 class="A-head">Movement of the Arm at the Shoulder</h1>
<p class="noindent">The shoulder is a complicated area because there are so many muscles that give the arm its range of motion. The shoulder muscles, the chest muscles and many of the muscles in the upper back are all there to move the arms. The deltoid muscles lift the arm to the front, side and behind. The chest muscles provide the power to lift the arm in front of you. The muscles of the back provide the power to pull your arm from an extended position back to your side and a bit behind you. The muscles connected to the scapula help you lift and lower your shoulder and rotate your arm in and out.</p>
<h2 class="BHD">Pectoralis</h2>
<p class="noindent">The pectoralis muscles are the large muscles of the chest that lift the arm in front of the body. It connects along the clavicle, the breastbone and along the ribs above the arch of the rib cage.</p>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F58.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">Remember, you’re drawing the muscles in three-dimensional form, so be sure to give it thickness so it stands out from the rib cage.</p>
</div>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F59.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">The pectoralis muscle twists as it connects to the humerus bone so that as a person raises his arm, the muscle unravels. You can see on this body’s left arm that the top part of the pectoralis is over the middle and bottom sections of muscle. When the arm is lifted, the bottom portion of the muscle is now no longer tucked under. This affects the way you draw the chest, because when the arm is at the side you can sometimes see how the muscle is layered.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="BHD">Breast</h2>
<p class="noindent">A woman’s breast sits on top of the pectoralis muscle. Each breast is not a round bubble but an object of mass and weight that is pulled by gravity. Since the rib cage is round, the breasts rest downward and to the side a bit. Just like all other anatomy, this varies from person to person.</p>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F60.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">Think of the breast as a water balloon suspended from above and resting on an angled surface.</p>
</div>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F61.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">The nipples on both men and women are round but will stretch into ovals depending on how the skin is stretched and the angle at which you’re looking at the model.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="BHD">Latissimus Dorsi</h2>
<p class="noindent">The big muscle of the lower back is the latissimus dorsi. It stretches from the back of the pelvis and tailbone and up the ribs along the spine, and it connects the arm and the back. It is the main muscle that pulls the arm down when you do a pull-up. It’s also the muscle that makes up the back wall of the armpit.</p>
<p class="indent">This muscle is thicker as it comes together at the arm and spreads out into a triangular shape as it connects along the spine and pelvis.</p>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F62.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">The latissimus dorsi is the widest muscle on the back and is what gives bodybuilders their distinctive V-shape. It connects to the upper arm and stretches around the rib cage to attach near the spine and along the pelvis. When it’s relaxed, the shape of the rib cage, the bottom of the scapula and other deeper muscles (such as the erector spinae) can usually be seen below.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="BHD">Trapezius</h2>
<p class="noindent">The trapezius is a big muscle on the upper back that moves the scapula and clavicle, which in turn moves the shoulders up, down and back.</p>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F63.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">The lower portion of the trapezius connects the spine to the scapula. When this portion of the muscle retracts, it pulls the scapula closer to the spine and down. The trapezius muscles look like a diamond-shaped kite. It is the top layer of muscle and overlaps all the other back muscles.</p>
</div>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F64.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">The upper part of the trapezius connects the neck to the outer third of the clavicle. This triangular portion of the muscle lifts the shoulders and is fairly thick.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="BHD">Serratus, Rhomboid and Scapular Region</h2>
<p class="noindent">Several muscles attach to the scapula and work to move the shoulder in various ways.</p>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F65.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">The three muscles on top of the scapula help move and stabilize the shoulder. The infraspinatus and teres minor are part of the rotator cuff and assist in rotating the arm at the shoulder. They connect to the back of the humerus and aid the latissimus in pulling the arm down. One leg of the tricep muscle also connects to the scapula and it weaves between the teres minor and teres major.</p>
</div>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F66.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">The serratus muscles connect to the bottom of the scapula and reach down like fingers along the ribs. They are what pull the scapula forward. They are completely covered by the latissimus in the back, but they can be seen from the front along the side.</p>
</div>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F67.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">The rhomboids work in conjunction with the trapezius to pull the scapula toward the spine. They add bulk to the middle of the back when they’re flexed.</p>
</div>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F68.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">Many of the muscles in the back are there to move the arm. That means that most of the muscles connect to the humerus bone or the scapula. The largest muscles are the latissimus and the trapezius, so those two muscles, along with the scapula, will have the largest influence on the shape and contours of the back. Once those are defined, you can add other muscles that are visible or simply add bulk to the back.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="BHD">Deltoid</h2>
<p class="noindent">A lot of different muscles move the arm at the shoulder, but the one most people think of when you talk about shoulder muscles is the deltoid. This muscle is divided into three parts and is responsible for lifting the arm to the front, side and back. In the Arms and Hands demonstration (<a href="Chapter3-8.xhtml">pages 48–51</a>), you drew the deltoid as a wedge wrapped around a cylindrical arm. The deltoid connects along the clavicle in front and to the ridge of the scapula on the side and back. This muscle connects to the outside of the arm about halfway down the humerus.</p>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F69.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">The deltoid is somewhat of a teardrop shape with the largest bulk at the top.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="BHD">Muscle Overlap</h2>
<p class="noindent">It’s helpful to know how the shoulder muscles fit together so you can overlap the forms in your drawing. Here is how the muscles are ordered.</p>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F70.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">The pectoralis connects to the arm under the deltoid and overlaps the biceps.</p>
<p class="Caption1">The latissimus connects to the arm between biceps and triceps on the inside of the arm.</p>
</div>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F71.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">The deltoid connects to the arm between biceps and triceps on the outside of the arm.</p>
</div>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F72.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">The triceps overlaps the latissimus and teres major but is under the infraspinatus and teres minor.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
<h2 class="SBHD">Exercise</h2>
<p class="SBBOD">Search for photos of athletes that show the shoulder (gymnasts on the rings or Olympic divers in action are a couple of good choices) and print them out. With tracing paper, figure out the shapes of the muscles. Pay particular attention to how the muscles overlap each other. Remember, you’re not just drawing lines but three-dimensional shapes.</p>
