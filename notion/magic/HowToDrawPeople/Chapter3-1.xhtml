<h1 class="A-head">Sculpting Forms</h1>
<p class="noindent">Playing around with three-dimensional forms is fun. You don’t have to worry about making them look like something specific. Make a box stretch or twist. Smash a ball or cut it in half. Poke holes in a pyramid. Break apart a cylinder. Make a box look flabby. Make a sphere look sad. Try to give the shapes personality and a feeling that they’re in motion.</p>
<p class="indent">Please don’t skip over this lesson: It’s essential to the rest of the chapter and, really, to all of drawing. If you can master making shapes appear to have dimension on the flat page, you will be well on your way to being an excellent draftsman. These skills are expanded upon in the sections on Merging Forms (<a href="Chapter3-4.xhtml">pages 40</a>–<a href="Chapter3-4.xhtml#page41">41</a>) and Cylindrical Forms (<a href="Chapter3-6.xhtml">page 44</a>).</p>

<p class="Caption">After you’re comfortable getting your shapes to bend and stretch, you can make them interact. You can punch holes in them, have other shapes pass through them, or break them into pieces. Keep playing around with the shapes and discover all the different things you can get them to do.</p>

<h2 class="SBHD">Exercise</h2>
<p class="SBBOD">Stop here and search the Internet for images of abstract sculpture. Many abstract sculptures are forms and volumes that have been bonded and twisted together. They may simplify the human form, represent an abstract thought or strive to evoke a feeling. Find some examples that you like and draw them. Do not draw them in an effort to copy the photo but to re-create the shapes as they sit in space.</p>
