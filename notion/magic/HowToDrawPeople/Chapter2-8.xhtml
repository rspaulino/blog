<p class="Assignment-HD">1| Find Reference Photo</p>
<p class="SbS1">Find a photo of someone who is posed in an extreme wayâ€”someone posed with a strong twist or bend in the torso and arms and legs in motion. Parts of the body will likely be foreshortened.</p>
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C2-F28.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Assignment-HD">2| Draw Armature or Gesture Drawing</p>
<p class="SbS1">Lightly draw the pose as either an armature or as a gesture drawing. Do not trace the image; figure it out for yourself through careful observation.</p>
<p class="Assignment-HD">3| Create Skeleton on Top of Sketch</p>
<p class="SbS1">Re-create the whole pose as a simplified skeleton by drawing on top of your armature or gesture drawing.</p>
