<h1 class="Demo-Head"><span class="demo">Demonstration</span><br/>Merging Forms</h1>
<p class="noindent">Expand on the skills you learned in the Sculpting Forms section (<a href="Chapter3-1.xhtml">page 37</a>) by merging forms. Merging forms allows you to create more complex structures by connecting two or more spheres, boxes or cylinders.</p>

<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">1</span> Draw Stacked Forms</p>
<p class="SbS1">You can merge forms by connecting them as if they were in a sack or by squashing the two parts together.</p>
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C3-F11.jpg"/></p>
<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">2</span> Move Merged Forms</p>
<p class="SbS1">Once you have two forms merged, start playing around with moving them. Figure out how to twist, bend, squash and stretch your new form.</p>

<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">3</span> Move and Merge More Forms</p>
<p class="SbS1">Choose other simple forms to merge and move.</p>

<p class="SbSHD" id="page41"><span class="number">4</span> Create More Complex Forms</p>
<p class="SbS1">You can combine different forms in countless ways. For example, the forms can connect edge to edge, one can poke out or pass through the other or one could just blend or melt into another. The point is to start creating more complex forms built from the simple forms you already know how to draw.</p>

<h2 class="SBHD">Exercise</h2>
<p class="SBBOD">Animated characters are built by combining basic forms like these. Find images of your favorite characters and deconstruct them to discover their simple shapes. To see some examples, search the Internet for “character sheets” of classic Disney characters (such as the dwarfs from <i>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</i>, Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck), any of the Warner Brothers characters or your favorite cartoon.</p>
