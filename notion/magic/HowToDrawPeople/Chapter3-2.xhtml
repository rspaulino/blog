<h1 class="Demo-Head"><span class="demo">Demonstration</span><br/>Head Shapes</h1>
<p class="noindent">You can see how the heads on this page are more defined versions of those in the Head and Neck demonstration (<a href="Chapter2-1.xhtml">page 23</a>). They still have the cranium in back and the face attached at the front, but they are more cohesive forms. Instead of just a line indicating the eye line, a wedge shape has been cut out for the brow and eye region. The mouth is built on top of a saucer shape attached to the face. The jawline has a distinct edge and clearly shows thickness. Drawing the head this way uses the exact same skills you practiced on the previous page. Youâ€™re putting together modified boxes and spheres in a way that represents a human head.</p>

<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">1</span> Draw a Spherical Head</p>
<p class="SbS1">Start with the simplified interlocking spheres from the Head and Neck demonstration (<a href="Chapter2-1.xhtml">page 23</a>).</p>
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C3-F5.jpg"/></p>
<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">2</span> Draw a Box Head</p>
<p class="SbS1">Draw the same head with boxes.</p>
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C3-F6.jpg"/></p>
<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">3</span> Merge Sphere and Box Shapes</p>
<p class="SbS1">Merge the spherical head and the box head into a head that has both round areas and hard edges. Use a saucer shape for the mouth area. This approximates the muscles of the mouth and the way the mouth area is pushed out by the teeth.</p>
