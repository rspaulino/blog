<h1 class="chap-title"><span class="CN">Level 4</span><br/>Major Anatomy</h1>
<p class="intro">At this point you should be able to construct a three-dimensional figure out of boxes, spheres and cylinders. There’s more than one way to piece those elements together to create a figure. Some figures will call for more block shapes, which creates a sturdier feel, while others might be built from softer spherical shapes. It’s up to you to analyze what you’re drawing and create a figure using the forms that feel best for your subject.</p>
<p class="intro1">The approach to adding anatomy to your figures is no different. For example, when you draw the triceps, you’re not drawing the striations of the muscle like you’d see represented in an anatomy book. Instead you’re drawing the three-dimensional shape of the muscle as it sits on the arm. As you did in Level 3, you’ll use a combination of spheres and cylinders blended together to shape the muscle and better define your overall subject in three dimensions. You’re not looking at the body as a doctor would, but you’re seeing the individual shapes of the muscles and how they fit together.</p>
<p class="intro1">Of course, the more anatomical knowledge you have, the more clearly you can see and understand your subject. This chapter will give you a foundation for understanding the major anatomical forms of a human. It will give you an approach to drawing anatomy to better define your figures three-dimensionally. However, the body is made up of more than 650 muscles, many of which will never show or will barely make an appearance even on the leanest of people. Your goal for this chapter is to learn how to construct the largest and most visually impactful muscles of the body.</p>
<p class="intro1">Once you have mastered the major muscles, you can add more. At that point, referring to an anatomy book would be useful to expand your knowledge. See Further Reading (<a href="Further_reading.xhtml">page 127</a>) for a few recommendations.</p>
