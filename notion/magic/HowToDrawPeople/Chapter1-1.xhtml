<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">1</span> Draw the Head</p>
<p class="SbS1">The first step in drawing an armature is to draw an oval for the head. I start with the head because it establishes the proportion for the rest of the body. Pay particular attention to the angle at which the head tips to the left or right.</p>
<p class="SbS2">When you draw your oval, you don’t need to go around and around. Just draw an ellipse in single lines once around or so. It helps to practice drawing circles of various sizes and elongations until you can draw a simple oval shape consistently.</p>

<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">2</span> Draw the Face Map</p>
<p class="SbS1">Now, you must define how the head is tipping forward or backward. You have to think of your shape as a sphere and not a flat circle. A sphere has three dimensions, where as a circle has only two. I know the page is flat and your circle only has two dimensions, but you can make it appear to have depth simply by wrapping a line around the sphere’s equator.</p>
<p class="SbS2">To see how this works in real life, wrap a rubber band around a ball or draw a line around the middle of a balloon. As you tip the ball or balloon away from you, the curve of the line appears to arch upward; if you tip it forward, the arch will appear to dip downward.</p>
<p class="SbS2">This line around the middle of the oval represents the eye line. The chin will fall at the bottom of the oval. The bottom of the nose is halfway in between the eye and the chin. The mouth is halfway between the nose line and the chin. You can add those lines if you want to show the direction and tilt of the head.</p>
<p class="image-center" id="page11"><img alt="" src="images/C1-F6.jpg"/></p>
<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">3</span> Add the Neck</p>
<p class="SbS1">You will want to add a line for the neck. This line generally represents the spine. Don’t worry about anatomy yet; just have the line start at the back of the sphere opposite the face.</p>
<p class="SbS2">The neck bends and twists to a large degree, so be sure to give it some curvature. Even when a person is looking straight forward, you can see the natural curvature of the neck in profile.</p>
<div class="box">
<h2 class="SBHD">Exercise</h2>
<p class="SBBOD">Stop here and practice ovals and spheres. Once you can draw them consistently, draw the centerline around the sphere. Then add the indicators for the chin, nose and mouth. Finally, add a neck line.</p>
</div>
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C1-F7.jpg"/></p>
<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">4</span> Draw the Torso</p>
<p class="SbS1">The next step is to work down the body to the feet. Draw a line that represents the torso. Like the neck, this line follows the general motion of the spine, but you’re not trying to draw the curves of the spine itself. Don’t worry about the outer curve of the spine at the rib cage or the inner curve at the waist. You’re trying to capture the general movement of the torso down to the hips.</p>
<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">5</span> Add the Hips</p>
<p class="SbS1">On the armature, the hips are represented by a straight line that is at a 90-degree angle from the base of the spine. This makes it easy to figure out how to draw the hip line. Once you’ve drawn the torso line, the hip line will be perpendicular to it.</p>
<p class="SbS2">Facing forward, the hips are wider than the head, but as the body turns to the side, this line foreshortens and could be as small as a single point.</p>
<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">6</span> Draw the Legs</p>
<p class="SbS1">The legs should be about as long as the head, neck and torso combined (assuming the body isn’t foreshortened), bending at the middle for the knee.</p>
<p class="SbS2">Add a simple line to indicate the direction of the feet and to anchor your figure on the ground.</p>
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C1-F8.jpg"/></p>
<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">7</span> Draw the Shoulders and Arms</p>
<p class="SbS1">Each shoulder moves independently, so they aren’t represented by a straight line like the hips are. When the shoulders are shrugged or rotated forward, the shoulder line should reflect this with a curved line. The shoulder line connects to the torso at a right angle, similar to the hips, but it curves up, down, forward or back as it moves away from the body, according to the pose.</p>
<p class="SbS2">Add the arms and hand in a similar fashion to the legs and feet, only a little shorter.</p>
