<h1 class="Demo-Head"><span class="demo">Demonstration</span><br/>Holistic Drawing</h1>
<p class="noindent">Once you’ve fully understood how to build a figure in steps, you’ll find that you will start using the skills you’ve developed as you need them. The divisions between each step will blur. This only happens once you’ve internalized the basics of drawing. Instead of thinking about what the next step is, you’ll be thinking about what you’re trying to communicate with your drawing.</p>
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C5-F8.jpg"/></p>
<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">1</span> Make a Gesture Drawing</p>
<p class="SbS1">Once you’re comfortable with the fundamentals of figure drawing, you’ll start to naturally approach drawing more holistically rather than in parts. You won’t follow a rigid procedure but will use the tools you need at the moment you need them.</p>
<p class="SbS2">When you start your drawing with a gesture, you can also start to capture some volume along with it. In the drawing on this page you can see the gesture lines that flow down the figure and also lines that wrap around the form (the thighs, arms and chest).</p>
<p class="SbS2">With better knowledge of the process, you will have the confidence to leave things out of your drawing as well. Knowledge allows you to simplify because you don’t have to spell everything out. Being able to express something simply, clearly and confidently often makes for a compelling and beautiful sketch, but it requires a higher level of skill.</p>
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C5-F9.jpg"/></p>
<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">2</span> Build Up the Forms</p>
<p class="SbS1">As you build up your three-dimensional forms, you can still use gesture drawing techniques. You can capture volumes and anatomical parts as you keep adding more gesture-like lines.</p>
<p class="SbS2">The advantage of building your figure this way is that it keeps the flow of your gesture drawing, which makes your drawing feel more like it has movement.</p>
<p class="SbS2">The drawing should still be quite light, but if you find an edge of a form or the hard line of a bone that you want to define as a landmark, you can give it more emphasis.</p>
<p class="SbS2">At this stage, the drawing is beyond a gesture, but it clearly isn’t the volumetric figure built in the Step-by-Step Drawing demonstration (<a href="Chapter5-1.xhtml">pages 111–114</a>). It’s somewhere in between. There’s still room for flexibility as the drawing develops and the figure becomes more of a whole rather than a collection of parts.</p>
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C5-F10.jpg"/></p>
<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">3</span> Add Anatomy</p>
<p class="SbS1">As the drawing develops, start to more clearly define all the parts of the figure. Drawing lightly in the previous stages allows you to explore with your pencil but doesn’t interfere as you darken your lines for anatomical forms.</p>
<p class="SbS2">Again, you’re not developing in steps as before. Use all of your tools in tandem—gesture, basic forms, anatomy, values—to build the drawing.</p>
<p class="SbS2">You might spend more time clarifying the anatomy in one area because you want to draw attention to that part. On the other hand, you’ll use simpler gesture lines to deemphasize those parts you don’t want to draw attention to.</p>
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C5-F11.jpg"/></p>
<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">4</span> Finalize Your Drawing</p>
<p class="SbS1">Your final drawing will develop organically. Put down a line and the next will be in relation to the previous. With this method, you are constantly drawing and actively responding to the effect you created. You may have a direction in which you want to head, but the final image will be a result of many small decisions you make along the way.</p>
<p class="SbS2">This is the fun part of drawing. Forget about fixed processes. You don’t need to think about lines and forms once those skills are ingrained. Instead, take your toolbox of skills along for a journey. Where you end up is a combination of your abilities, your personal taste and the decisions you make as you work.</p>
