<h1 class="A-head">Movement of the Waist</h1>
<p class="noindent">The spine is the only thing that connects the skeleton of the upper and lower body. The rest of the structure that holds the body upright is made of muscle. The muscles in the front, back and sides all work together to brace the body when standing tall or to twist and bend the waist when the body is in motion. You have to think of the muscles of the waist both as individual muscles and as a single unit. When one side contracts, the opposite side stretches. When the waist twists, all the muscles spiral.</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re building your drawing, first determine what the motion of the waist is (i.e., through the armature or gesture), and then construct the individual muscles to reflect the twist or bend you indicated.</p>
<h2 class="BHD">Abdominals</h2>
<p class="noindent">The abdominal muscles connect the rib cage to the pelvis at the front of the torso and bend the waist forward when they contract. The muscle is made up of eight muscular parts separated by connective tissue. These divisions are what give lean, muscular people the “six-pack” abs.</p>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F26.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">The fibrous connections between each of the ab muscles arch upward as they near to the rib cage and are flat or arch downward toward the hips. The belly button sits along the middle line between the left and right abdominals often nearest the bottom-most quadrant, but it can be higher or lower on each individual.</p>
</div>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F27.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">Generally, when the muscle is tightened, the top abs push out a bit at the rib cage. The next section moves back in. The third section is more vertical. The lowest section bulges out a bit before connecting to the bottom of the pelvis at the pubic bone. Obviously this area varies greatly, not only because of different fitness levels and fat content, but also depending on the pose and how a person is breathing.</p>
</div>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F28.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">When the abdominals contract, they bend the torso forward, which causes the skin to pile up into rolls. This gives you an opportunity to give your drawing some depth by showing forms overlapping. Each time you put one shape in front of another you give your drawing a stronger sense of depth. If you only define the outside shapes of the forms, your drawing will look flat.</p>
</div>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F29.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">When the torso twists or the person leans back, the abdominals will stretch and flatten out the stomach area. You practiced twisting and bending the torso in the Chest to Hips demonstration (<a href="Chapter3-5.xhtml">pages 42</a>–<a href="Chapter3-5.xhtml">43</a>). This is the same concept, only now you are drawing just the abs instead of a general connection between the two masses.</p>
<p class="Caption1">To draw any muscle, you need to know where it connects to the bone at each end, the three-dimensional shape of the muscle and what joint it is moving when it contracts. For the abdominals, once you’ve drawn in the chest and pelvis shapes, you can easily connect the arch of the rib cage to the hips with this sheet of muscle.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="BHD">External Obliques</h2>
<p class="noindent">At each side of the waist are muscles that bend the torso left and right and help to twist the torso. The muscles connect from the side of the rib cage to the top of the pelvic bone. This area also stores a lot of fat that can cause the flesh to pile up on the side of the body that is compressed.</p>
<p class="indent">Think of the oblique muscles as a thin, soft box that is connected to the rib cage at one end and the pelvis at the other.</p>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F30.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">In these drawings you can see the effect bending and twisting has on the external obliques. In the first drawing the torso stands tall and the obliques follow the contour of the rib cage, filling out the space between the rib cage and the pelvis. In the second drawing the skin over the obliques bunches up on one side and stretches on the other as the torso bends to the side. In the third drawing, the torso twists, causing the obliques to stretch and rotate around the midsection.</p>
</div>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F31.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">This model is very lean, so you can see the breaks in the abdominals more clearly than you would on most people. The slight twist of the body is causing the muscles to stretch. The model’s raised left hip causes the flesh at the side of the body to pile up a bit under the ribs. If the figure had more fat or wasn’t as muscular, these effects of stretching and compression would still affect the shapes in a more muted way.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="BHD">Erector Spinae</h2>
<p class="noindent">The major group of muscles that moves the waist at the back of the body is the erector spinae, two long bundles of muscles that run along the sides of the spine and connect the rib cage to the back of the pelvis at the tailbone. These muscles are the counter to the abdominals. The abdominals contract to bend the torso forward; when the erector muscles contract, they arch the torso back.</p>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F32.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">This muscle group is cylindrical near the hips, and it fans out and flattens as it goes up to the rib cage.</p>
</div>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F33.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">Structurally, the erector muscles are like thick cables along the small of the back and spread out to connect to different ribs as they go higher on the back. Although they are deeper in the body than other large back muscles, their volume can still easily be seen pushing out along the middle of the back.</p>
</div>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F34.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">Mirroring the movement of the spine, the erector muscles shift and twist along with the rest of the torso. When the torso is neutral, the muscles are straight along the center of the back. As the torso twists and bends (as on the left), the muscles twist and bend along with it.</p>

<h2 class="SBHD">Exercise</h2>
<p class="SBBOD">Start by drawing the simplified rib cage and pelvis from the Rib Cage and Spine demonstration (<a href="Chapter2-2.xhtml">pages 24–25</a>). Don’t just draw it standing straight up; try it from different angles and different poses. Use a reference photo if you like or invent poses on your own. If you have colored pencils you can draw in a light color; if not, you can use tracing paper or a light table. Next, in a slightly darker color or on an overlay sheet, draw the simplified shapes of the torso from the Chest to Hips demonstration (<a href="Chapter3-5.xhtml">pages 42–43</a>). Emphasize the twist, stretch or compression of the waist. Finally, in a dark color or on a new sheet, draw in the abdominals, external obliques and the erector spinae. Really pay attention to their three-dimensional qualities and the way they change with the movement of the body.</p>
