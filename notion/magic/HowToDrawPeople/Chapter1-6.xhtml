<h1 class="Demo-Head"><span class="demo">Demonstration</span><br/>Gesture Drawing</h1>
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C1-F15.jpg"/></p>
<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">1</span> Draw the Head and Face Map</p>
<p class="SbS1">As you did with the armature, start your gesture drawing with a circle for the head. Use an eye and face line to indicate the tip and orientation of the head.</p>
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C1-F16.jpg"/></p>
<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">2</span> Add the Neck and Shoulders</p>
<p class="SbS1">Use fluid lines to show the movement of the neck and shoulders.</p>
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C1-F17.jpg"/></p>
<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">3</span> Draw the Torso and Legs</p>
<p class="SbS1">Work your way down the body through the torso, hips, legs and feet. At this point, it should be clear that you’re not drawing the armature but capturing the movement of the body. One line may represent the outside edge of the body. Another line may indicate a twist of the torso or how one body part flows into the next. You are not drawing any anatomical part of the body in particular. Instead, you’re capturing a sense of the whole pose. You will still use the knowledge of proportion and your observation skills of the shifting body, shoulders and hips that you honed when drawing the armature.</p>

<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">4</span> Add the Arms and Hands, and Define</p>
<p class="SbS1">Go back up to the top and add the arms and hands.</p>
<p class="SbS2">If you’d like to define the body a little, you can add lines around the body similar to the one that shows the volume of the head. These lines can help show direction and volume of the body.</p>

<p class="SbSHD">Gesture Examples</p>
<p class="Caption">In the gesture drawings on this page you can see how some drawings emphasize one thing important to the pose, while other drawings hint at it or leave it off completely. For example, some drawings illustrate the hands more clearly because they’re an important part of the figure’s attitude, while they’re de-emphasized in other drawings because they’re not as important to the pose.</p>

<h2 class="SBHD">Exercise</h2>
<p class="SBBOD">Stop here and pull out the photos you chose when practicing the armature. This time practice drawing gestures. Remember to keep the drawings loose and free. Focus on capturing both the pose and the energy of the model. Notice how much faster a gesture drawing can be created than an armature.</p>
