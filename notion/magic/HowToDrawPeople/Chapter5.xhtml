<p class="intro">Anything is easier when you have a step-by-step procedure to follow, and drawing is no different. On the next few pages, I review the steps discussed throughout this book and how you can use each step to build your final drawing. Starting with the Holistic Drawing demonstration (<a href="Chapter5-3.xhtml">page 116</a>), you’ll see how to build a figure more holistically rather than completing one step before moving on to the next. It’s important to be able to build a figure both ways. The more intuitive approach is possible once you master the basics, but the step-by-step approach is extremely useful when dealing with difficult poses or unfamiliar angles that require clearly working out the three-dimensional forms.</p>
