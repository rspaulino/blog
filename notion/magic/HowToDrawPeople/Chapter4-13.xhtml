<h1 class="A-head">Using Anatomy</h1>
<p class="noindent">When drawing something as complex as the human body, starting with a simplified form is a great way to quickly and accurately create the illusion of space. As you develop the drawing, you can add the shapes that better represent the anatomy. You still need to think of these as three-dimensional shapes rather than just lines and contours. You’re not copying the model; you’re re-creating him on the page.</p>
<p class="indent">As you develop your drawing, you will be covering up the anatomy with skin. Knowing the anatomy will help you flow one body part into another. It will help you visualize how the body changes as it moves. You’ll be able to see the model more clearly because you know what to look for, and you will be able to re-create a model in a different position.</p>
