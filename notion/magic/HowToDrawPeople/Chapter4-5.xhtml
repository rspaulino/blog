<h1 class="Demo-Head"><span class="demo">Demonstration</span><br/>Ear</h1>
<p class="noindent">The ear has a complex shape that is sometimes hard to visualize. It’s easier to break it down into three major parts: the outer edge (consisting of the helix at the top and the lobe at the bottom), the inside form (called the antihelix), and the rounded wedge that connects the ear to the head.</p>
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F16.jpg"/></p>
<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">1</span> Draw the Outer Edge</p>
<p class="SbS1">Draw the outside shape of the ear as a simplified three-dimensional C-shape.</p>
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F17.jpg"/></p>
<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">2</span> Draw the Inside Shape</p>
<p class="SbS1">Draw the inside of the ear as a simplified bent Y-shape.</p>
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F18.jpg"/></p>
<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">3</span> Merge the Shapes</p>
<p class="SbS1">Merge the two forms to make a simplified ear. You can then add in the other anatomical parts like the earlobe and the flap in front of the ear.</p>
<p class="SbS2">The shapes and ridges of the ear are all designed to redirect sound into the ear canal. Look at the folds and imagine how sound waves would bounce off the outer ear and be channeled into the inner ear. Envisioning the function of anatomical parts can remind you of its form.</p>

<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">4</span> Draw the Back of the Ear</p>
<p class="SbS1">The back of the ear is pushed out by a cylindrical form cut into a wedge shape.</p>

<p class="Caption">You can see how similar this more anatomically accurate ear is to the basic shapes version above. The rigid angles have become smooth undulations.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="BHD">Expressions</h2>
<p class="noindent">All the features of the face move around for practical reasons (talking, eating, blinking, sniffing) and for emotive reasons. Expressions can stretch, compress or twist the features. This gives the artist an opportunity to play and exaggerate the face as a means of getting the emotion of the expression across. Watch yourself make different expressions in a mirror and notice how each of your features transform and move. This is why you can’t learn to draw eyes or a nose by copying a picture; you must understand how the parts fit together and how they move. This understanding is what allows you to construct a head from simple building blocks and get it to express the emotion you want to portray.</p>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F21.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">This model seems to be looking at something unpleasant. The twisted mouth and flared nose hints at repulsion. The furrowed brows express worry. The sideways glance shows he may not want to face the source of his concern directly. The twisting and compressing of the features express his emotions.</p>
</div>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F22.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">This neutral expression is subtle, but the lines beside his mouth and the bags under his eyes express weariness. His gaze engages the viewer directly rather than making us figure out what he’s reacting to. Small changes to the face would make a dramatic difference to the way we react to his expression. Downcast eyes will make him seem sad. A lifted eyebrow may will him appear skeptical.</p>
</div>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F23.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">The look of surprise stretches all the features vertically. The eyebrows are raised. The eyes are wide open. The wide-open mouth stretches the nose and elongates the whole face.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="BHD">Neck</h2>
<p class="noindent">In previous chapters, you used a simple curved cylinder to represent the neck. Anatomically the neck is held up by the trapezius muscle in the back that stretches from the base of the skull, down the neck and out to the shoulders.</p>
<p class="indent">The sides have long muscles (called the sternocleidomastoid) that connect to the skull behind the ear to both the clavicle and sternum. This is what turns the head from side to side.</p>
<p class="indent">Below the chin, a series of muscles pull back toward the neck (connecting to a bone called the hyoid). On lean people, this will be a fairly flat plane. On heavier or older people, this area can bulge out into a “second chin.”</p>
<p class="indent">The front of the neck also has several muscles, but in general, the shape is determined by the throat, which includes the windpipe (trachea), Adam’s apple (larynx) and glands.</p>
<p class="indent">When drawing this area, start with a central cylinder and attach the muscles to that. Connect the chin to the throat, the back of the skull to the shoulders and the side of the skull to the clavicle. All of these muscle shapes will stretch and compress as the head moves in relation to the torso.</p>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F24.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">In the drawing on the right, you can see the bottom part of the cylinder used to build the simplified neck. The muscles then are built around that round shape. The sternocleidomastoid muscle wraps around from the base of the skull to the clavicle and breastbone. The throat moves down the centerline at the front of the neck. The trapezius muscle attaches to the back of the skull and spreads down from the outer third of the clavicle, out to the shoulder and down the back.</p>
</div>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F25.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">Once all of the parts of the head and neck are covered by skin and fat, they become far less distinctive. The muscles still affect the surface topography of the body, so you have understand the shapes of the muscles that lie below the skin. Knowing where the muscles are and their three-dimensional qualities will help you know what to look for when you’re studying a live person.</p>
