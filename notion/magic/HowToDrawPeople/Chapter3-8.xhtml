<h1 class="Demo-Head"><span class="demo">Demonstration</span><br/>Arms and Hands</h1>
<p class="noindent">The arm has a significant range of motion, which can make it difficult to draw in its many positions. This is why breaking it down into simple forms is so important. If you can get your simplified forms in the right positions and in the right proportions, it will be far easier to figure out the anatomy as you develop your drawing.</p>
<p class="indent">Like the leg, the arm is made up of long cylinders. The upper arm is capped with a wedge-shaped shoulder muscle that connects the arm to the body. This muscle extends halfway down the upper arm. The lower arm is another cylinder that bulges nearer the elbow. At the wrist, you can square off the cylinder to clearly show how the forearm is rotated.</p>

<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">1</span> Draw Upper Arms</p>
<p class="SbS1">Start with a cylinder where the clavicle and scapula meet at the side of the rib cage. The upper arm extends almost to the bottom of the rib cage. You can mark the midway point of the upper arm so youâ€™ll know where the shoulder muscle connects.</p>

<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">2</span> Draw Shoulders</p>
<p class="SbS1">The upper arm is capped by a wedge-shaped shoulder muscle that helps tie the arm to the torso. It connects to the clavicle in the front, the scapula in the back and about halfway down the humerus bone. The shoulder is what gives the upper torso its width. The upper part of the rib cage is fairly narrow but the muscles of the shoulder square off this area.</p>

<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">3</span> Draw Lower Arms</p>
<p class="SbS1">The forearm is a more complicated shape. It starts at the elbow as a cylindrical shape before bulging out and then narrowing again, and finally ending with a box shape at the wrist. The box is useful because it shows how the forearm is rotated. You can refresh your memory about the rotation of the radius and ulna bones in the Forearm demonstration (<a href="Chapter2-6.xhtml">page 32</a>).</p>

<p class="Caption">Anatomically there are three parts to the deltoid, but they all work together to elevate the arm. The middle deltoid (medial) overlaps the front (anterior) and back (posterior) sections. Together they form this curved wedge that caps the upper arm.</p>

<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">4</span> Draw Elbows</p>
<p class="SbS1">Like the knee, the elbow can be represented by a box-shaped hinge. Unlike the knee, however, the elbow appears to have three hinges. The main center hinge, noticeable when the elbow is bent, is the top of the ulna bone in the forearm. The two smaller box shapes on each side represent the bottom of the humerus bone in the upper arm. Think of the two outer edges of the elbow as one box and then draw a thinner box on top of that for the center of the elbow. When the elbow is bent, the edges are offset, but when the elbow is straight, they line up.</p>

<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">5</span> Draw Hands</p>
<p class="SbS1">In the Hand demonstration (<a href="Chapter2-7.xhtml">page 33</a>), you simplified the hand to a boxy mitten. Now you can break the fingers apart using more boxes. At this stage, the box form really makes you focus on how the finger is oriented. It will make adding knuckles and fingernails much easier later on.</p>
<p class="SbS2">As for the proportion of the hand, the first set of knuckles is halfway from the wrist to the tip of the fingers. The second set is halfway from the first knuckle to the end of the finger. And the outermost knuckle is halfway from the second knuckle to the end of the finger.</p>
<div class="box">
<h2 class="SBHD">Exercise</h2>
<p class="SBBOD">Stop here and take some time to observe your own hands. Look how the fingers bend at the joints and how the skin folds. Notice the range of motion of your fingers and thumb, and all the different ways they can be posed. Your hand can be made into a fist like a weapon, or it can delicately hold something fragile. It can be used as a tool or to accentuate expressive speech. Observe both the construction of the hand and how it moves.</p>
