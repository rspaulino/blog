<p class="noindent">Before you move on you should master the basic skills highlighted in this chapter.</p>
<ul>
<li class="Checklist">Have a set procedure when you build a figure. Start from a gesture, build up the three-dimensional forms, add anatomy and add detail. Having a set system helps you know what to do next. You don’t always have to be rigid in your process, but having an order that you generally follow brings confidence and consistency to your work.</li>
<li class="Checklist">Adapt any anatomical shape to fit the body you’re trying to draw, regardless of whether it is a model in front of you or a character you imagine.</li>
<li class="Checklist">Begin to develop your own style and approach to drawing. Exposing yourself to artistic styles that appeal to you—and those that don’t—inform the choices you make in your art. The more you know, the more you can put into your own work.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="SBHD">Where to Go From Here</h2>
<p class="SBBOD">Keep drawing. Whether you practice drawing from a live model, rely on photos or invent figures from your imagination, you can always find ways to build your skills. A sketchbook that you draw in as you go about your day is also a great way to stretch your abilities and a good place to jot down ideas you come across.</p>
<p class="SBBOD2">If you enjoy drawing realistic figures, then focusing on anatomy will allow you to add more and more detail to your drawings. If you prefer a more stylistic approach, then keep exploring and experimenting and see where it takes you. Regardless of your goals, the fundamentals of drawing will always play an important part in your craft.</p>
<p class="SBBOD2">Most important, have fun drawing. Drawing is a great skill to have, and it’s also a pleasurable way to record your experiences and express yourself.</p>
