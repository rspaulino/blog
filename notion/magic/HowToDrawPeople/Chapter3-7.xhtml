<h1 class="Demo-Head"><span class="demo">Demonstration</span><br/>Lower Body</h1>
<p class="noindent">Cylinders are perfect for blocking out the space for legs. Using the simplified skeleton as a foundation, the cylinder for the leg begins at the top of the femur. Feel your own hip bone to see how close the head of the femur is to the skin. The outside edge of the cylinder should start there and taper down to the knee.</p>
<p class="indent">At the top of the thigh, additional muscles are used to pull the legs together. They start near the pubic area and stretch to about halfway down the side of the thigh.</p>
<p class="indent">The lower leg tapers more dramatically and has a bit of a curve at the front because of the shape of the shin bone (tibia). It widens at the back for the calf muscles.</p>

<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">1</span> Draw Legs</p>
<p class="SbS1">Starting with a box for the hips, add a cylinder for the thigh. Add a tapered cylinder from the pubic area to about halfway down the thigh. Then add another cylinder for the lower leg. The lower leg narrows at the ankle, so taper the cylinder near the foot. You can also add some curvature to the cylinder so that it arches a bit toward the back and away from the center of the body. This replicates the real shape of the anatomy.</p>

<h2 class="SBHD">Exercise</h2>
<p class="SBBOD">Stop here and find images of animals and draw them as a series of simple shapes. Giraffes, gazelles, tigers, bears, octopi or whatever animal you can think of make great subjects. Use spheres, boxes and cylinders to create your simplified animal.</p>
</div>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C3-F22.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">In direct profile, the cylinders of the leg may appear to be squares, but you still have to think of them as three-dimensional forms that have depth and mass. Also notice the simple curves and tapers the cylinders take to roughly follow the muscles of the body.</p>
</div>
<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">2</span> Draw Knees</p>
<p class="SbS1">When joining the cylinders of the upper and lower leg, you can merge the volumes with a square hinge for the knee. The way the ends of the humerus (upper leg) and the tibia (lower leg) meet creates a fairly blocky structure. Using the box helps to define the front plane of the knee and further clarifies the orientation of the leg in three-dimensional space.</p>

<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">3</span> Draw Feet</p>
<p class="SbS1">The foot is a complicated structure. These illustrations are designed to clearly show the thickness and structure of the foot. Often feet are drawn too flat or without any definition.</p>
<p class="SbS2">The foot can be broken down into two main parts: the top arch and the toes and pads. The top arch is steeper on the inside of the foot and flattens out as it fans out toward the front of the foot.</p>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C3-F24.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">The bottom portion of the foot is flatter and is longer at the big toe.</p>
</div>
<div class="IMAGE">
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C3-F25.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Caption">The bottom of the foot has a big pad at the heel and at the front of the foot under the base of the toes. The inside of the foot arches between these two pads.</p>
