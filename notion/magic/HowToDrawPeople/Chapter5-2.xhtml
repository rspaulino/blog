<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C5-F7.jpg"/></p>
<p class="Assignment-HD">1| Draw a Figure</p>
<p class="SbS1">Start with a gesture drawing for a pose and build up the three-dimensional shapes for a figure. You can develop your figure however you like. It can be muscular, skinny, short or overweight.</p>
<p class="Assignment-HD">2| Change the Proportions</p>
<p class="SbS1">Create a new gesture for drawing the same pose, but this time, build your figure with a different body type. You’ll use different shapes and proportions to develop this new figure than you did for the first one. This exercise will help you practice building shapes and forms that fit your model rather than just repeating the same shapes on every figure you draw.</p>
<p class="Assignment-HD">Extra Credit</p>
<p class="SbS1">Create a new drawing with unrealistic proportions. See how far you can distort the body. For example, you can create a character with tiny hips, a huge chest, very short legs, long arms and a tiny head. This will help you really stretch your skills in morphing anatomical shapes to fit what you imagine instead of what you’ve ever seen before.</p>
