<h1 class="A-head">Sculpting Head Forms</h1>
<p class="noindent">There are many ways to approach drawing the head. What shapes you chose are up to you. Even though individual faces and heads vary greatly, the underlying structures are basically the same. This means you can start your drawing very broadly and get more and more specific to your subject as you develop it.</p>
<p class="indent">In the Level 1 Armature demonstration steps 1 and 2 (<a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#page9">pages 9</a>–<a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#page10">10</a>), you used a simple sphere to depict the head. In the Level 2 Head and Neck demonstration (<a href="Chapter2-1.xhtml">page 23</a>), you used a sphere for the cranium and attached a face plane to it. In the Level 3 Head Shapes demonstration (<a href="Chapter3-2.xhtml">page 38</a>), you more clearly defined some of the planes of the head. In Level 4, you’ll look at how the features fit into this simplified head.</p>
<p class="indent">The simplified planar head is based on the structure of the skull. The skin on the upper part of the face is generally fairly thin, which means the underlying shape of the skull is more prominent. The cheeks and mouth have a lot more muscle and fat, which cover up the lower half of the skull; however, the skull still acts as a foundation that influences the many shapes of the head.</p>
<p class="indent">Understanding the relationship between the planes of the face and the underlying skull is important to drawing a realistic head.</p>

<p class="Caption">Here you can see the relationship between the simplified planar head, the skull and the featureless head. The simplified head forces you to clearly define the three-dimensional structure of the head. It’s based on the underlying structure of the skull and the soft tissue that covers it. Starting with this simpler form makes it easier to add facial features in the correct positions, proportions and perspectives.</p>

<h2 class="SBHD">Exercise</h2>
<p class="SBBOD">It would be ideal to have a medical model of a skull to work with (you can buy one, but realistic models are expensive). If not, you can work from photos of real skulls taken from different angles. Draw the skull as a series of planes. Pay attention to all the different structures and their angles in relation to each other. You can use lots of planes or fewer, depending on how much you want to simplify the form. You can see other artists’ approaches by searching “planar head” on the Internet. This is a similar concept to the Merging Forms exercise (<a href="Chapter3-4.xhtml">pages 40</a>–<a href="Chapter3-4.xhtml">41</a>) but now you are analyzing a more complicated subject and translating it into something new based on your observations.</p>
