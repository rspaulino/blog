<h1 class="Demo-Head"><span class="demo">Demonstration</span><br/>Nose</h1>
<p class="noindent">The nose is such a large feature on the face, but people often just draw the contour of its shape and then put two black dots below for the nostrils. You have to think about the structure of the nose and the way it sticks out from the face if you want to draw it convincingly.</p>
<p class="indent">As with everything else, you can break down the nose into simple shapes. If you start with a box to define the length of the nose you can quickly capture the space and angle at which the nose sits in relation to the face. Next, you can add some bell-like shapes along each side for the nostril areas. Once you start working with these basic building blocks you can more easily alter them to shape the nose and give it character.</p>

<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">1</span> Draw a Box</p>
<p class="SbS1">The nose sticks out from the face. Draw an angled box shape to act as a foundation for the nose.</p>

<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">2</span> Add Nostril Shapes</p>
<p class="SbS1">Add a small bell shape on each side of the box for the nostril area.</p>
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C4-F9.jpg"/></p>
<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">3</span> Taper the End and Add Nostril Holes</p>
<p class="SbS1">The upper half of the nose has a bony structure below but the lower half is built from cartilage. In these drawings, the horizontal line about halfway down marks the edge of the bone. Below that, the tapering shapes represent the cartilage portion. The end of the nose rounds off and turns back to form the bottom of the nose. The bottom of the bell shape has an opening. Make sure that when you draw the opening for the nostrils you give the bottom ridge some width.</p>

<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">4</span> Draw a Variety of Noses</p>
<p class="SbS1">Play around with different angles and proportions of the different segments of the nose. Like the eyes, the nose also varies enormously from person to person. The overall size in relation to the face, whether itâ€™s turned up or hooked down at the bottom and how prominent the bridge of the nose all dramatically impact the look of the face.</p>
