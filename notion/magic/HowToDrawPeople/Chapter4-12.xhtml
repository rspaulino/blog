<h1 class="A-head">Skin</h1>
<p class="noindent">Knowing the underlying anatomy of the body is so important when drawing the figure because the muscle and bone dictate what the surface of the skin looks like. What the skin rests on top of determines how you handle drawing the body. For example, understanding that the knuckle of the hand is bone and tendon means you draw the skin that covers it with a more solid feel than the softer, fleshy pads on the bottom of the fingers.</p>
<p class="indent">Drawing the skin is very much like the Merging Forms demonstration (<a href="Chapter3-4.xhtml">page 40</a>). For that exercise, you put two of the basic forms (e.g., a box and a sphere) in what looks like a sack. You can see the underlying forms holding up this outer sheath, but youâ€™re only drawing how it appears on the surface. This is the same concept as drawing the skin. All the anatomical forms lie just below the surface and are what give the body its shape. The more understanding you have of the three-dimensional qualities of the underlying anatomy, the more you will be able to sculpt the outer appearance of the body.</p>
<p class="indent">How much of the underlying anatomy shows on the surface is determined by how prominent the underlying anatomy is and how thick the skin is. An athlete who has worked to develop his or her physique and has a low percentage of body fat will show the muscles more clearly than someone who has thicker skin and less developed muscles. However, even for the bodies that have a higher percentage of fat, the bones and muscles determine its overall shape. They are just softened by the skin that mutes the underlying forms.</p>
