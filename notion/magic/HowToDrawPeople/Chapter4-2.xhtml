<h1 class="Demo-Head"><span class="demo">Demonstration</span><br/>Eyes</h1>
<p class="noindent">Often when people draw the eyes they’re only thinking of the shape of the lids and the round iris, but you need to consider the whole three-dimensional shape of the eye. The eye is a round ball that sits in the socket of the skull. It’s surrounded by muscle, fat and skin and is covered by the top and bottom eyelids. Understanding the structure of the eye is important to drawing it in a way that feels real on the page.</p>

<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">1</span> Draw the Eyeball</p>
<p class="SbS1">The eyes are spheres that sit in the eye sockets of the skull.</p>

<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">2</span> Draw the Eyelid</p>
<p class="SbS1">The lids rest on top of the eyeball. They do have some thickness so think of them more like a piece of cardboard than a sheet of paper.</p>

<p class="Caption">When you’re drawing the eye on the face, you have to have a clear understanding of the three-dimensional shape of the head. The eyes need to fit in the planes of the head so they’re positioned correctly and in the right perspective. You don’t want to just copy the shapes you see—you want to re-create what you see as three-dimensional forms on the page.</p>

<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">3</span> Draw a Variety of Eyes</p>
<p class="SbS1">You have a lot of latitude when you’re drawing eyes because the curves and angles of the lids vary widely from individual to individual. If you’re drawing a portrait of someone, getting these angles right is essential to capturing their likeness. Some people have thick eyelids. Some people have lids that droop or fold over. Others may have bags under their eyes. The size and value of people’s irises vary, and the dark pupil in the middle of the eye changes with the light and emotion of the person. As you render these variations you must also consider how the ball of the eye sits inside the bony skull and is covered by skin.</p>
