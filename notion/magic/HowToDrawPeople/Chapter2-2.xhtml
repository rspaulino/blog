<h1 class="Demo-Head"><span class="demo">Demonstration</span><br/>Rib Cage and Spine</h1>
<p class="noindent">What you’re trying to accomplish with the simplified skeleton is a drawing that shows the volume of the underlying structure of the body. It’s too easy to lose sight of the volume when you’re focused on small details. This is especially true for the rib cage. If you start drawing the individual ribs, you’ll likely lose sight of the three-dimensional shape of the rib cage as a whole.</p>
<p class="indent">So forget about each individual rib and draw the rib cage as an egg shape.</p>

<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">1</span> Draw the Rib Cage Shape</p>
<p class="SbS1">The rib cage is narrower at the top than you probably realize because when you look at a person you see the muscles of the chest and back squaring off the shoulders. When you look at a skeleton, you realize how narrow the rib cage gets at the top to make room for the clavicle and scapula. Remember, even though this looks like a circle on the page, you need to think of it as a three-dimensional shape, like an egg.</p>

<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">2</span> Add Anatomy</p>
<p class="SbS1">When you draw the shape of the rib cage’s arch consider how you would draw on top of a three-dimensional shape. It’s similar to drawing the eye line on the armature face map, but it curves around the shape.</p>
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C2-F8.jpg"/></p>
<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">3</span> Add the Neck</p>
<p class="SbS1">Draw a hole in the top front of the form for the opening of the neck.</p>
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C2-F9.jpg"/></p>
<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">4</span> Draw the Spine</p>
<p class="SbS1">Once you have a handle on drawing the rib cage as an egg shape, you can enhance the form to look more like the actual shape of the rib cage. The spine runs through the back of the rib cage. Practice drawing the rib cage and the spine from all different angles.</p>
