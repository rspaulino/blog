<h1 class="Demo-Head"><span class="demo">Demonstration</span><br/>Shoulder Girdle</h1>
<p class="noindent">The shoulder girdle is made up of the clavicles in front and the scapulae in back. Together they encircle the rib cage and work together to attach the humerus (upper arm bone) to the rib cage. They also give the arm range of motion at the shoulder.</p>

<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">1</span> Draw the Rib Cage and Clavicle</p>
<p class="SbS1">Start with a rib cage and add a clavicle. The clavicle starts at the breastbone and stretches out to the shoulder in an S-shape. The bone stays in place at the breastbone in the center of the rib cage but moves up and around where it meets the arm at the shoulder.</p>
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C2-F17.jpg"/></p>
<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">2</span> Draw a Raised Arm</p>
<p class="SbS1">When the arm is raised, the clavicle pivots up with it. You can see how the S-shape of the clavicle wraps around the neck.</p>
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C2-F18.jpg"/></p>
<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">3</span> Draw the Scapula</p>
<p class="SbS1">Add a scapula on the back of the rib cage. The scapula is roughly a triangular shape that reaches around the back of the rib cage out to the shoulder. It attaches to the humerus and is connected to the back by several muscles.</p>
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C2-F19.jpg"/></p>
<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">4</span> Draw an Outstretched Arm</p>
<p class="SbS1">When you raise your arm to the side, the scapula rotates away from the spine.</p>
<p class="image-center"><img alt="" src="images/C2-F20.jpg"/></p>
<p class="SbSHD"><span class="number">5</span> Draw a Lifted Arm</p>
<p class="SbS1">When you extend your arm in front of you, the scapula moves toward the side of the rib cage. Add the upper arm.</p>
<p class="SbS2">The humerus is a relatively straight bone. It has a ball head where it meets the shoulder girdle, and it widens at the elbow.</p>
