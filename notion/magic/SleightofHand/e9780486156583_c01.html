<p class="p-c">THE PALM PROPER—THE FINGER PALM—THE THUMB PALM—THE REVERSE PALM.</p>
<p class="p-blanc"> <br/></p>
<p class="p">Method 1. <span class="i">The Palm Proper.—Hold</span> the coin firmly between the thumb on the one side and the middle and third fingers on the other, the first and little fingers taking up graceful positions, as it were, to cover the movement about to be made (<a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156583_c01.html#int_1" id="ref_int_1">Fig. 1</a>). Remove the thumb to its ordinary position of repose, and, at the same instant, let the two fingers (second and third) press the coin into the palm of the hand, half way down the root of the thumb, the muscles of which must be brought to bear against the edge of the coin, so that it is held firmly and forms a bridge over the hollow of the hand (<a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156583_c01.html#int_2" id="ref_int_2">Fig. 2</a>). A backward and forward swing should be given to the hand whilst the coin is being palmed, as it not only covers the movement, but also facilitates the operation in a marked degree. In pressing the coin home, it will be found that the third finger will be more used than the middle one. The instant the palm is effected, the hand must be made to assume the most natural position possible under the circumstances, the little finger being well thrown out, after the dainty manner ladies affect when holding a cup, so as to give the hand breadth. Some beginners think that in holding the hand perfectly flat they are effecting a very beautiful palm; but this is not the case, as can be seen at once by looking at the hand without any coin in its palm. That is the model the conjuror must copy: any unnatural position at once betrays the fact that something unusual is going on. For this method, the florin will be found the best coin, its edge affording a better hold than that of any other piece.</p>

<p class="p-indent"><span class="i">Method 2. The Finder Palm</span>.—The coin is held between the thumb and forefinger, and the latter then slid aside, so that the coin rests upon the side of the middle finger. The forefinger then takes the place of the thumb, and the coin is held as in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156583_c01.html#int_3" id="ref_int_3">Fig. 3</a>. The action is simplified if the coin is held in the first instance between the thumb and middle finger, but it looks awkward and suspicious. This method will be found particularly adapted for concealing coins of the size of a shilling and less. Larger coins should not be treated thus, except in emergencies, when anything is allowable.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Method 3. <span class="i">The Thumb Palm</span>.—This palm is not generally known, which is to be wondered at, for it is a very safe and easy one. The coin is simply held between the thumb and forefinger, and then slid to the root of the latter, where it is held, as in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156583_c01.html#int_4" id="ref_int_4">Fig. 4</a>. The only objection to this palm is that it keeps the thumb a close prisoner, to the manifest loss of grace, but it is exceedingly useful for large and slippery coins, such as half-crowns, pennies, and crowns.</p>
<p class="p-indent"><span class="i">Method</span> 4.—Two, three, and four coins may be palmed by the first method, but the method shown at <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156583_c01.html#int_5" id="ref_int_5">Fig. 5</a> is the safer. There is a rather unnatural disposition of the thumb about it, but the fingers are left free play.</p>

<p class="p-indent"><span class="i">Method</span> 5. <span class="i">Reverse Palm</span>.—It is sometimes required of the performer to show that his hands do not contain any coin. If a coin is palmed in one of them, he must first exhibit the other open in a very ostentatious manner, and, whilst the audience is momentarily engaged in looking at it, press the coin, by means of the thumb, through the fingers of the hand in which it is held, so that it protrudes at the back, and cannot be seen from the front (<a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156583_c01.html#int_6" id="ref_int_6">Fig. 6</a>). Some performers have brought this palm to a great state of perfection. One very telling effect is to pretend to throw the coin away. For this purpose, it is held between the tips of the first finger and thumb, whilst lying upon the side of the middle finger. As the action of throwing is imitated, the forefinger is slid over the coin, the thumb being removed, and the coin thus made to protrude at the back of the hand.</p>

<p class="p-indent">Other fanciful methods of palming exist, but they will be of no practical use to the conjuror, so I have omitted descriptions of them.</p>
