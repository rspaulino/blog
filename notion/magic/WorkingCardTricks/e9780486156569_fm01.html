<p class="p-indent">Interest in the art of magic has never been greater than it is today, and because of this many people are being drawn to magic as a hobby. It is with these newcomers in mind that the present collection of card magic was assembled, but whether you are a complete novice or an experienced amateur you will find the material in this book easy to master and enjoyable to perform.</p>
<p class="p-indent">While the subject of the self-working card trick is vast, I have tried to choose tricks that require no skill, not even the rudimentary skill of an overhand shuffle, double lift or any other procedure requiring secret controlled manipulation of the cards. The intent is rather to place before the reader those tricks which he can easily grasp, so that he can begin almost at once to perform for friends and discover how much enjoyment can be had from the performance of magic.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Two points must be emphasized. The first deals with the level of technical knowledge that these tricks call for. In many of the tricks you will note that you are instructed to secretly note a particular card before the trick begins, or to secretly reverse a card in the deck prior to performance of the routine in question. Professional cardmen do not have to set up cards secretly because they have the necessary skill to perform the required secret actions right in front of you.</p>
<p class="p-indent">This is another way of saying that when you gain more knowledge in card magic, you can put that knowledge to use in devising shortcuts while working the tricks in this book. If you decide to go the distance and become an absolute master of card magic, you can do so by acquiring another Dover publication, <span class="i">Expert Card Technique</span> by Jean Hugard and Frederick Braue. But if your goal is the entertainment of friends, clients or colleagues, the present collection should be quite satisfactory.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The other point deals with presentation. For most of the tricks, I have sketched in the proper presentation or suggested a presentation idea that can be exploited, but I have not delved into the details of this aspect of the tricks. A Dover book, <span class="i">Magic and Showmanship</span> by Henning Nelms, will set the groundwork for those who want to extract maximum entertainment value from the tricks they perform.</p>
<p class="p-indent">No book is created in a vacuum. In this final paragraph I would like to thank the contributors for their generosity in making the tricks available for publication, Joseph K. Schmidt for his expert artwork, and Martin Gardner for his behind-the-scenes work that saw this book become a reality. Finally, I would like to dedicate this book to my magical mentor, J. W. Sarles.</p>
