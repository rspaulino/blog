<a id="title17"/><h1 class="title-chapter"><span class="b">POKER DEALS</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">The lure of gambling is universal. You will even find that when you have done a few card tricks for friends that at least one person is certain to remark that he would not want to play cards with you.</p>
<p class="p-indent">This chapter treats a number of poker deals, two methods of revealing the Aces, a demonstration of cheating at Bridge, and closes with a trick that packs a double punch; not only does the magician instantly change a Straight to a Royal Flush, he shows in a surprising way how the switch was accomplished.</p>
<p class="p-indent">As a rule the more technical gambling tricks appeal only to people who gamble. For that reason, and because many people are not fully acquainted with the more intricate aspects of gambling and odds, the tricks in this chapter were selected because they do not demand special knowledge of gambling. The routines are easy to follow and seem to demonstrate dazzling skill with the pasteboards.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Not included in this chapter are tricks using dice as well as cards. But you will find such tricks elsewhere in the book—“Fate #1” (No. 40), ”Fate #2” (No. 41), “Blind Dice #1” (No. 43) and ”Blind Dice #2” (No. 44)-and with very little effort you can work them into gambling demonstrations to show how thieves and hustlers exert mental control over dice as well as cards.</p>
<div class="section1"><a id="title18"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">14. LESSON IN LARCENY</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">This trick of Roy Walton’s and the next routine, “Automatic Poker,” illustrate how radically different methods can be exploited to bring about similar effects. In this case the spectator is given a packet of cards and is told to deal five of them to himself. He can take any five, and when he does he will be surprised to discover that he’s dealt himself a Straight!</p>
<p class="p-indent">Preparation is simple. Before starting the trick, arrange to have the 9H - 8S - 7D - 6C &amp; 5D on top of the deck in that order from the top down. Thus, the top card of the deck will be the 9H. Place the deck in its case until ready to perform.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Offer to teach the spectator to become a card sharper in just a few minutes. Remove the deck from its case and openly run through the cards, taking out the 5H – 6S – 7H - 8C - 9D. Arrange them in numerical order with the five as the top card of the packet and the 9D as the bottom card.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Fan the five cards and show them to the spectator. Then square them up and drop the packet onto the table. Remark that you will use five more cards, and as you say this, deal the top five cards of the deck onto the packet that lies on the table.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The balance of the deck is placed aside. Hand the spectator the ten-card packet. Tell him to cut it and complete the cut. Have him do this several times so no one could possibly know the order of any cards in the packet. Then tell him that a good card sharper can of course deal off the top or the bottom as the occasion demands. Naturally the spectator cannot be expected to perform a perfect bottom deal, but you will allow him the option of taking either the top or the bottom card.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Tell the spectator to take five cards for himself. Emphasize that he can take some cards from the top and some from the bottom, or he can take all five cards from the top, or all five from the bottom, or he may decide not to bottom deal at all. In this last case, if he decides to deal honestly, he would simply deal out two poker hands in the conventional fashion.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Regardless of which way he decides to deal, he will always get a Straight. While he looks at his cards, drop your hand on top of the deck and comment, “I wouldn’t want to play cards with you.”</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title19"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">15. AUTOMATIC POKER</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">In recent times the demonstration of dealing the winning hand at poker has developed in an unexpected direction; nowadays the magician can allow the spectator the opportunity to pick cards completely at random, and still guarantee that he will get a pat hand. Not only that, the magician can even predict ahead of time exactly which kind of poker hand the spectator will get. Finally the spectator deals the magician an even better hand!</p>
<p class="p-indent">As the audience sees it, the magician writes a prediction and drops it into a glass so it is on view at all times. He then allows the spectator a completely random choice of cards from a packet of different cards. The spectator can take any five cards he desires—there is absolutely no restriction on his choice of cards. He might end up with a King-high Straight. The prediction is opened and it is found that the magician predicted the spectator would choose exactly that, a King-high Straight. Then the magician shows his own hand and it is an Ace-high Straight!</p>
<p class="p-indent">A simple set-up does all the work. Beforehand, stack the top 11 cards as follows from the top down: KD – 10S – 10H – JC – JD – QS – QC – 9H – 9C – AH – KH. Place this packet face-down on top of the face-down deck. The top card of the assembled deck is the KD.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Tell the spectator you’d like to show him something you learned from a gambler. Push over the top cards of the deck, silently counting them until you have pushed over 11 cards. Take these 11 cards into the right hand. The left hand then places the rest of the deck on the table, and the packet of 11 cards is returned to the left hand. Do not call attention to the number of cards in the packet.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Explain that you will use five pairs of cards, all different. With the left thumb push the top two cards over to the right. These two cards are taken by the right hand and shown to the spectator. The pair will consist of a King and a Ten. Do not reverse the order of the cards when you take them into the right hand. Simply take them, show them to the spectator and replace them on the bottom of the packet. If done correctly, the bottom card of the packet will now be the 10S.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Repeat with each of the next four pairs of cards. As you do, point out that each pair contains different cards. Tell the spectator that he is going to have the opportunity to pick his own hand. But to illustrate the power of subliminal suggestion, you claim that you can determine ahead of time exactly which kind of hand he will get-in other words, two pair, a Flush, one pair, or any other combination.</p>
<p class="p-indent">On a slip of paper write, “You will deal yourself a King-high Straight.” Fold the paper in half and in half again and drop it in a glass so it is on display and obviously isolated from any tampering that magicians are always accused of using.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Now take the top pair of cards in the right hand. Ask the spectator to choose one card of the pair. Both cards are of course face-down and you do not allow the spectator to see the faces of the cards. He picks a card and places it face-down before him. You then take the remaining card of the pair and place it under the packet.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Repeat this procedure with the next four pairs of cards. Each time the spectator gets a free choice of which card in the pair he wants, and each time you place the remaining card under the packet.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When the spectator has five cards, drop the remainder of the packet on top of the deck. Let the spectator turn his hand over and arrange it to show that he has a King-high Straight. Let him open the prediction and verify that you predicted exactly which hand he would get.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Then say, “You made only one mistake. The five cards you left me with make an even better hand.” Deal the top five cards off the deck and turn them over to show that you beat him with an Ace-high Straight.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title20"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">16. NAMING THE ACES</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">The spectator shuffles the deck. Then the magician says he can guess the suit of the first Ace that the spectator will deal. The magician names the Ace of Hearts. The spectator deals cards off the top of the deck until he comes to the first Ace. It is the Ace of Hearts.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The Ace of Hearts is placed aside. The spectator assembles the deck and gives it another shuffle. Challenging the odds, the magician offers to repeat the trick and correctly guess the suit of the first Ace that will turn up on this round, saying it will be the Ace of Spades. The spectator deals the cards one at a time off the top. When he turns up the first Ace, it is indeed the Ace of Spades.</p>
<p class="p-indent">“There are two Aces left in the deck,” the magician says. “I’ll bet you turn up the Ace of Clubs before you get to the Ace of Diamonds.” The spectator deals cards one at a time off the top of the deck, and sure enough the Ace of Clubs turns up before the Ace of Diamonds.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Note that the entire trick takes place with the cards in the spectator’s hands, and further that he shuffles the deck repeatedly, making it a challenging feat and one that will be of special interest to any spectator interested in seeing the laws of chance overcome.</p>
<p class="p-indent"><span class="i">Method:</span> Arrange the four Aces on top of the deck in Hearts, Spades, Clubs, Diamonds order. Then remove any three cards from the center of the deck and place these on top of the Aces. This is the only preparation.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Hand the deck to someone who plays cards and can be counted on to give the deck a good, even riffle shuffle. Generally he will be a card player or someone interested in gambling, so he will find this demonstration of particular interest.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Tell him that you’ve made a study of the laws of probability and think you can outwit the odds. Have the spectator give the deck a riffle shuffle. Then say that you will ask him to turn cards face-up one at a time off the top of the deck and that the first Ace he turns up (here you pretend to make a mental calculation) will be the Ace of Hearts.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The spectator deals cards onto the table until he gets to the first Ace. It will be the Ace of Hearts. Have him place this card aside. Then tell him to pick up the dealt cards and replace them face-down on top of the deck. Thus far the demonstration has proven nothing; you could have an infallible system as you claim, or you could be merely lucky.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Instruct the spectator to cut off the top half of the deck and riffle shuffle it into the bottom half. This is quite impressive because after the second shuffle the audience thinks the deck is really well mixed.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Remark that according to your system, the first Ace he will turn up this time should be the Ace of Spades. The spectator deals cards one at a time off the top of the deck. The first Ace he comes to will indeed be the Ace of Spades.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Right at this point say, “There are two Aces left in the deck. It’s even money, but I’m so sure of my system, I’ll bet a million to one that of the remaining two Aces in the deck, you’ll turn up the Ace of Clubs first.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Let the spectator continue dealing until he comes to an Ace. It will be the Ace of Clubs.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title21"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">17. THE THREE-JACKS DEAL</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">This routine resulted from collaboration between Lin Searles, the brilliant West Coast magician, and the author. Although based on an old theme, the handling has been streamlined and a logical finish added to the basic routine.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The effect is that you deal two hands of cards, one hand to yourself and one to the spectator. Each hand consists of three cards. On the first round the spectator gets a 10-high Straight. The hands are dropped on top of the deck and you immediately deal two hands again. This time the spectator gets a Straight but it has improved and is now a Jack-high Straight.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The deal is repeated several times and each time, although there is no shuffling, cutting or “stacking” of the deck, the spectator’s hand keeps getting better and better. On the final deal he gets an Ace-high Straight, the highest possible Straight. You remark that you hate to lose, and turn over your hand to reveal three Jacks.</p>
<p class="p-indent"><span class="i">Method:</span> A simple set-up and a bit of handling does all the work. The nine-card stack, from the top of the deck down, is as follows: 9 – K – 8 – J – 10 – Q – J – A – J. The set-up is relatively easy to obtain since suits are not important in this routine. The handling is as follows:</p>
<p class="p-indent">1. Patter about the fact that what is called beginner’s luck is no myth but a scientific fact. Ask someone who has never played cards to sit opposite you at the table. Explain that you will demonstrate how beginner’s luck operates in a real card game.</p>
<p class="p-indent">2. Deal two hands of three cards each, dealing in the conventional manner, alternating a card between the player and yourself. When each player has three cards, place the deck down.</p>
<p class="p-indent">3. Turn up the beginner’s hand and show that it contains a Straight consisting of an Eight, Nine and Ten. Remark that a Straight is an excellent hand in any game of Poker. The fact that the spectator got the Straight the very first deal is merely proof that beginner’s luck is working for him.</p>
<p class="p-indent">4. Place the beginner’s hand face-down on top of yours and place the combined packet on top of the deck.</p>
<p class="p-indent">5. Now repeat Steps 2 and 3 above. Turn up the beginner’s hand and show that he has a better Straight, consisting of the Nine, Ten and Jack.</p>
<p class="p-indent">6. Repeat Step 4 in gathering the hands and returning them to the top of the deck.</p>
<p class="p-indent">7. Deal out a new round and show that the beginner’s Straight has improved again, consisting now of a Ten, Jack and Queen.</p>
<p class="p-indent">8. Gather the hands as described in Step 4 and deal out two hands again. Now the beginner has a Straight consisting of the Jack, Queen and King. It is here, while all attention is on the spectator’s hand, that the secret maneuver is performed. As you point to the spectator’s poker hand, simply drop the deck on the dealer’s hand. Pay no attention to this secret maneuver. Continue to call attention to the remarkable luck experienced by the beginner.</p>
<p class="p-indent">9. Pick up the beginner’s hand, turn it face-down and drop it on top of the deck. Immediately deal out two hands again. Before you turn up the beginner’s hand, ask him if he has a hunch as to what his hand will consist of this time. Since his hand has been improving right along, he will make the logical guess, saying that this time he expects an Ace-high Straight.</p>
<p class="p-indent">10. Turn his hand face-up and show that he does indeed have an Ace-high Straight, the highest Straight he can be dealt, consisting of the Queen, King and Ace.</p>
<p class="p-indent">11. Then remark that you hate to lose. Turn up your hand and show that you have dealt yourself three of a kind, specifically, three Jacks.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Note that even if someone should suspect the possibility of your switching cards in Step 8, there is a throw-off in Step 10 because two of the three cards dealt to the spectator in the previous hand will show up in the hand again in Step 10. This would seem to rule out the possibility of any kind of switch, thus making the appearance of the three Jacks in your hand that much more surprising.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title22"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">18. CUTTING THE ACES</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">Many of the more spectacular methods of cutting to the Aces require a degree of skill and knowledge that is outside the range of the present book, but the following trick achieves a similar end without the need for great manipulative ability. The trick embodies a double climax in that the spectator succeeds in locating the four Kings, with the magician then locating the four Aces.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Arrange beforehand to have the four Kings on the bottom of the deck with the four Aces in back of them. Ask the spectator to cut the deck into four approximately equal packets. The arrangement will look like <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c03.html#int_13" id="ref_int_13">Figure 13</a>, and we will assume the stack of Kings and Aces lies at the bottom of packet “D.” In other words, “D” is the original bottom quarter of the deck.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_text"><div class="image_text"><img alt="e9780486156569_i0014.jpg" src="images/e9780486156569_i0014.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-c"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156569_c03.html#ref_int_13" id="int_13"><span class="i">Figure 13</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">Instruct the spectator to pick up the packet at “A” and to deal a card off the top to position “A,” then a card to position “B,” then a card to position “C,” and then a card to position “D.” He continues dealing to all four positions in turn until he has used up all the cards in the packet.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Now he picks up the cards at position “B” and repeats the same dealing procedure. When he’s done this, have him pick up the packet at “C” and go through identically the same dealing procedure. He then repeats the procedure with the packet at “D.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">At the finish you will again have four heaps of cards on the table. Turn up the top card of each heap. The spectator will be surprised to discover that these cards are the four Kings.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Say, “You did quite well in locating the Kings. Even more remarkable, you left me with the Aces.” After giving the spectator the four Kings, turn up the top card of each packet. This time reveal the four Aces for a strong finish.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title23"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">19. THE BRIDGE HUSTLER</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">Card experts can exert almost total control over a deck of cards during the process of shuffling and cutting the deck in preparation for a game of bridge. Insiders who hustle bridge tournaments know so many ways of cheating at the game that it is virtually impossible to devise sufficient safeguards against their methods. The following is a simplified method of demonstrating how bridge cheats ply their trade.</p>
<p class="p-indent">It is necessary first to set up the deck. The deck will later be shuffled, so it will appear that all possibility of a set-up is impossible. The set-up is accomplished like this: first remove all of the Clubs from the deck and place them aside. Then stack the remaining cards in the order Hearts-Spades-Diamonds-Hearts-Spades-Diamonds, and so on, the basic Hearts-Spades-Diamonds cycle repeated throughout the deck.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When you have stacked the Hearts, Spades and Diamonds as outlined above, drop the clubs on top of the deck. Place the deck in its case and you are ready to begin.</p>
<p class="p-indent">To set the stage, it is necessary to get the conversation around to the game of bridge, and how, at every tournament, there is talk of cheating. Offer to explain how the bridge hustler works. As you talk, remove the deck from the case.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Fan the cards so you can see the faces. Push off the top thirteen cards (the Clubs) and take them with one hand. Riffle shuffle them into the balance of the deck and square up the pack. Hand the deck to anyone for a fair cut. Say, “First they give the deck a good shuffle and a cut. But unknown to those present, the hustler has one suit marked. Let’s say it’s Clubs.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Run through the deck and toss out the Clubs as you come to them. Place the Club packet on the table in front of you. “Therefore,” you continue, “he knows when a Club is coming up and he can second deal or bottom deal to make sure he gets a pat hand.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Pass the remainder of the deck to a spectator for a final cut. Then tell him to deal the deck into three hands to represent the other three hands in a bridge game.</p>
<p class="p-indent">“But the bridge expert doesn’t need to hustle. By means of the shuffles and cuts I illustrated just now, although they look fair, the bridge expert has complete control over the cards. He doesn’t even have to deal.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">By this time the spectator will have dealt out the three bridge hands. Turn over each to show a truly amazing result; one hand contains all Hearts, the next all Spades, and the last all Diamonds.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title24"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">20. ACES UP</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">At the conclusion of some previous trick using the four Aces, drop the Aces on top of the deck, and then relate a story of how a gambler got challenged when he tried to cheat in a game.</p>
<p class="p-indent">First, you explain, he had to stack the Aces. When you say this, deal the top four cards into a face-down row on the table. Then deal a card onto each Ace and then deal another card onto each Ace. At this point you have four heaps of cards on the table, and each heap contains three cards with an Ace on the bottom of each heap.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Gather the four heaps together by placing the heap at the far left on top of the next heap, then this combined heap onto the next, and finally this combined heap onto the last heap.</p>
<p class="p-indent">“While the gambler was stacking the cards, one of the other players became suspicious and took the cards. Just to see if the gambler stacked the Aces, this fellow decided to deal out four hands.” Deal four hands of cards, dealing from left to right, until you’ve again dealt four heaps of three cards each.</p>
<p class="p-indent">“When the suspicious player looked at the hands, he was satisfied that the gambler didn’t stack the Aces.” Turn each hand up and show that each contains only one Ace. Then turn each hand face-down in place. Gather the hands from left to right, exactly as described above.</p>
<p class="p-indent">“The gambler asked what the suspicious player hoped to find. The player said he thought the Aces were being stacked.” Deal out four hands again. When you’ve done this, pick up the <span class="i">last</span> hand you dealt, the one at the far right, and turn it face-up. Show the three cards and say, “The gambler remarked that he wasn’t stacking the Aces to fall into his hand.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Replace the three cards face-down in their original position on the table. Then gather the hands from left to right just as you did before. “The gambler didn’t have to stack the Aces because he was keeping them on top where he could switch them in when he needed them.” Deal the top four cards face-up onto the table to reveal the four Aces.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title25"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">21. POKER EXPERT OUTDONE</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">The creation of Sam Schwartz, this trick is so constructed that it appears as if you are possessed of the uncanny ability to instantly change a mediocre poker hand into a Royal Flush. But the trick is self-working, and even better, contains an unexpected kicker that elevates it to the miracle class.</p>
<p class="p-indent">We will assume you are using a red-backed deck. Remove the Ace of Hearts, King of Spades, Queen of Spades, Jack of Spades and Ten of Spades. Arrange these five cards in Ace-King-Queen-Jack-Ten order from top to bottom. Then remove the Ace of Spades from a blue-backed deck and place it face-down on top of the face-down packet. This complete packet of six cards is placed in your jacket pocket along with the cased red-backed deck until you are ready to perform.</p>
<p class="p-indent">To properly present the trick, first remove the red-backed deck from the pocket and perform a few tricks. Then remark that you would like to relate a story to the audience involving a friend of yours who played poker. In polite circles he would be called a good card handler, but the truth was that he cheated. For example, you say, one night he dealt himself this hand.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Now reach into your pocket, remove the six-card packet and hold it face-up in the left hand. Be careful not to flash the back of the packet. Say, “Using underhanded methods of cheating, he dealt himself a rather good hand, Ace-high Straight.” Remove the Ten from the face of the packet with the right hand and turn it over. Say, “Naturally he used marked cards, as you can clearly see. That’s how he got this black Ten . . . .”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Keeping the Ten face-up, transfer it to the back of the packet. This brings the Jack of Spades into view. You continue by saying, “. . . and this black Jack . . . .” Take the face-up Jack with the right hand and transfer it to the back of the packet.</p>
<p class="p-indent">“. . . A black Queen . . . .” Transfer the Queen to the back of the packet, keeping it face-up as you did with the other cards. “. . . A black King . . . .” Transfer the black King from the face to the back of the packet.</p>
<p class="p-indent">“. . . And a red Ace.” Stop right here so the audience sees the Ace of Hearts on the face of the packet. Then turn the packet over end for end and place it face-down in the left hand. Say, “He wasn’t satisfied with a mere Ace-high Straight.” Take the Ace of Hearts off the bottom of the packet, turn it face-up and place it face-up on top of the face-down packet. The position of the cards in the left hand is shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c03.html#int_14" id="ref_int_14">Figure 14</a>. The left hand is palm-up, fingers together as indicated.</p>
<p class="p-indent">“So by using palming, switches and other methods too unethical to discuss in front of a nice audience like this, he switched the Straight for an unbeatable poker hand.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">As you say this, the left hand is swiftly turned palm-down and it slaps its cards onto the top of the face-down deck, as in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c03.html#int_15" id="ref_int_15">Figure 15</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Take the left hand away. An Ace of Spades will show face-up. To the average spectator it will look as if you used amazing skill to switch out the Ace of Hearts. Without hesitation deal the Ace of Spades off the top of the deck, then the Ten, Jack, Queen and King of Spades to display the Royal Flush in Spades. The transformation of the Straight to a Royal Flush is so dramatic that it will invariably get a round of applause from the audience.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_text_net"><div class="caption"><p class="p"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156569_c03.html#ref_int_14" id="int_14"><span class="i">Figure 14</span></a></p></div>

<p class="p-indent">Acknowledge the applause, then reveal the kicker. “But my friend went too far. In his haste to switch cards, he made a fatal mistake.” Turn the Ten, Jack, Queen and King of Spades face-down to show that they have red backs. This is as it should be, of course. “When he switched in the Ace, he switched it from the wrong deck.” Slowly turn the Ace of Spades face-down to show that it has a blue back. You are almost assured of a sensational round of applause at this point. For the tag line you can say, “Funny thing, he doesn’t play poker much any more.”</p></div></div>
