<a id="title59"/><h1 class="title-chapter"><span class="b">STRANGE SECRETS</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">When an extra card is added to a deck, this card is known in magical parlance as a Stranger Card. The extra card may or may not have the same back pattern as the deck it is being added to, depending on the application. It is an easy matter to obtain such cards. When buying a deck, simply purchase a second deck of cards which has the same back pattern. You may want to buy two such extra decks, one with the same back pattern and the same color, and one with the same back pattern but with a contrasting-color back. Thus equipped, you will be ready to perform any of the tricks described in this chapter.</p>
<div class="section1"><a id="title60"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">52. IMPOSSIBLE LOCATION</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">The value of a Stranger Card in a card effect is such that it can elevate an otherwise ordinary trick into the miracle category. The following is such an effect; you locate a chosen card under difficult conditions, then proceed to repeat the trick, locating the same card under impossible conditions.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Run through the deck you plan to use and remove any card, say the Nine of Hearts. Place this card in your right jacket pocket. Then remove the duplicate Nine of Hearts from another pack and position this card 10th in from the face of the deck you plan to use. This deck is placed in its case and dropped into the left-hand jacket pocket until you are ready to perform the trick. Note that if the deck you plan to use is blue-backed the duplicate 9H you placed 10th from the face should be red-backed.</p>
<p class="p-indent">To set the stage for the trick, get the conversation around to methods used by card sharpers and the fact that many of them have developed sensitive fingertips to the point where they can locate certain cards in the deck merely by sense of touch alone.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Remove the deck from its case and place it face up on the table. Ask a spectator to give you a number between 10 and 20. He might name 15. You then deal 15 cards off the face of the face-up deck into a heap on the table.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Then tell him that in order to make the number completely arbitrary, you will randomize his number. Pick up the packet you just dealt onto the table and replace it face-up onto the face of the deck. Then say that the number 15 contains two digits, a 1 and a 5. Adding these together, you arrive at the number 6.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Deal 6 cards off the face of the deck. Ask the spectator to remember the last card dealt (it will be the 9H). Then drop the balance of the deck onto the cards that lie on the table.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="p-c"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156569_c07.html#ref_int_23" id="int_23"><span class="i">Figure 23</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">Still keeping the cards face-up, invite the spectator to shuffle the deck several times. When he has done this, take back the deck and turn it face-down. Hold the deck so it is vertical to the floor, with the faces of the cards toward the audience. Say that you will try to find his card without looking at the faces of any card in the deck. As you talk, spread the cards from left to right between the hands. Only you can see the backs of the cards, and when you come upon the Stranger Card it will be readily visible, as in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c07.html#int_23" id="ref_int_23">Figure 23</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Pause for dramatic effect, then remove the Stranger Card from the deck and ask if you were correct. The audience will say yes. Still keeping the face of the Stranger Card toward the audience, place this card onto the face or bottom of the deck. Square up the deck and drop it into your left jacket pocket. Then, as an afterthought, say to the audience, “Let me show you that again, under even more impossible conditions.” Remove the deck from the pocket but leave the Stranger Card behind in the pocket.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Have the spectator shuffle and cut the deck. Then have him divide it into five or six packets. Pretend to study the packets. Finally pick up one packet and drop it into your <span class="i">right</span> jacket pocket. Say that you’ll try to find the Nine of Hearts this time without even looking at any cards. Reach into your right jacket pocket and remove the Nine of Hearts previously placed there. Withdraw it from the pocket and bow to the applause.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title61"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">53. SLIM CHANCE</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">This is a prediction trick with a twist. The magician’s prediction appears to be wrong, but then it is discovered that the prediction was correct and in an unexpected manner.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Preparation consists in having the Stranger Card on the bottom of the deck. For this trick it is best to use a blue-backed deck. The Stranger Card is red-backed, and will be the 9S.</p>
<p class="p-indent">On the prediction slip write, “You will choose a red card.” Fold the slip in half and then in quarters and drop it onto the table.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Now have the spectator cut some cards off the top of the deck as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c07.html#int_24" id="ref_int_24">Figure 24</a>. We will assume that the packet he has cut off goes to position “A” on the table. The balance of the deck (the original bottom portion of the deck) is shown in position “B” in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c07.html#int_24">Figure 24</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Now tell him to turn the top card of packet “B” face-up and place it still face-up on top of packet “A,” saying that this will mark the place where he cut. When he has done this, have him place packet “B” on top of packet “A.”</p>
<div class="illustype_image_text"><div class="image_text"><img alt="e9780486156569_i0026.jpg" src="images/e9780486156569_i0026.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156569_c07.html#ref_int_24" id="int_24"><span class="i">Figure 24</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">Take the assembled deck from him and spread it <span class="i">face-up</span> on the table from left to right. Point to the location of the reversed card and say, “We’ll use the card directly above the reversed card.” Remove the card above the reversed card and show it as the 9S. Have the spectator remember this card. Then return it to the deck. Finally, remove the reversed card and place it face-up on the face of the deck.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Say, “Remember that I wrote a prediction before you chose the Nine of Spades.” Have the prediction opened and read aloud. It says, “You will choose a red card.” When the spectator has finished reading the prediction, frown and ask, “Is that all I wrote?” The prediction is obviously wrong since the spectator chose a black card.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Then snap your fingers and say, “Of course. Now I remember what I had in mind. When I said you would choose a red card, I was referring to the back of the card.” Spread the deck face-down on the table. In the entire spread of the blue deck the audience sees a single red-backed card. It is removed, turned face-up, and proves to be the spectator’s chosen card, the Nine of Spades.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title62"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">54. THE BLUE PHANTOM</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">This routine of Roy Walton’s cleverly exploits the use of a Stranger Card. Note here that the intervention of the Stranger Card is delayed so as to bring about a strong finish in an amusing and unexpected manner.</p>
<p class="p-indent">A red-backed deck is used. Remove any card from the deck—say the Ten of Diamonds—and place it aside, as it is not used in this trick. Then remove the duplicate Ten of Diamonds from a blue-backed deck and place it 15 in from the face of the red-backed deck. You are now ready to perform the trick.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Place the pack face-down on the table. Invite spectator “A” to remove a few cards from the top, adding that he should remove fewer than a dozen cards. When he has done this, turn the pack face-up and replace it on the table. Ask spectator “B” to remove fewer than a dozen cards from the face of the deck.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Each spectator now holds a random number of cards. Ask spectator “A” to count the cards he has and to remember the total. Then tell him to remember a card at the same number from the face as his remembered total. In other words, if he has seven cards, he would remember the 7th card you deal.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Deal cards one at a time off the face of the deck into a tabled heap. Stop the deal when you’ve dealt 14 cards onto the table. Spectator “A” has noted and remembered a card as described above. Pick up the 14-card packet and replace it on the face of the deck.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Ask spectator “B” to count his cards. He too is to note a card in a corresponding position as you deal from the face of the deck. Thus, if he holds five cards, he would remember the 5th card you deal. In fact, you deal 14 cards off the face of the deck, dealing one card at a time onto a heap on the table. When you’ve dealt 14 cards, turn the deck face-down and replace it in your left hand. Then pick up the tabled packet of 14 cards, turn it face-down and place it on top of the deck.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Take spectator “A‘s” cards and place them face-down on top of the deck. Then take spectator “B’s” cards and place them face-down on the table. Drop the deck on top of “B’s” cards and square up the complete deck.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Now spread the pack face-up on the table and run your finger along the cards from top to face until you reach the 15th card from the top. This is spectator “A’s” card. Push it out of the deck and ask spectator “A” to verify that this is indeed the card he noted.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When he admits that this is the card, you say, “Actually, anyone could find the cards without even looking at their faces. The reason is that one card will give a stronger impression than the others. It will always stand out.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Turn the pack face-down and spread the deck across the table. The single blue-backed card in the otherwise red-backed deck will stand out like a beacon. Remove the blue-backed card and turn it face-up to reveal that it is indeed spectator “B’s” card.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title63"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">55. IT’S IN THE BAG</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">A card is chosen and returned to the deck. The deck is then dropped into an empty paper bag. As an afterthought, the magician drops the card case into the bag also. He then twists the mouth of the bag and asks the spectator to shake the bag to give the cards a good mixing.</p>
<p class="p-indent">“You will now see,” the performer announces, “a demonstration of fabulous skill, dedication and good looks.” He reaches into the bag, claiming that he can instantly find the chosen card. Immediately his hand is withdrawn, and in it is the card case. He acts puzzled for a moment, then opens the case and finds the chosen card INSIDE the card case!</p>
<p class="p-indent"><span class="i">Method:</span> Although easy to do, this trick can have a strong impact on the audience because of the completely unexpected manner in which you find the chosen card. If the deck you are using is blue-backed, note the top card, which we will say is the Eight of Diamonds, and find the duplicate Eight of Diamonds in a deck of matching back design and color. Place the duplicate Eight of Diamonds in your right jacket pocket. Place the deck back into its case with the original Eight of Diamonds still on top.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When you are ready to perform a few card tricks, remove the deck from the card case, but leave the Eight of Diamonds behind in the card case. Then tuck the flap of the case in so that the card case is closed. Do this in a nonchalant manner, calling no attention to it. When the card case is closed, perform a few tricks with the deck to impress upon the audience that the deck is unprepared and quite ordinary.</p>
<p class="p-indent">To perform “It’s in the Bag,” proceed as follows. Invite a spectator to shuffle and cut the deck. Then take it back from him and drop it into your right jacket pocket. Position the deck in the pocket so that the duplicate Eight of Diamonds already in the pocket will end up as the face or bottom card of the deck.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Ask a spectator to think of a number from 1 to 20. Then remove cards from the top of your deck and place them face-down onto the table. Count aloud as you do this. When you reach the spectator’s number, have him call stop. Then remove the next card—but in fact you remove the Eight of Diamonds from the bottom of the deck—and show him this card. Tell him to remember it.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Replace the Eight of Diamonds in the pocket. Make sure it goes back on the bottom of the deck. Then remove the deck from the pocket, but leave the Eight of Diamonds behind. Assemble the entire deck and drop it into a borrowed paper bag. (If a bag is not readily available, you can use a large handkerchief or a scarf to hold the pack.) Almost as an afterthought, pick up the card case and drop it into the bag, saying, “We might as well get everything in that will fit.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Twist the mouth of the bag and let a spectator shake it to mix the cards. Remark that you will reach into the bag and instantly remove the chosen card. Open the mouth of the bag, reach in and immediately remove the card case. Act puzzled for a moment, saying, “I was certain you picked a thinner card.” Then snap your fingers as if remembering where the card might be. Open the flap of the card case and remove the Eight of Diamonds. Say to the assisting spectator, “You shook the bag so hard, you shook the chosen card right into the card case.”</p></div></div>
