<a id="title9"/><h1 class="title-chapter"><span class="b">IMPROMPTU CARD ROUTINES</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">Audiences are invariably impressed by the fact that the magician can work with any deck handed to him, without the need for special apparatus or elaborate setting-up procedures. Many of the tricks in this book fit the impromptu category, and some, like “Ultra Coincidence” (No. 27) and “Mental Miracle” (No. 67), can be built up as unfathomable mysteries.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The tricks in this chapter were collected together because they are strictly impromptu and thoroughly tested before audiences for maximum impact. Although they are easy to perform, you will get much more credit for magical powers if you pretend that great skill is involved. At least half of the secret of acquiring a reputation in magic is knowing how to act while presenting the trick.</p>
<div class="section1"><a id="title10"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">7. ANY DECK, ANY TIME</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">Although a trick of honorable ancestry, this card location still rates as one of the most impressive in the entire literature on the subject. In describing it here, I will give a step-by-step procedure that should make it easy for anyone to follow, and at the same time avoid ambiguities that might otherwise mislead the reader.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Any deck is used. Tell a spectator to cut it into three piles. The exact number in each pile is not important, but the piles should be approximately equal in size.</p>
<p class="p-indent">While you turn your back, ask him to pick a pile, shuffle it and note the top card. Then tell him to turn the pile face-up and place it on top of either of the two other piles on the table. When he has done this, have him place the remaining pile face-down on top of all.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The condition of the deck now is that there is a face-up pile of cards sandwiched between two face-down piles. Tell the spectator to carefully square up the deck. Then have him cut off half of the deck and shuffle it into the other half.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Tell him to square the deck after the shuffle and give the deck a cut. At this point the spectator himself can look through the cards and verify that face-up and face-down cards are randomly mixed throughout the deck.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Take the deck from him and turn it over. Run the cards from hand to hand. You will notice that small groups of face-up and face-down cards appear at random in the deck. But you will also note something that the spectator will never spot; there is a long run of face-up cards in the deck, longer than any other run.</p>
<p class="p-indent">As you study the cards, pretending to look for his card, cut the deck so all of this long run of face-up cards has been brought to the face of the deck nearest you. Now beginning at the face of the deck, run the cards from left to right until you come to the last face-up card in this long run. The next card (a face-down card) will be the spectator’s card. Reveal it as dramatically as you can.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title11"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">8. MENTAL MATES</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">Two shuffled decks are used. One is red-backed, the other blue-backed. Both may be borrowed and both are shuffled by the spectator. The two red Aces are removed from the red-backed deck, turned face-up, and inserted back into the deck so they are on either side of a face-down card. No one knows the identity of this face-down card between the red Aces.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The magician now removes the two red Aces from the blue deck and places them on either side of a face-down card from that deck. Both decks are handed to the spectator. He removes the card between the red Aces in one deck and finds this card to be the Ten of Spades. Then he removes the random card between the red Aces in the other deck and finds that it too is the Ten of Spades.</p>
<p class="p-indent">What makes this trick so impressive is the fact that it is performed under the most stringent test conditions, using borrowed, shuffled cards.</p>
<p class="p-indent"><span class="i">Method:</span> Borrow two decks and have them well mixed by the spectator. Ask him to remove the red Aces from the red deck. Then have him shuffle the deck once more, just to be certain he has not accidentally seen any cards. Now tell him to spread the deck face-down and place the red Aces face-up on either side of a card, as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c02.html#int_10" id="ref_int_10">Figure 10</a>.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_text"><div class="image_text"><img alt="e9780486156569_i0011.jpg" src="images/e9780486156569_i0011.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-c"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156569_c02.html#ref_int_10" id="int_10"><span class="i">Figure 10</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">Note in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c02.html#int_10">Figure 10</a> that the red Aces are upjogged about one inch. Tell the spectator to leave them in that condition. Then square up the deck, still leaving the Aces upjogged.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Hold the deck face-up in the left hand. Remind the spectator that he placed the two red Aces on either side of a completely unknown card in the pack. Hold the back of the deck to him so he can see the face of the red Aces. Then with the right hand slowly push the Aces into the pack. Referring to <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c02.html#int_11" id="ref_int_11">Figure 11</a>, you will find that as the red Aces are being pushed flush with the deck, the card between them will slide out of the deck just far enough for you to glimpse its identity. In <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c02.html#int_11">Figure 11</a>, this card is the Ten of Spades. This subtle method of glimpsing the spectator’s card is the ingenious invention of Martin Gardner.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Once you have spotted the spectator’s card, square up the deck and turn it face-up. Pick up the blue-backed deck and turn it face-up. Find the two red Aces, but as you do, spot the Ten of Spades in this deck and note how far away it is from one of the Aces. For example, it may be seven cards below the Ace of Hearts.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_text_net"><div class="image_text_net"><img alt="e9780486156569_i0012.jpg" src="images/e9780486156569_i0012.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-c"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156569_c02.html#ref_int_11" id="int_11"><span class="i">Figure 11</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">Upjog the red Aces. Then square up the deck and turn it face-down. Spread it face-down again and say that you will place the red Aces at a random position in this deck. Remove the Ace of Diamonds and turn it face-up. You know that the duplicate Ten of Spades is seven cards down from the Ace of Hearts, so count seven cards and place the face-up Ace of Diamonds on one side of the Ten of Spades. Then remove the upjogged Ace of Hearts, turn it face-up and place it on the other side of the Ten of Spades. Of course, the Ten of Spades is face-down, so the audience assumes you are placing the red Aces on either side of a completely unknown card.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Hand both decks to the spectator. Have him remove the card between the red Aces in each pack. Then have each of these cards turned face-up to reveal they are the Ten of Spades.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title12"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">9. DEUCES WILD</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">The four deuces are removed from any deck. A spectator initials the face of each deuce to guard against the magician’s switching cards. The spectator then shuffles the deuces so the packet is thoroughly mixed.</p>
<p class="p-indent">He chooses a deuce from the packet, returns it to the packet, and further shuffles the packet. The deuces are then handed to the magician. Without fail, the magician names the deuce chosen by the spectator.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The trick is repeated immediately, and once again the magician correctly identifies the deuce chosen by the spectator.</p>
<p class="p-indent"><span class="i">Method:</span> Proceed as written above by having the spectator remove the four deuces from the deck. Ask him to write his initials across the middle of each deuce. Then he is to gather the deuces one on top of the next, turn them face-down and mix them.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Take them from him. Spread them face-down between the hands and have him choose one. While he looks at it, square up the remainder of the packet. The secret comes into play at this point. Simply turn the packet around end for end. All attention is on the spectator at this point, so your action of turning the packet around is not noticed.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Have the chosen deuce returned to the packet. Then hand the packet to the spectator and have him mix the cards. When he’s done this, take back the packet and hold it so that you alone can see the faces of the cards. On three of the deuces the spectator’s initials will be right-side-up. On the fourth deuce the initials will be upside down. This will be the chosen deuce. Of course, the reason why the initials run one way on three of the cards and the opposite way on the chosen card is that you turned the packet around end for end after the chosen card was removed from the packet.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Once you know the identity of the chosen deuce, reveal it as impressively as possible. Do <span class="i">not</span> remove the chosen deuce from the packet or otherwise tamper with the packet. Assuming that the chosen deuce was the Two of Hearts, for example, name this deuce as the chosen one, turn the packet face-down and immediately offer to repeat the trick.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Again spread the cards and have a deuce selected. As it is being shown to the audience, square up the packet and turn it end for end. Have the chosen deuce returned to the packet. Then invite the spectator to mix up the cards.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When he is satisfied that they are well mixed, take back the packet and fan it so you alone can see the faces. Look for the Two of Hearts. The initials will point right side up or upside down. It does not matter which, but make sure you know which way the initials point. Then simply look for the other deuce in the packet that has the initials pointing the same way. There will be only one other such deuce and it will be the deuce chosen the second time.</p>
<p class="p-indent">There is one exception. If the Two of Hearts points the same way as the other three deuces, you know that the second time the spectator again chose the Two of Hearts. When you reveal the card the second time, make the most of this astounding coincidence.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title13"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">10. RAPID TRANSIT</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">Transpositions are those tricks where two or more cards change places. Generally a good deal of skill is required, but the following trick, devised by J. W. Sarles and the author, accomplishes the transposition without skill.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Have a borrowed deck shuffled. While it is being shuffled, secretly note the bottom card. We will say this card is the King of Hearts. Assuming the spectator is sitting across the table from you, ask him to remove his favorite Ace and place it on top of the deck. His favorite Ace may be the Ace of Spades. When he’s placed it on top of the pack, ask him to note and remember the bottom card of the deck also. After he’s done this, tell him to hand you the deck under the table.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Grasp the deck from above by the near ends, more or less as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c01.html#int_4">Figure 4</a>. Tell the spectator to remember the identity of his favorite Ace. As you talk, secretly turn the right hand over so it is palm-up. This also reverses the deck.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Tell the spectator to remove his favorite Ace from the top of the deck. He reaches under the table and removes what he thinks is the top card. But since you turned the deck over, he has removed the bottom card (in our example, the King of Hearts).</p>
<p class="p-indent">Once he’s removed the card, you turn the right hand palm-down again. Tell him to insert the Ace into the center of the deck. When he has pushed the card into the center, secretly turn the deck over again so it is face-up under the table.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Now tell him to remove the bottom card and hold it in his hand. He removes what he thinks is the bottom card. Take the deck and place it face-down on the table. Then reach under the table and take the card from the spectator, remarking, “I want to see what card I’m going to work with to find your favorite Ace.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">When you take the card from him, pretend to look at it. Say, “All right, the King of Hearts.” Here you name the card you secretly glimpsed on the bottom of the deck at the beginning of the trick. Place the card back under the table. The right hand then raps against the tabletop from below. It then comes up into view, holding the card face-down. Turn it over to show it has changed into the spectator’s favorite Ace.</p>
<p class="p-indent">For the finish, have him spread the deck face-down on the table. He should be surprised to discover that the King of Hearts is now reversed in the center of the deck.</p>
<p class="p-indent">You may wonder why, at the beginning of the trick, the spectator was asked to place his favorite Ace on top, since the trick would obviously work just as well with any two cards. The reason is that since he is being asked to remember two cards, you want to make it as easy as possible for him. Thus you ask him to place his favorite Ace or his lucky Ace on top of the deck. Since this card is easily remembered, the spectator will find it no trouble to also remember the bottom card of the deck.</p>
<p class="p-indent">You can also have him initial each card with a pencil at the beginning of the routine. To the average layman, initialed cards eliminate such trickery as duplicate cards. But of course it makes no difference in this trick whether the cards are initialed or not.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title14"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">11. Z-RAY</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">Using any shuffled deck, the magician writes a mystic symbol on the face of a card. A spectator then initials the face of this card. While the magician turns his back, the spectator places the mystic card anywhere in the deck. The magician then turns around. He explains that the mystic symbol confers an eyeless vision known as z-rays to the person who drew the symbol.</p>
<p class="p-indent">To demonstrate that this is so, the magician slowly deals cards off the top of the deck. At some point he stops. When the next card is turned up, it proves to be the card bearing the mystic symbol. Remember that this is done with any borrowed, shuffled deck handed to you, and there is positively no preparation. The cards are borrowed and the trick immediately commences exactly as written. Further, it may be repeated instantly.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_text_net"><div class="image_text_net"><img alt="e9780486156569_i0013.jpg" src="images/e9780486156569_i0013.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156569_c02.html#ref_int_12" id="int_12"><span class="i">Figure 12</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent"><span class="i">Method:</span> Take the borrowed, shuffled deck and hold it face-down in your left hand. Follow the handling carefully because it is designed to direct audience attention away from the secret. Explain that mystic symbols sometimes have a power of their own which they can convey to those skilled in the art of magic. To illustrate, turn the top card of the deck face-up and place it on top of the deck.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The card may be the Two of Hearts. Note in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c02.html#int_12" id="ref_int_12">Figure 12</a> that the Two of Hearts is not placed squarely on top of the deck but is backjogged slightly. Borrow a pencil. Say that you will inscribe the symbol for eyeless vision on the face of the card. Inscribe a mystic-seeming symbol like the one shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c02.html#int_12">Figure 12</a>. But as soon as you finish drawing the symbol, place a tiny dot on the white border of the <span class="i">next</span> card, exactly as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c02.html#int_12">Figure 12</a>. This method of secretly marking a card is credited to Glen Gravatt.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The throw-off comes in at this point. The tiny dot is visible to no one but yourself, so do not be afraid that anyone will spot it. Hand the pencil to the spectator and tell him to place his initials on the face of the Two of Hearts, as this sometimes strengthens the spell. Do not adjust the Two of Hearts or try to hide the secret pencil-dot. This draws attention to the cards and is exactly what you want to avoid.</p>
<p class="p-indent">After the spectator has initialed the Two of Hearts, turn this card face-down on top of the deck. Place the deck face-down on the table. Ask the spectator to deal cards off the top into a heap on the table. He deals a card at a time, beginning with the top card (the Two of Hearts) and continues the deal for as long as he likes. When he stops dealing, tell him to take the dealt packet and place it back on top of the deck. The card bearing the mystic symbol is thus buried somewhere in the deck.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When he’s carefully squared up the deck, take it from him and begin dealing cards off the top one at a time. Sooner or later you will spot the card bearing your pencil dot. Deal this card onto the tabled heap. Then pause dramatically and turn up the next card. It will be the Two of Hearts.</p>
<p class="p-indent">If you wish to repeat this routine, pick up the tabled packet and replace it on top of the deck. Then place the Two of Hearts face-down on top of the deck. The trick can now be repeated exactly as described above.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title15"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">12. MATCHING MATCHES</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">This trick and the next one illustrate how the same effect can be brought about in different ways. This version is based on an ingenious idea of Jack Avis.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Besides the deck of cards, you will need a packet of matches that contains 13 matches, and another that contains eight matches. The number in each packet is not important just as long as the number of matches in both packets <span class="i">total</span> 21.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Tear out the matches from both packets and combine them in a heap on the table. Have someone shuffle and cut a deck of cards. Then, while your back is turned, have this spectator remove any number of matches from the group, count them and place them out of sight in his pocket. Invite a second spectator to count the remaining matches, and then conceal them in his pocket. Thus the first spectator may have 14 matches and the second spectator seven matches.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Explain to spectator “A” that you are going to deal cards, one at a time, off the top of the deck. He is to remember the card that falls in a position corresponding to the number of matches he holds. In our example he would remember the 14th card you deal.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Deal cards one at a time off the top of the deck into a face-up heap on the table. Continue the deal until you have dealt at least 18 cards. Ask spectator “A” if he remembers his card. Then square up the face-up heap, turn it over and replace it on top of the deck.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Now ask spectator “B” to remember a card corresponding to the number of matches he holds. In the above example he would remember the 7th card you deal. As before, deal off the top of the deck a card at a time, dealing the cards one on top of each other in a face-up heap. After you’ve dealt 18 cards pick up the face-up heap, turn it face-down and replace it on top of the deck.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Explain to the audience that although you don’t know either card, you will attempt to adjust the positions of both cards without looking at them and without knowing which card each spectator is thinking of. Place the deck under the table or behind the back. Pretend to adjust certain cards but in fact do nothing.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Bring the deck into view and deal the top ten cards into a heap on the table. Place the balance of the deck alongside the ten-card packet. Explain that you are going to deal cards off the top of both packets. When either spectator sees his card, he is to call stop. If you are lucky, both cards will turn up at exactly the same instant.</p>
<p class="p-indent">All that remains is to deal cards off the top of each packet. If you handled the trick exactly as described, the thought-of cards will turn up simultaneously.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title16"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">13. THE MAGIC 13</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">This trick is the creation of Sam Schwartz. It produces the same type of effect as in the above routine, but takes a different path to achieve the end result.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Explain that the number 13 possesses properties both lucky and unlucky, both common and mysterious. To illustrate one of the mysterious properties, have someone deal 13 cards from the top of any shuffled deck. While you turn your back, have this fellow remove a portion of the 13-card packet and hand the balance of the packet to another spectator.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Each spectator counts the cards he holds and remembers the number. Let’s say that spectator “A” remembers that he has 5 cards, and spectator “B” remembers that he has 8 cards. Of course the magician is unaware of how many cards each person holds.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Ask that “A‘s” cards be placed face-down on the table. Then have “B’s” cards placed face-down on top of “A’s” cards. Request either spectator to give the 13-card packet a good shuffle just to make sure the cards are well mixed. Then take the packet and deal the cards one at a time off the top into a face-up heap. Ask “A” and “B” to remember the card at the position corresponding to the number each person has in mind. In this case, “A” would remember the 5th card you deal and “B” would remember the 8th card you deal.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When you’ve dealt all 13 cards into a face-up heap, turn the heap face-down and then deal the packet into two face-down heaps, alternating a card to each heap, dealing first to the left, then to the right, then to the left, then to the right, etc. When you finish dealing the 13 cards, you will have a heap of seven cards on the left, a heap of six cards on the right.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Turn the left-hand heap (the one with seven cards) face-up. Simultaneously deal cards off the top of each heap. When one spectator sees his card being dealt off the face-up heap, he is to call stop. When he does, show that the corresponding card you’ve just dealt off the face-down heap is the other spectator’s chosen card.</p></div></div>
