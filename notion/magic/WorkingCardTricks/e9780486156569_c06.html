<a id="title49"/><h1 class="title-chapter"><span class="b">TEST CONDITIONS</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">Like the last chapter, this chapter deals with mental effects, but there is a difference. Here we will consider those routines which are done under seemingly rigid test conditions, where—even if the spectator suspects the possibility of chicanery—it would appear impossible for the demonstration to succeed.</p>
<div class="section1"><a id="title50"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">43. BLIND DICE #1</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">The first part of this routine is adapted from a trick associated with Kuda Bux. The second part (“Blind Dice #2”) is a variation suggested by the author. Needed is any deck of cards and dice, two for the first part, three for the second.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Have the deck thoroughly shuffled and cut by the spectator. Remove two dice from your pocket and toss them onto the table. While you turn around or leave the room, the spectator rolls the two dice and adds together the two top numbers. If these are, for example, a 6 and a 3, the spectator would remember the total 9. Then one of the dice is turned over and the new number added to the total. Thus, if the new number were a 4, the total thus far would be 13. Finally, the spectator picks up this same die and rolls it. Whatever number comes up is added; if the number that came up were a 5, the grand total would be 18.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The spectator then notes a card at a corresponding position down in the deck. In our example, the spectator would note the 18th card from the top of the deck.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The magician turns around, picks up the deck and immediately finds the chosen card.</p>
<p class="p-indent"><span class="i">Method:</span> When you turn around to take the deck, glance at the two dice on the table. Mentally add their numbers together, then add 7 to the result. This automatically tells you the location of the spectator’s card in the deck. In our case you would arrive at a total of 18, and would go on to remove the 18th card from the top of the deck. If the audience asks to see the trick again, proceed with the following variation.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title51"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">44. BLIND DICE #2</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">Add a third die to the two dice on the table, saying that this will make it a bit harder. Turn your back. The spectator rolls the three dice and adds together the top faces. Then any two dice are turned over and the new numbers on top added to the remembered total. Finally, one of these two dice is pocketed by the spectator. The other die of the two dice is thrown at random, and the number thrown on this die is added to give the spectator a grand total which he alone knows.</p>
<p class="p-indent">He looks at a card at a position from the top of the deck which corresponds to the grand total. The magician, who may be out of the room until this point, takes the deck and instantly finds the chosen card.</p>
<p class="p-indent"><span class="i">Method:</span> When you take the deck from the spectator, glance at the two dice on the table. Add together the numbers on top of the two dice. Then add 14 to this to arrive at a grand total. Whatever this total is, it tells you the location of the chosen card in the deck. Thus, if the total is 20, you know the spectator’s chosen card is 20th from the top of the deck.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The trick is puzzling because only two of the dice are seen, the third die being hidden in the spectator’s pocket. Although the trick is automatic in operation, do not make it look too easy; pretend to have difficulty getting the proper mental impression, hesitate, change your mind, then finally decide on the right card.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title52"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">45. HOCUS-POCUS</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">Three small packets of cards are dealt onto the table. While the magician turns his back, a spectator chooses any one of the packets, shuffles it, mentally decides on one card in the packet, and then shuffles the packet again.</p>
<p class="p-indent">This packet is sandwiched between the other two packets to make sure the mentally chosen card is really buried. Neither the magician nor the spectator knows where the thought-of card is, and of course the magician has no idea of the identity of the thought-of card.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The spectator is asked to deal five heaps of cards from the packet. He is to continue dealing a card to each heap until he has dealt out all of the cards in the packet. Then, while the magician still keeps his back turned, the spectator locates the heap that contains his mentally chosen card, and places this heap in his jacket pocket.</p>
<p class="p-indent">For the first time the magician turns around and faces the spectator. Reviewing the impossibly strict conditions, including the fact that the spectator has shuffled, cut and thought of a card without the magician ever seeing or touching the cards, the magician says he will try to find the spectator’s chosen card by a telepathic process known as psychometry. With this process the magician will seek to find the one card in the spectator’s pocket which the spectator himself has chosen as his own card.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The magician reaches into the spectator’s pocket and immediately withdraws the thought-of card!</p>
<p class="p-indent"><span class="i">Method:</span> This trick, the invention of Eddie Joseph, can be built up to a feat of remarkable powers because the magician in fact never touches the cards nor does he have the slightest idea which card was chosen by the spectator.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The key to its success is in the casualness of the handling. You must make it appear that your initial handling of the cards is unimportant. Presented as such, the spectator will promptly forget that the magician ever touched the cards.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When the shuffled deck is handed to you, deal or push off a bunch of cards. It should look like a random number of cards, but in fact the packet must contain five cards exactly. Place this packet on the table. Remove another packet of five cards and drop them on the table. Then remove a final packet of five cards and place them on the table. At this point there will be three heaps of cards on the table, each containing five cards. Again, it must be stressed that you should not appear to be counting the cards or handling them with precision. It must look as if you are dropping three bunches of cards on the table.</p>
<p class="p-indent">From this point on you turn your back and do not handle the cards again. Ask the spectator to pick up one of the packets and shuffle it. Then ask him to look at one of the cards in the packet and remember it. A strong point now is that you ask him to shuffle the packet again so that even he does not know the location of his chosen card.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Tell him to place his packet between the other two packets. Then ask him to deal five heaps of cards. He deals in the conventional way, from left to right, dealing a card at a time to each heap until he has dealt all 15 cards. When he has finished dealing, he will have five heaps on the table, each containing three cards.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Ask him to find the heap containing his thought-of card, and to place this heap in his jacket pocket. When he has done this (your back has been turned all this time), turn around and review the proceedings thus far, emphasizing that you never touched the cards.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Reach into the spectator’s pocket and simply take the <span class="i">center</span> card of the packet of three. Remove it from the spectator’s pocket and dramatically reveal it as the selected card.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title53"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">46. OUT OF SIGHT</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">A spectator chooses a card and places it in his pocket. He then shuffles the deck and hands it to the magician. The magician drops the deck into his own pocket and without looking at the cards, he removes one from the deck. The spectator shows the card he chose—the 5D for example. The magician then shows the card he selected while the deck was in his pocket—it is the 5H, the other red Five.</p>
<p class="p-indent"><span class="i">Method</span>: Before the trick begins, place one of the red Fives in your jacket pocket. Then position the other red Five so it lies 10th from the top of the deck. This preparation is done secretly, as you do not want the audience to be aware of this setting-up procedure.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When ready to perform the trick, place the deck face-down in the left hand. Ask the spectator for a number between 10 and 20. Say he names 17. Slowly count 17 cards off the top, one at a time, dealing them into a pile on the table.</p>
<p class="p-indent">After you have dealt the 17 cards, say to the spectator, “To make this even more random, we’ll use the two digits in the number 17. Taking 1 and 7, we add them together and arrive at a total of 8.” As you talk, pick up the packet of cards you dealt onto the table and replace them on top of the deck. Then deal 8 cards off the top one at a time. Give the 8th card to the spectator and tell him to place it in his pocket for safekeeping.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Instruct the spectator to assemble the deck and shuffle it thoroughly. Then take the deck from him and drop it in your jacket pocket, that is, the pocket which contains the red Five. Pretend to concentrate for a minute, as if trying to fathom the card in the spectator’s pocket.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Remove three or four cards from the deck one at a time, and toss them out onto the table. Each time shake your head and say, “No, that’s not the one I want.” Pause dramatically and say, “I think the next one will be it.” Remove the red Five from the pocket and hold it face-down in the hand. Have the spectator remove his chosen card and show it to the audience. Remark that he chose a red Five. Then turn your card over to show that you chose the other red Five.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title54"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">47. LONG DISTANCE</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">Astonishing as it may seem, it is possible to perform card tricks over the telephone. This means that the magician, calling from a house that may be a town or a state away from the spectator, can reveal a card chosen by the spectator under conditions that are the most stringent imaginable; not only is the magician away from the deck when the card is being chosen, he may be hundreds or thousands of miles away!</p>
<p class="p-indent">Credit for devising the basic idea of a telephone trick is given to John Northern Hilliard. Over the years many clever minds have devised methods of performing a trick over the telephone. The following presentation, suggested by Audley Walsh, is one of the most impressive.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Call up a friend and explain that you would like to try a test in telepathy over the telephone. Ask him to bring a deck of cards to the phone. When he has done this, ask him to cut the deck into two approximately equal piles.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Then ask him to choose one of the piles and discard the other. He is to shuffle the chosen pile thoroughly. Then tell him to count the cards in this pile.</p>
<p class="p-indent">He will arrive at a two-digit number for his total, but caution him not to tell you the number. Instead, he is to mentally add together the two digits. Then he is to discard from his selected pile the same number of cards as the total of the two digits.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Instruct him to think of a number from 1 to 10, remove that number of cards from the chosen pile, and place them in his pocket. When he has done this, have him count down in the remainder of his selected pile to the same thought-of number and remember the identity of the card that lies at that position in the pile.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Now for the first time you ask him for some information. Tell him to hold his selected pile face-down in his left hand, deal cards one at a time off the top, and name them out loud to you. When he has read off all the cards, you immediately name the card he chose. Then as a topper you tell him the number of cards he has concealed in his pocket.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The method is easy and is never suspected. Before you call the spectator, bring a pad and pencil to the telephone. Instruct the spectator in the handling of the cards exactly as described above. When you reach the point where the spectator begins calling out the names of the cards one at a time, jot them down in a vertical column on the pad.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When he’s finished calling out the cards, count the number of cards listed on your pad. Whatever this number is, subtract it from 18. If your result is, for example, 6, then the spectator’s chosen card is the 6th one from the beginning of your list, and further, the spectator has exactly six cards in his pocket!</p>
<p class="p-indent">On rare occasions you will find that the spectator will call out more than 18 cards. If he does, then your factor becomes 27; subtract the number of cards he calls out from 27. Then proceed with the remainder of the trick exactly as written above.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title55"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">48. THE PHONE MIRACLE</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">This version of the telephone trick was devised by J. G. Thompson, Jr., the brilliant magician/mentalist. If you have performed the preceding trick, “Long Distance,” for friends, and are asked at a later date to do the trick again, Mr. Thompson’s routine is ideal. It rests on an entirely different premise and will therefore be even more baffling to audiences.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Call up a friend and have him bring a deck of cards to the phone. Ask him to cut off about one quarter of the deck, count the cards in the packet he cut off and deal from the packet two piles of cards: one pile is to contain the same number of cards as the first digit of the total and the second pile is to contain the same number of cards as the second digit of the total.</p>
<p class="p-indent">For example, if he cut off a packet of 14 cards, he would deal one card into the first pile and four cards into the second pile. When he has done this, ask him to shuffle the remaining cards in the packet he cut off the deck and look at the bottom card of this packet. This will be his chosen card. He then replaces the packet on top of the deck.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Finally, he is to gather up the two small piles he dealt (in our example the small piles consist of one card and four cards, respectively) and place them on the bottom of the deck.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Now have a second spectator come to the phone. Tell him to transfer the top card to the bottom of the deck. This signals the deck that you are ready for the thought experiment. Tell him to think of a number between 10 and 20, but not to tell you what it is. Whatever number he has thought of, he is to deal that many cards off the top of the deck into a pile on the table. When this has been done, ask him to place the balance of the deck aside, as it will not be used.</p>
<p class="p-indent">This spectator adds together the two digits of the mentally chosen number. Whatever the result, he deals that many cards off the packet and places them aside. Then from the remainder of the packet he deals the top three cards in a row on the table. Tell him to name the three cards, calling them either from left to right or from right to left, but without telling you which way he is calling them.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Despite the fact that you do not know either number, that you do not ask any questions and that you do not even know if the deck itself is complete, you proceed immediately to name the card chosen by the first spectator.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The secret is remarkably simple. Of the three cards dealt by the second spectator, the center card will always be the chosen card. Thus it does not matter whether the spectator calls out the cards from left to right or right to left; the second card he calls out must be the chosen card in either case.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title56"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">49. A CARD AND A NUMBER</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">Properly performed, this is an unfathomable card mystery. The only requirement is that a deck of 52 cards must be used. The effect is one where a card randomly selected by one spectator is made to appear at a position in the deck freely designated by another spectator.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Ask spectator “A” to give the deck several shuffles and cuts. Then ask him to think of a number between 1 and 10. Tell him to remove that many cards from the deck and conceal them in his pocket. In other words, if he thought of the number 6, he would remove six cards from the deck and place them in his pocket.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Then have spectator “A” note the card that lies at the corresponding position from the top of the deck. In our example, spectator “A” would note the card that lies 6th from the top of the pack. All of this is done while the magician has his back turned or is out of the room. He has no idea of the number chosen by spectator “A” and it is this fact which makes the trick so puzzling.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Now explain that you want someone else to name a number. To make certain this number is nowhere near spectator “A’s” number, you ask that this number be between 25 and 40. Say that the number 32 is called out.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Tell the audience that you will attempt the impossible by placing “A‘s” card at a position exactly 32 from the top of the deck. You will do this even though you do not know “A’s” card or where it lies. And further, you will do it without looking at the cards.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Place the deck behind your back. Starting at the next number after the one called out, you count cards off the top one at a time, transferring each card to the bottom of the deck. You continue counting until you reach the number 52. In our example, the number called out was 32. You will thus begin your count on the number 33. Transfer cards from top to bottom one at a time, each card corresponding to a number as you count from 33 to 52.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When you have done this, bring the deck back out into view. Again ask for the number called out. Since it is 32 in our example, count cards off the top of the pack, beginning at 1 and continuing until you reach 32. Turn up the last card dealt and it will be the card noted by spectator “A.”</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title57"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">50. MAGIC BY PROXY</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">In this version of the telephone trick, you do not need to make a call. In fact, the telephone is never lifted from the receiver. As the audience sees it, a card is chosen and replaced in the deck. You, the magician, never touch the deck. Then, <span class="i">without</span> lifting the phone from the receiver, you dial the number of a psychic friend. You explain that he can receive telephone messages by direct mind reading, a fact which is naturally reflected in a minuscule phone bill at the end of each month.</p>
<p class="p-indent">After you dial his number, you wait about a minute. Then the telephone rings. It rings exactly twice and then stops. A few more seconds go by. The phone begins ringing again. This time it rings three times and then stops.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Turning to the spectator who holds the deck, you say, “The phone rang twice and then three times. This indicates the number 23. Would you count down to the 23rd card in the deck?” The spectator does, and is astonished to find his card at exactly that position in the deck.</p>
<p class="p-indent"><span class="i">Method:</span> The entire working of the trick depends on two things; the first is a brilliant placement idea of Gerald Kosky’s and the second is nothing more than a little discussion, before performing the trick, with your friend who is going to play the part of the psychic.</p>
<p class="p-indent">This is how it works. Tell your friend that at ten o’clock on such-and-such a night you are going to perform this trick. He is to ring you at about ten after ten, let the phone ring twice and then hang up. He is then to dial you back immediately, let the phone ring exactly three times and again hang up.</p>
<p class="p-indent">That is all he needs to know. On the appointed evening, at ten o’clock, you mention that you would like to perform an experiment in extrasensory perception. Ask for the loan of a deck of cards. It must contain 52 cards.</p>
<p class="p-indent">You do not touch the deck at any time. Ask a spectator to shuffle the deck. Then tell him to remove a small number of cards—up to 15 cards—count them and drop them in his pocket.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Then tell him to count down from the top of the deck to the same number and remember the card at that number. When he has done this, tell him that there is a certain card in the deck that acts as the mystic link between the spectator’s mind and the psychic’s. Ask the spectator to deal off the top card, name it and place it on the bottom of the deck.</p>
<p class="p-indent">He is to continue dealing cards off the top one at a time, naming them and placing them on the bottom until you tell him to stop. You pretend to be listening for a particular card, but in fact you mentally count the number of cards he deals and call stop when he has dealt exactly 29 cards from top to bottom.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When he has called out the 29th card—say the Five of Clubs—and placed it on the bottom, suddenly call stop and add, “That’s it, the Five of Clubs! All right, we have the psychic link. I can call my friend.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Go to the phone, but do not lift the phone from the cradle. Simply dial any number. Glance at your watch so that you can gauge how close it is to ten after ten. You can stall a bit if you still have a few minutes to wait before your psychic friend calls you back. In any event, at ten after ten the phone will ring twice and then stop. There will be a slight pause; then the phone rings three times and stops.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Ask the spectator to look at the 23rd card from the top of the deck. Since you never touched the cards, he will be amazed that his card is exactly 23 from the top. Properly performed, this is as dramatic a demonstration of telepathy as you could wish for.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title58"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">51. SIGNED, SEALED AND DELIVERED</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">If you know in advance that you will have a chance to perform a few magic tricks at an office party, banquet or any other social function scheduled at least a week in the future, you can take advantage of the occasion to perform a sealed prediction feat that appears to have no solution except genuine telepathy.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Before the evening of the banquet, write on a piece of paper, “The chosen card will be the Seven of Spades.” Fold the prediction and seal it in a small envelope. Seal this envelope in a larger envelope. Finally, write a note to the banquet chairman, saying, “On the night of———[fill in the correct date] , please bring the enclosed sealed prediction to the banquet. You may also wish to bring your own deck of cards, because at that time I shall try an experiment in clairvoyance, and wish to observe the strictest test conditions.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Place the sealed prediction and the note to the chairman in an envelope and send the envelope to him. You can call him ahead of time to alert him to the package he is going to receive. Merely ask for his cooperation in keeping the prediction in a well-guarded place until the night of the banquet, to prevent any suspicion of tampering.</p>
<p class="p-indent">On the evening of the banquet, borrow a deck of cards or use one of your own. Have it well shuffled by anyone in the audience. Then take it back and state that you want to be certain the deck does not contain a Joker. Look through the pack for Jokers. In fact, you are looking for the Seven of Spades. Cut the 7S to the top of the deck. If you spot any Jokers in the pack, discard them, but this point is unimportant; your reason for looking through the deck is to get the 7S to the top.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Now hand the face-down deck to the banquet chairman. Ask him to lift off a portion of cards from the top, turn this portion face-up, and place it (still face-up) onto the balance of the deck. When he has done this, ask him to turn the entire deck over, and to spread it from left to right on the table.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Instruct him to remove the first face-down card in the middle of the deck. This will be the face-down card directly to the left of the face-up portion of the deck. Have him show this card to all those present. The card will be the Seven of Spades, an outcome guaranteed by the handling. Then have him open the prediction envelope and read aloud the prediction, verifying that you were 100% correct.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The ingenious method used here to force the Seven of Spades was developed by Lin Searles, and has many applications in card work.</p></div></div>
