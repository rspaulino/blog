<a id="title33"/><h1 class="title-chapter"><span class="b">MENTAL MAGIC WITH CARDS</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">Interest in paranormal feats has always been high, and because of the upsurge of interest in magic generally, there has been a dramatic increase in the attention shown toward mentalism. The mentalist has one thing going for him that the magician does not; whereas tricks are generally accepted as clever sleight-of-hand, mentalism is assumed to be <span class="i">real</span> magic. Thus, if you present a mental effect as a demonstration of supernormal ability, the audience will not look for sleight-of-hand because they assume there is none to be found anyway.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The present chapter and the one titled “Test Conditions” exploit themes in the area of mental magic, telepathy, prophecy, direct mind control, and so on. Presented as demonstrations or experiments in the unknown, they will be accepted as real magic by almost any audience.</p>
<div class="section1"><a id="title34"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">28. THE CARD REVEALED</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">Before performing this trick, note the top and bottom card of the deck. We will say the top card is the Four of Spades and the bottom card the Jack of Clubs. Hand the deck to the spectator and turn your back.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Ask him to think of a number from 1 to 13. He deals that many cards off the top of the deck, notes the last card dealt, and replaces the dealt packet on top of the pack. Then he gives the deck a cut and completes the cut.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Take back the deck and run through the cards with the faces toward you. Spot the two Key Cards (the Four of Spades and Jack of Clubs in our example). Count the number of cards between them and add 1 to this number. The result may be 8. This tells you that the spectator originally thought of the number 8.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Now cut the deck so that the Key Card that was originally on the bottom is back on the bottom of the pack. Again using our example, the Jack of Clubs, the original bottom card, would be cut to the bottom of the deck. This leaves the spectator’s chosen card on top of the pack, but you do not reveal this fact yet.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Since the spectator thought of the number 8, look through the pack, remove two Eights and place them face-down on the table side by side. Say to the spectator, “I can’t decide what number you were thinking of, but I’m almost certain it was one of the numbers represented on these cards. Fate will guide us to the right choice.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Have the spectator pass his hand over each card and finally decide on one. Pick up the other one and bury it in the deck. Then ask him for his thought-of number. It will be 8. Have him turn over the card he chose and it too will be an 8-spot.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Then ask, “Now we come to the hard part. What card did you choose?” After the spectator names it, turn over the top card of the deck and it will be his chosen card. This routine was a favorite of J. W. Sarles, and it is his presentation which is described.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title35"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">29. THE HAUNTED NAME</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">“Centuries ago a man named Johan Junius, mistakenly believed to be possessed by demons, was burned at the stake. His name became associated with mystic phenomena, and his initials still possess strange powers.” With this as background, you perform the following demonstration. Have the deck shuffled and cut. When you take it back, glimpse the bottom card. Place the deck on your outstretched palm. Have a spectator remove a group of cards from the middle of the deck, shuffle them and place them on top of the deck. Then ask the spectator to write a large “J” on the back of the top card, to indicate the initial of Johan Junius’ first name.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When he has done this, ask him to cut the deck and complete the cut. Invite him to cut the deck several more times. Taking back the deck, spread it face-up on the table from left to right. Spot your Key Card, the original bottom card you glimpsed. Then remove the card immediately to the right of this card and mark a large “J” on its face to indicate the last initial in the name Johan Junius.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Return this card to the deck, square the deck and give it several cuts. Have the spectator spread the deck face-down on the table. Let him remove the card bearing the “J” that he wrote. When he turns this card face-up, he finds the “J” that you wrote!</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title36"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">30. THOUGHT SPELLER</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">A spectator is given a packet of cards and asked to merely think of one of the cards and then mentally spell out the name of the card. The packet is replaced on top of the deck and the deck dropped into the magician’s pocket.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Turning to another spectator, the magician asks that person to merely think of his or her lucky number. The magician removes cards from his pocket one at a time while the spectator mentally counts to his number. When he reaches the number, he calls stop.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The magician removes the next card from his pocket (a spectator can even do it since there is no secret move made) and the first spectator’s thought-of card is discovered. Thus, a card merely thought of by one party is found at a number merely thought of by another party!</p>
<p class="p-indent"><span class="i">Method:</span> The secret is simple but well concealed. On top of the deck is a small stack of cards. From the top down the stack reads: Five of Diamonds, Three of Diamonds, Six of Clubs, Ten of Spades, Eight of Clubs, Queen of Hearts.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Remove this packet of six cards from the top of the deck without disturbing the order of the set-up. Hand the packet to the spectator. While your back is turned, he fans the cards so he can see the faces, and he thinks of any card in the packet. When he has done this, have him close up the packet, turn it face-down and hold it in his left hand.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Now instruct him to mentally spell out his card, but as he does so, he is to transfer a card at a time from top to bottom of the packet, transferring one card for each letter. If he thought of the Three of Diamonds, for example, he would spell T - H - R - E - E - D - I - A - M - O - N - D - S, transferring a card for each letter from the top to the bottom of the packet.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When he has done this, have him drop the packet back on top of the deck and square the deck. Take the deck and place it in your pocket. Unknown to all those present, the thought-of card is now on top of the deck. It would be too obvious to merely reach into the pocket and produce the thought-of card, so you disguise the revelation in the following way.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Ask another spectator to think of his or her favorite number. Explain that you will remove cards one at a time from the pocket; the spectator is to stop you when you have counted out a number of cards equal to the favorite number.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Reach into the pocket and begin removing cards one at a time from the <span class="i">bottom</span> of the deck, placing each on the table. Continue removing cards until the spectator calls stop. Then remove the top card of the deck, bring it out of the pocket and show it to be the chosen card.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title37"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">31. THE DUPLEX MIND</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">The secret to the success of most tricks lies in the degree of mystery evoked during the routine. Of themselves, cards are everyday objects and therefore lack mystic or mysterious properties. But you can still use cards in a dramatic context by introducing a mystic-seeming amulet or odd coin. Such objects can be picked up at a modest sum from antique shops or stores catering to coin collectors. The following routine demonstrates how an amulet can be made to seem the center of attention of the mystery, whereas, in fact, its presence in terms of method is mere window-dressing.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Before beginning the routine, arrange to have the Ace of Clubs on top of the deck and the Ace of Spades on the bottom. Any two cards can be used, but it is easy to remember the black Aces.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Now remove the amulet from your pocket and patter about its psychometric properties, its ability to focus thoughts and anything else you can think of that will add to the air of mystery.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Turn your back. Ask spectator “A” to cut off about half of the deck and turn it face-up on the table. Have him note the card he cut to.</p>
<p class="p-indent">In <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c05.html#int_18" id="ref_int_18">Figure 18</a>, spectator “A” would note the face card of the packet on the left, in this case the Three of Diamonds.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_text"><div class="image_text"><img alt="e9780486156569_i0019.jpg" src="images/e9780486156569_i0019.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-c"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156569_c05.html#ref_int_18" id="int_18"><span class="i">Figure 18</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">Ask another spectator to look at the top card of the other half of the deck (packet “B” in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c05.html#int_18">Figure 18</a>) and replace this card face-down on top of Packet “B.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Now ask spectator “B” to shuffle the face-up half of the deck into the face-down half. When he has riffle-shuffled the two halves together, tell him to give the deck a cut and complete the cut.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Turn around and face the audience. Pick up the amulet and remark, “While you were selecting cards, the amulet acted as silent observer to your actions. Though it cannot speak, it remembers what it saw and can sometimes convey this information to me.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Spread the deck on the table from left to right. The audience will see a completely random mixture of face-up and face-down cards. Hold the amulet at the fingertips and pass it over the spread of cards. When you spot the Ace of Clubs, note the first face-up card to the <span class="i">left</span> of it. This will be the first spectator’s card. Do not hesitate or give any indication that you know the chosen card. Instead, shake your head and say, “I’m picking up a faint vibration. Perhaps it will work better if we turn the deck the other way.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Note that you already know the first spectator’s card but you delay revealing this fact. Instead you act just the opposite, as if you do <span class="i">not</span> know the card and hope you’ll have better luck with the deck facing the other way. Scoop up the deck, turn it over, and spread it on the table from left to right.</p>
<p class="p-indent">As you slowly move the amulet over the cards, spot the position of the Ace of Spades. The first face-up card to the <span class="i">right</span> of this Ace will be the card chosen by the second spectator. When your hand passes over this card, allow the amulet to fall onto the deck. Say, “The amulet was drawn to the Nine of Clubs (or whatever the second spectator’s card happens to be). Did either of you choose that card?”</p>
<p class="p-indent">One of the spectators will acknowledge that he chose the Nine of Clubs. At this point hand the amulet to the other spectator and say, “The impression of your card is still weak. Perhaps you did not direct your full concentration to your card. Hold the amulet while you concentrate on the card.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Give him a few seconds to concentrate, then take back the amulet and hold it on your outstretched palm. Nod and say, “I’m beginning to see the card now. A red card, wasn’t it?” You then go on to name the first spectator’s card.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title38"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">32. PRE-FIGURED</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">This is another example of the “Lazy Magician” theme discussed elsewhere in this book. In this case, however, the spectator does all the work and succeeds in revealing the identity of <span class="i">two</span> cards.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Tell the spectator that you are going to think of a card whose identity he is to reveal later. Run through the deck and remove any 3-spot, say the Three of Spades. Do not let the spectator see the card you chose; after you remove it from the deck, place it face-down in the center of the table.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Now hand him the deck and tell him to think of a card also. It can be any card except a picture card. When he has removed his card, place the deck aside and hand the spectator a pencil and pad of paper.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Instruct him to write down on the pad the value of his chosen card. Then instruct him to double this number. If he chose the 9C for instance, he would write the number 18 on the pad. Tell him to add 2 to the result, multiply the total by 5, and subtract 7 from the final number.</p>
<p class="p-indent">He announces the final number, which might be 93. Then turn over his card to reveal that it is a 9, and turn over your card to show that it is a 3, exactly matching the final number.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title39"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">33. THREE ON A MATCH</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">This trick starts out as a serious demonstration of mind-reading under relatively strict test conditions, but then it takes an unexpected turn with an amusing finish.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Tell the audience you would like the assistance of three spectators for an experiment in telepathy. As the three assisting spectators step forward, pick up the deck and spread the cards so that only you can see the faces. Remove seven red cards and place them face-down in a heap on the table. Then remove a black card and place it face-down on top of the heap.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Place the deck to one side as it will not be needed. Then pick up the eight-card packet and hand it to the first spectator. Explain that he and the other two spectators will choose cards by a purely random procedure. With the cards in his own hands, he places the top card on the bottom of the packet, the next card onto the table, the next card under the packet, and so on, until he has one card remaining in his hand.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Tell him to look at and remember this card. He then places it face-down on top of the packet that lies on the table. The cards are squared and this eight-card packet given to the second spectator. He uses the same elimination shuffle to arrive at a random selection. When he has noted his card, he drops it on top of the tabled packet.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The packet is passed to the third spectator. He too uses the same elimination shuffle to arrive at his selection. When he has noted his card, he places it on top of the packet. Then he picks up the packet and gives it a good mixing so that no one knows any of the cards.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Play up the fact that you have not touched the cards from start to finish. Explain that you will now try to find the three chosen cards by purely telepathic means. All that is required, you add, is concentration and the ability to find those cards which appear to stand out from the others.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The spectator holding the packet is asked to deal the cards into a face-up row on the table. When he has dealt out all eight cards, say, “Now all I have to do is find those cards which seem different from the others.” The situation should get a laugh because there is <span class="i">one</span> and only one card which is different from the rest—the lone black card in the midst of a packet of red cards. At first pretend you do not notice this rather odd situation. Then slowly push the one black card out and place the balance of the packet aside.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Act puzzled that there is only one such card. Then have each of the three spectators name his card. They should be surprised to discover that each of them chose the same card, and in all three cases it was the lone black card!</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title40"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">34. COMPUTER MIND</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">Years ago Bob Hummer devised a card effect in which the magician was able to reveal a card merely thought of by a spectator. As time went by a number of clever improvements were suggested to the original trick. The following version, devised by Ray Grismer, is one of the best.</p>
<p class="p-indent">As mentioned, this is a method of determining a card merely thought of by a spectator. To perform it you must secretly note the bottom card of the deck and the card second from the top.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When this preparation has been accomplished, give the deck to the spectator and tell him to <span class="i">think</span> of any card. Turn your back and tell him that if he thought of a Club or a Heart, he is to deal <span class="i">one</span> card onto the table and drop the deck on top. If the thought-of card was a Spade or a Diamond, he does not deal any cards. Remember this first step as “Round One.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Now tell the spectator that if his card was red to deal two cards onto the table. If his card was black, he is to deal three cards. When this has been done, he is to drop the deck onto the cards he dealt onto the table and carefully square up the deck. Remember this as “Round Two.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Now tell the spectator to deal onto the table a number of cards equal to the <span class="i">value</span> of the thought-of card. When he has done this, he drops the deck onto the tabled packet and again carefully squares up all cards.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Take the deck from the spectator at this point. Turn it face-up and run the cards singly from left to right so you can see the faces. Recall that in the beginning of the trick you secretly glimpsed the bottom card and the card second from the top. Beginning at the face of the deck, push cards over to the right. Mentally count the number of cards you have to deal <span class="i">before</span> you reach the first Key Card (the original bottom card of the deck). Then count the number of cards <span class="i">between</span> the first and the second Key Cards. This is all the information you need to reveal the identity of the spectator’s thought-of card.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The number of cards <span class="i">between</span> the Key Cards gives you the suit of the thought-of card as follows:
</p>
<div class="tableau"><table class="none">
<col width="53.57%"/>
<col width="46.43%"/>
<tr>
<td align="right" class="filet_x filet_x " valign="top">Clubs</td>
<td align="left" class="filet_x filet_x " valign="top">3 cards</td></tr>
<tr>
<td align="right" class="filet_x filet_x " valign="top">Hearts</td>
<td align="left" class="filet_x filet_x " valign="top">2 cards</td></tr>
<tr>
<td align="right" class="filet_x filet_x " valign="top">Spades</td>
<td align="left" class="filet_x filet_x " valign="top">1 card</td></tr>
<tr>
<td align="right" class="filet_x filet_x " valign="top">Diamonds</td>
<td align="left" class="filet_x filet_x " valign="top">no cards</td></tr></table></div>
<p class="p-indent">Now that you know the suit, you can determine the value of the thought-of card. If the thought-of card was a Club or a Heart, the number of cards before the first Key Card is the value of the thought-of card.</p>
<p class="p-indent">On the other hand, if the thought-of card was a Spade or a Diamond, subtract one from the number of cards before the first Key, and this is the identity of the spectator’s thought-of card.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title41"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">35. THE STOP TRICK</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">The secret to this trick, credited to Annemann, was at one time sold in a manuscript costing $50. In effect a spectator’s card is found by means of a number merely <span class="i">thought of</span> by another spectator.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The top 13 cards of the deck are stacked. From the top down the set-up is K – Q – J – 10 – 9 – 8 – 7 – 6 – 5 – 4 – 3 – 2 – A. The King is the top card of the deck. Remove the Joker from the deck, turn it face-up and place it on the bottom of the deck.</p>
<p class="p-indent">To perform the trick, spread the deck between the hands and have a card chosen from the center of the deck. While the spectator shows the card to the others present, secretly count off thirteen cards from the top of the deck. Lift these cards off as a packet and have the spectator’s card returned. Then place this packet on top of his card. Square up the deck. Then cut the deck and complete the cut. Tell him that his card will be found by means of a number thought of by another spectator. As you talk, casually cut the deck two or three times. Then pretend to notice that there is a card accidentally reversed in the deck. Spread the deck until you come to the face-up Joker. Cut the deck at that point so the Joker is the top card. Remove it from the deck, saying, “The Joker shouldn’t be in the deck anyway.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Now have someone think of a number from 1 to 10. Ask him to name his number. If it is 9, slowly count nine cards off the top of the deck. Ask him if he wants the last card you counted or the next one on top of the deck. If he says the next one, turn that card face-up. Whatever number shows on this card, count that many cards further into the deck. The last card you count will be the chosen card.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title42"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">36. SENSITIVE FINGERTIPS</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">In this routine, the invention of Jack Avis, the magician is given a shuffled deck of cards behind his back. Without looking at any cards, and by means of his supersensitive fingertips, the magician is able to “read” the values of the cards one at a time while they are behind his back. In a final test, the magician reveals the names of two more cards while the deck is in the spectator’s hands.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_net"><div class="image_net"><img alt="e9780486156569_i0021.jpg" src="images/e9780486156569_i0021.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156569_c05.html#ref_int_19" id="int_19"><span class="i">Figure 19</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent"><span class="i">Method:</span> Six cards are secretly removed from the deck and hidden under the belt in back. These six cards will be the AC – 4H – 7S – 10D – 8S – KC, in that order from top to bottom. <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c05.html#int_19" id="ref_int_19">Figure 19</a> shows how they are clipped under the belt. They may also be held in place with a large paper clip, or kept in the back pocket, but for ease of handling, it is recommended that the packet be clipped under the belt as shown.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Have the balance of the deck shuffled by the spectator. Take it behind your back. Remove the packet from under the belt and add it to the top of the deck. Tell the audience about your supersensitive fingertips. Pretend to rub the fingers on the top card of the deck. Say, “This feels like an Ace, possibly a black Ace. Yes, it’s the Ace of Clubs.” Bring out the top card and show that it is the Ace of Clubs.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Repeat the same procedure for the second card, naming the Four of Hearts, then bringing it out and tossing it onto the table. For the third card, do <span class="i">not</span> name the Seven of Spades. Name the Eight of Spades, but bring out the Seven of Spades. Quickly flash the face of this card, but do not give the audience time to study the face.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Tell the spectator you will try a more difficult feat. Have him cut the deck and complete the cut. Now pick up the face-down Seven of Spades, call it the Eight of Spades again, and put it on top of the deck. Then have the spectator cut the deck and complete the cut to bury this card.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Now tell him to step away and remove the card on either side of the Eight of Spades. When he has done this, pretend to concentrate, and then reveal that these cards are the Ten of Diamonds and the King of Clubs.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title43"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">37. THINK OF AN ACE</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">Beforehand arrange the Aces in the deck as follows: the Ace of Clubs about 10th down from the top, the Ace of Hearts about 20th from the top, the Ace of Spades 30th from the top and the Ace of Diamonds 40th from the top.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When ready to present the routine, hand the spectator the deck and remark on the fact that the Aces, because they represent the highest cards in the deck, have a fascination about them that other cards do not have. To illustrate, ask the spectator to think of an Ace. Tell him to fan the cards so he can see the faces, find the thought-of Ace, and upjog it slightly so he can see the face of the card.</p>
<p class="p-indent">As you talk, walk away from the spectator so your back is turned to him. Remove another deck from your pocket and say that you too will think of an Ace. Just as you say this, turn and face the spectator, and note the approximate position of the upjogged Ace in his deck. Of course you will see only the backs of the cards in his deck, but with very little practice you should be able to judge immediately whether his thought-of card protrudes from the deck near the top (in which case it would be the Ace of Clubs), nearer to the center (the Ace of Hearts), about two-thirds of the way down from the top (the Ace of Spades) or near the bottom (the Ace of Diamonds).</p>
<p class="p-indent">While this may sound difficult at first reading, it is an easy knack to pick up. In time you will be able to judge the approximate location of the upjogged Ace by the merest glance. Thus, the audience will never remember that you turned back to look at all.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Once you have spotted the position of the upjogged Ace, and hence know its identity, turn your back to the spectator. Run through your deck and remove the same Ace. Hold it over your head, with the back of the card to the spectator.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Have him remove his card from his own deck. Both of you then show your chosen Ace to the audience, and it is seen that the Aces are identical. In performing this trick you will find that a curious “aftereffect” develops. When describing the trick later on, people will forget that the choice was restricted to the four Aces; instead they will swear that the fellow from the audience chose any card and that you matched it in some miraculous manner.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title44"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">38. POCKET PREDICTION</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">This is an adaptation of a first-rate trick credited to Rufus Steele. Tell the spectator that you will try to predict a card he is going to choose. To make sure there is no tampering with the prediction, tell him that you will give him the card to hold.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Taking a borrowed, well-shuffled deck from the spectator, turn the cards face-up so that you alone can see the faces. Spot the top card of the deck. We will say it is a 9-spot. Silently count in to the 9th card from the face of the deck, and note this card. It may be the Five of Spades.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Find the “twin” of the Five of Spades, in other words, the other black Five. Remove this card from the deck and hand it face-down to the spectator as your prediction. Tell him to place it in his pocket for safekeeping.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Now turn the deck face-up and begin dealing cards one at a time off the face into a face-up heap on the table. Continue dealing until you have dealt past the Five of Spades, then say to the spectator, “Call stop at any time.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">When he calls stop, pick up the face-up packet from the table, turn it face-down and place it in front of the spectator. Tell him that he will choose a card from this packet.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Now turn the balance of the deck face-down in your hand and begin dealing cards off the top. Tell the spectator to call stop at any time. When he does, pick up the tabled packet you have just dealt, turn it face-up and point to the face card of the packet. Say to the spectator, “This card is a 9-spot, so count down to the 9th card in your packet.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">The spectator counts to the 9th card and turns it face-up. It will be the Five of Spades. “You chose a black Five,” you remark. “Now check this against the prediction card I gave you before we began the trick.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">The spectator removes the prediction card from his pocket and finds that it is the other black Five, a perfect match.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title45"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">39. PSYCHIC MAGNET</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">Tell a spectator that certain cards have an affinity for certain objects. For example, you say, the Two of Spades is magnetic and is easily attracted by a magnet. To illustrate, you hold a deck of cards in your hand, and throw a handkerchief over the deck. A borrowed pencil, suitably charged by a psychic field, is held over the deck, and the Two of Spades immediately rises out of the deck, clinging to the pencil as if it were in fact responding to some kind of magnetic field. All objects may be borrowed, and all may be left with the spectator at the finish of the demonstration.</p>
<p class="p-indent"><span class="i">Method</span>: Shuffle and cut the deck. As you square up the cards, glimpse the top card of the deck. If it is the Two of Spades, then this is the card you mention as being peculiarly susceptible to psychic magnetism.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Hand someone a pencil. Tell him to gaze at it and imagine it is a solid ferrite magnet. As he does this, cover the deck with a handkerchief. A light silk handkerchief works best, but a cotton or linen handkerchief is also suitable.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Take the pencil and hold it over the deck. Touch the top of the deck with it. Do not be in a hurry to perform the trick. The longer you delay, the more “genuine” the experiment appears. After trying it two or three times without success, hand the pencil back to the spectator and ask him and one or two other spectators to concentrate harder on making the pencil magnetic. While attention is directed to the spectators and the pencil, secretly moisten the tip of your right little finger.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Take the pencil again and place it on top of the deck. Then, behind the cover afforded by the silk, push the little finger against the handkerchief so it comes in contact with the top card of the deck. Then lift the right hand slowly, all the while maintaining pressure, and the card will “rise” out of the deck as if magnetically attracted to the pencil; see <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c05.html#int_20" id="ref_int_20">Figure 20</a>. The key to making this a convincing demonstration of psychic magnetism is to focus all attention on the pencil and not on the cards.</p>

<div class="section1"><a id="title46"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">40. FATE #1</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">Cards and dice are articles common to many gambling games, yet they are seldom used together in the same game. The reason (you explain) is that when used in conjunction with one another, they produce strange, sometimes unexpected results. To demonstrate, you use two dice and a deck of cards. The dice can be shaken in a leather dice cup if such an item is available, but otherwise the two dice may be shaken in a teacup or other opaque container.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The spectator shakes the dice and tosses them out onto the table. Whatever number shows up on the dice, the spectator deals that many cards from the top of the deck into a packet on the table.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The spectator then turns either die over and notes the new top number. Whatever it is, the spectator counts that many additional cards off the deck and onto the packet already on the table. The deck itself is placed aside at this point.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Calling attention to the other die, the one not turned over, the magician calls out the top number and requests that the spectator count that many cards off the top of the packet into a separate heap on the table.</p>
<p class="p-indent">There are two small packets of cards on the table. “Isn’t it odd,” the magician remarks, “that the random throw of the dice gave you just the right cards needed to open a game of draw poker?” So saying, he turns over the top card of each small packet, revealing a pair of Jacks!</p>
<p class="p-indent"><span class="i">Method:</span> Beforehand, arrange two black Jacks so they are 6th and 7th from the top of the deck. Then simply proceed as described above. Regardless of the numbers thrown by the spectator, the end result will always be a pair of Jacks.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title47"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">41. FATE #2</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">This is a different version of the above trick. The patter story is the same. The spectator rolls two dice and totals the top numbers. Whatever the total, he counts that many cards off the top of the deck into a face-down heap on the table.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The spectator then covers one of the dice with the cup. This leaves the other die in view. Direct the spectator to turn this die over so the bottom number is now on top. Have him note the new number and deal this many additional cards onto the packet already on the table.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Remark on the fact that the spectator rolled a completely random number with the two dice. Point out also that one die is still hidden under the cup, its identity known only to the spectator. “But such is the sympathy that exists between cards and dice,” you add, “that one card was fated to be dealt.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Turn up the top card of the packet on the table. It will be a Five. Then have the cup lifted from the die. The top number on the die is also seen to be a Five, a perfect match.</p>
<p class="p-indent"><span class="i">Method:</span> Arrange the Ace, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six in mixed suits on top of the deck in numerical order, Ace at the top, Six on the bottom. With this packet on top of the deck, you proceed with the trick exactly as written above. It will always turn out that the last card the spectator deals matches in value the top face of the die hidden under the cup.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title48"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">42. DOUBLE PROPHET</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">Two cards chosen in the fairest possible manner with the deck in the spectator’s own hands are found to match two predictions written by the performer and sealed in envelopes before the demonstration began.</p>
<p class="p-indent">To make the predictions as impressive as possible, write on a slip of paper, “You will pick the 8H and also. . . .” Don’t complete the prediction. Instead, fold it in half, drop it in an envelope, seal the envelope and mail it to yourself. On a second slip of paper, write “. . . and also the Queen of Clubs.” Fold this prediction in half, drop it into a separate envelope, seal the envelope and mail it to yourself.</p>
<p class="p-indent">You will thus have two sealed envelopes, each containing part of the double prediction, and each clearly sealed and officially dated prior to the evening you intend to perform the trick.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_text"><div class="image_text"><img alt="e9780486156569_i0023.jpg" src="images/e9780486156569_i0023.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-c"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156569_c05.html#ref_int_21" id="int_21"><span class="i">Figure 21</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">On the night you do the trick, secretly perform the following preparation. Place the Eight of Hearts on top of the deck and the Queen of Clubs on the bottom. Then turn the bottom half of the deck around so it is face to face with the top half of the deck. <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c05.html#int_21" id="ref_int_21">Figure 21</a> shows the condition of the deck and the relative position of the two prediction cards at this point.</p>
<p class="p-indent">To perform the trick, hand the deck to the spectator and tell him to place it behind his back. The top card of the deck is the face-down Eight of Hearts at this point.</p>
<p class="p-indent">With the deck behind his back the spectator is instructed to lift off about a quarter of the deck and turn it face up on top of the pack. When he has done this, tell him to lift off about two-thirds of the deck and turn it over onto the balance of the deck. When he’s done this, take the deck from him.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Spread the cards from left to right, saying that you will use the last face-down card near the top of the deck and the first face-down card near the center of the deck. As you begin spreading the deck you will first come across a group of face-down cards. Run through these until you come to the last face-down card in the top group. Upjog this card. It is shown as “A” in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c05.html#int_22" id="ref_int_22">Figure 22</a>.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_text_net"><div class="caption"><p class="p"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156569_c05.html#ref_int_22" id="int_22"><span class="i">Figure 22</span></a></p></div>
<div class="image_text_net"><img alt="e9780486156569_i0024.jpg" src="images/e9780486156569_i0024.jpg"/></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">You will next encounter a group of face-up cards. Push these to the right until you come to the first face-down card of the next group. Upjog this card. It is shown as “B” in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c05.html#int_22">Figure 22</a>. Square up the deck and remove the two upjogged cards. Then call attention to the two sealed envelopes that you previously placed on the table. Have the first one read aloud. Then explain that the second prediction came in the mail a day after the first. Have the second envelope opened and the prediction read aloud. It is seen that both of the chosen cards have been correctly predicted.</p>
<p class="p-indent">If you want to make the predictions more impressive, burn each prediction slip around the edges and sign each, “Beelzebub.” You can later explain that while it is true Beelzebub is referred to as the prince of demons, he is also a good golfer (a 3 handicap), and rather talented at writing predictions when he is not out on the golf course raising—er, heck. You then proceed with the above trick.</p></div></div>
