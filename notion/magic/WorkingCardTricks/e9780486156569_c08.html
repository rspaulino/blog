<a id="title64"/><h1 class="title-chapter"><span class="b">REVELATIONS</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">The card expert who desires to entertain as well as baffle his audience knows that the key to an entertaining card effect lies almost entirely in the novel way a chosen card is revealed. The tricks in this chapter were selected with this end in mind; each is an entertaining and amusing way of revealing a chosen card.</p>
<div class="section1"><a id="title65"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">56. THE 3½ OF CLUBS</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">This trick, a variation of a routine marketed some years ago, is a most unusual way of revealing a chosen card. Prior to the performance, place the Seven of Clubs on top of the deck. This is the major preparation. To present the trick, run through the cards, saying you will remove a prediction card. Slip the prediction card (the Three of Clubs) into the card case for safekeeping.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Then ask the spectator for the first name of anyone close to him. He might say “Jane.” Spell J - A - N - E, dealing a card off the top of the deck for each letter. Explain to the spectator that you want him to spell to a card in the same way. Pick up the cards you have just dealt onto the table and replace them on top of the deck.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The spectator takes the deck, spells J - A - N - E, dealing a card off the top for each letter, and looks at the last card he dealt. This card will be the Seven of Clubs, but of course you pretend you do not know the name of the card.</p>
<p class="p-indent">After he has looked at his card, tell him that your prediction inside the card case will be the same suit as his card and exactly half the value. If he reflects on this for a second, he will realize the impossibility of your claim; since he chose the 7C, your prediction, in order for it to be <span class="i">exactly</span> half the value of his card, would have to be the 3½ of Clubs.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Ask him to name his card. He does, and you act a bit taken aback, as if you too realize your predicament. Then say, “As a matter of fact, I did place the Three and a half of Clubs in the card case.” Reach into the card case and remove the 3C. Then tip the card case up, allowing a half dollar to slide out. Say, “There it is, the three . . . and a half.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Of course it should be clear that you secretly placed the half dollar in the card case prior to performing the trick.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title66"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">57. THE GEIGER COUNTER CARD TRICK</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">This amusing and bewildering card trick perfectly exemplifies how a novel premise can be used to bring about an effect so different that it is certain to be remembered by audiences. Any deck is used.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Explain to the audience that when cards are handled by the audience, the energy level of the cards will increase. You further explain that certain cards, like the Ace of Spades, are sensitive to these energy changes and can detect them in much the same way that a geiger counter detects radiation.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Run through the deck and toss out the Ace of Spades. As you do, have ample opportunity to remember the top card of the deck.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Place the deck face-down on the table. Invite a spectator to cut off about half the deck and invite him to pick up the top half. Then have him remove a card from that half, drop it on top of the packet and cut the packet to lose the chosen card. Then have him drop this half of the deck on top of the other half, and give the complete deck another cut to further insure that the chosen card is completely lost in the pack.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Take the deck, turn it face-up and spread it on the table from right to left. Place your left hand on the card at the extreme left of the spread. Simply rest the hand on this card to keep it in place. With the right hand take the Ace of Spades and run it from left to right across the spread so that the lower index corner slides along the cards as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c08.html#int_25" id="ref_int_25">Figure 25</a>. As the hand moves from left to right (in the direction of the arrow), the index corner of the Ace clicks along from card to card; if done at a moderate speed, the series of clicks that is produced sounds surprisingly like the clicks that are produced by a geiger counter or scintillation counter.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_text_net"><div class="image_text_net"><img alt="e9780486156569_i0027.jpg" src="images/e9780486156569_i0027.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-c"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156569_c08.html#ref_int_25" id="int_25"><span class="i">Figure 25</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">If the right hand grips the Ace tightly, the clicks are loud and sharp. If the right hand relaxes its grip, the clicks become softer. This is the key to the mystery. When you spread the deck face-up on the table, spot the Locator Card (the one you glimpsed as being the top card of the deck). The card just to the right of it is the spectator’s card.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Starting with the Ace of Spades at the far left side of the spread, hold it loosely in the right hand and run the card from left to right. When you get near the chosen card, increase pressure slightly on the Ace of Spades and the clicks will become noticeably louder. Repeat this action several times, finally homing in on the area around the Key Card. Then bring the Ace of Spades to a stop when it is resting directly on the spectator’s chosen card. Name the chosen card and have the spectator confirm that he did indeed choose this card.</p>
<p class="p-indent">This clever and baffling trick was devised by John Cornelius and is a variation of a trick developed by Jerry Andrus.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title67"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">58. OPPOSITES ATTRACT</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">This novel routine uses the four Kings and the four Queens. Explaining that the old saying, “Opposites attract,” holds true even with playing cards, the magician has the spectator choose four cards from the packet of eight. When the cards are paired, it is found that the spectator has successfully paired each King with a Queen.</p>
<p class="p-indent"><span class="i">Method:</span> Any deck may be used. Tell the audience that you will use the Kings and Queens. Hold the deck so that only you can see the faces. Run through the cards and remove the four Kings, placing each face-down into a common heap on the table. Then remove the four Queens and place these onto the Kings. You must get across the idea that you are removing Kings and Queens randomly as you come to them. Thus, as you remove each of them, you might say something like, “Here’s a Queen, and here’s a King . . . here’s another King, etc.”</p>
<div class="illustype_image_text"><div class="caption"><p class="p"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156569_c08.html#ref_int_26" id="int_26"><span class="i">Figure 26</span></a></p></div>
<div class="image_text"><img alt="e9780486156569_i0028.jpg" src="images/e9780486156569_i0028.jpg"/></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">Spread the cards on the table from left to right so they overlap. Then ask the spectator to pull any four cards out of the spread. He should pull each out about halfway. There is no restriction on his choice. He can choose any four cards. The four cards he may decide on are shown as the upjogged cards in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c08.html#int_26" id="ref_int_26">Figure 26</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When he has decided on four cards, carefully square the packet, still keeping his cards outjogged. Then strip out the four upjogged cards as a block and place this packet face-down on the table. Pick up the remaining four cards and say, “I want to be sure there are four cards in each group. I don’t want to miss any.” Count these four cards onto the table, one card on top of the next, thus reversing their order.</p>
<p class="p-indent">You now have two packets on the table, each face-down. Pick up the top card of each group. Comment again about how opposites attract. Then turn these two cards over together to show a King and a Queen. Repeat with each of the next three pairs of cards, and in each case you will find a King paired with a Queen.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title68"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">59. 60 SECONDS FLAT</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">A card that is freely chosen by a spectator is returned to the deck, whereupon the chosen card vanishes completely from the deck and penetrates the tabletop. It takes exactly 60 seconds for the chosen card to work its way through the tabletop. At the end of that time, when it has dropped through, it is caught in the middle of the deck in a face-up or reversed condition.</p>
<p class="p-indent">A skeptical spectator may wish to sign the card at the beginning of the routine just to insure that you are not using trick cards, but in fact the deck is ordinary.</p>
<p class="p-indent"><span class="i">Method:</span> Before beginning the trick, secretly reverse the bottom card of the deck. We will assume this card is the Jack of Diamonds. With the deck face-down in the left hand, the bottom card is the face-up Jack of Diamonds. Naturally the audience is unaware of the presence of this reversed card.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Spread the cards from hand to hand and have one chosen. We’ll say it is the Ace of Hearts. The card may be signed. Place it face-down on the table. Then place the deck face-down on top of this card. Press down on top of the deck with the right forefinger, saying that this will cause the spectator’s card to leave the deck and slowly penetrate the table.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Remarking that it takes exactly 60 seconds for the chosen card to make its way through the tabletop, you add that this is just enough time to show the audience that the card really has vanished from the deck. Pick up the deck and place it into the left hand.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Push off the top ten or twelve cards, turn them face-up and show that the signed Ace of Hearts is not among them. Place this group of cards face-up on the table. Drop the face-down deck on top of these cards.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Pick up the deck and return it to the left hand. Push off another dozen or so cards from the top of the deck and show the Ace of Hearts is not among them either. Place this group face-up on the table. Then drop the face-down deck onto this group.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Repeat the above process of taking cards off the top, showing them and placing them face-up on the bottom of the deck until the Jack of Diamonds shows up. Stop at this point, because the audience will assume that they have seen the face of every card in the deck, and that the signed Ace has truly vanished.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Keeping the deck face-up, cut it and complete the cut. Say to the audience, “Your card should be just about completely through the tabletop. Maybe I can catch it as it falls through.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Place the face-up deck under the table and rap it up against the tabletop. Bring the deck up into view and spread it face-up on the table. There will be one face-down card in the center, and when it is turned over it will be the spectator’s signed card.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title69"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">60. PERSONALITY</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">Tell the spectator that many people believe in the practice of numerology. It is well known that everyone has a certain unique number associated with his or her character. Then add, “I would say, for instance, that you are an honest, decent person. These qualities are denoted by the numbers 5 and 3. Therefore, if my guess is correct, you are a 5-3 personality.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Hand the spectator a small packet of cards and tell him to place them behind his back. Say, “Let’s see if I’m right. Shuffle the cards I’ve given you. Then turn the top card of the packet face-up, and turn the bottom card of the packet face-up. Shuffle the cards after you’ve done this.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Repeat the above process as often as the spectator likes. Each time he reverses the top and bottom card, and then gives the packet a shuffle. When he has finished, have him bring out the packet and spread it on the table. Five cards will point one way and three cards the other, exactly as you stated.</p>
<p class="p-indent"><span class="i">Method:</span> This trick was created by Bob Hummer. Before doing it, count off eight cards and place them in your jacket pocket. When they are in the pocket, secretly turn the bottom card of the packet over so it is reversed.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When ready to perform the trick, explain how personality traits are determined by numbers. Tell the spectator that he looks like a 5-3 personality. Then remove the packet from the pocket and hand it to him behind his back.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Have him follow the procedure outlined above for reversing pairs of cards and shuffling the packet. After he has done this several times, he brings the packet out into view and finds that five cards face one way and three the other. On rare occasions you will find one card facing one way and <span class="i">seven</span> the other; should this happen, simply remark, “I was wrong. You’re one of a kind.”</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title70"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">61. JUMPING JOKER</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">This is possibly one of the most dramatic ways of revealing a chosen card. After the card is returned to the center of the deck, the magician snaps the end of the deck. The Joker literally jumps out of the deck, and right next to it is found the chosen card.</p>
<p class="p-indent">There is some slight preparation but it is worth it because of the extremely visual nature of the effect. Remove the Joker from the deck and tear off the lower right quarter as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c08.html#int_27" id="ref_int_27">Figure 27</a>. Discard the lower quarter, as it is not needed. Now turn the Joker over side-for-side and drop the deck on top of it. The Joker thus becomes the bottom card of the face-down deck, and the missing corner is at the lower left.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Spread the deck and have a card chosen. Tell the spectator to replace it on top of the deck. Then cut the deck at about the middle and complete the cut to lose the chosen card.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Thus far all is fair. Tell the audience that through years of dedication, self-denial, etc., you’ve managed to teach the Joker to find cards for you. All you have to do, in fact, is riffle the deck and the Joker will pop up immediately at the right location.</p>
<p class="p-indent">As you talk, bevel the deck slightly so it looks like <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c08.html#int_28" id="ref_int_28">Figure 28</a>. Then grasp it at the lower left corner by the left thumb on top, first finger below.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The right fingers now riffle the outer or upper right corner of the deck, the portion marked “X” in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c08.html#int_28">Figure 28</a>. The riffle is begun at the face of the face-down deck and works toward the back. The riffle is done quickly, with a snap of the fingers. A few minutes’ practice will be enough to acquire the knack of doing this.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_text"><div class="image_text"><img alt="e9780486156569_i0029.jpg" src="images/e9780486156569_i0029.jpg"/></div>

<div class="image_net"><img alt="e9780486156569_i0031.jpg" src="images/e9780486156569_i0031.jpg"/></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">Odd as it may seem on reading this, the Joker will indeed pop up out of the center of the pack, as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c08.html#int_29" id="ref_int_29">Figure 29</a>. If you have never seen it before, it is a startling sight.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When the Joker has popped up into view, lower the deck so the backs of the cards are visible to the audience. The right hand then lifts up the Joker plus the cards above it and places these momentarily in the right jacket pocket. The right hand then turns over the top card of the deck and it is the chosen card.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The reason for placing the top half plus the Joker into the pocket is that you want to unload the Joker before the audience gets a chance to examine it. Leave the Joker in the pocket as you bring out the rest of the packet from the pocket. Shuffle this packet into the balance of the deck. If someone wants to examine the deck at this point, just make sure you have a regular Joker in the deck for them to find.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The idea of causing a torn-corner card to pop up out of the deck as described above is not new, but its use in the location of a chosen card is novel and sure to make an impact on the audience.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title71"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">62. CALCULATOR CARDS</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">This is a comedy effect suggested by Richard Himber in which a spectator’s card is “calculated” to be exactly six and three quarters from the top of the deck. Oddly enough, the calculation does prove to be exact.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_text"><div class="image_text"><img alt="e9780486156569_i0032.jpg" src="images/e9780486156569_i0032.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156569_c08.html#ref_int_30" id="int_30"><span class="i">Figure 30</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">Preparation is easy. Take a Joker and tear out a quarter of it. You can use the same Joker that was used in the “Jumping Joker” effect. The torn Joker is placed on the bottom of the deck. Above it are six more cards, then the face-up Two of Clubs, then the balance of the deck. The complete set-up is shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c08.html#int_30" id="ref_int_30">Figure 30</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When ready to present the trick, have a spectator choose a card from the middle of the deck. Square the deck and have the chosen card replaced on top, then cut the deck and complete the cut.</p>
<p class="p-indent">State that you use a certain Calculator Card that is absolutely infallible. Run the cards from hand to hand until you come to the face-up Two of Clubs. Cut the Two of Clubs to the top of the deck. Then place the deuce face-up on the table.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Say, “It’s all quite simple. Taking the value of the Two of Clubs, its relative location in the deck, the time of day and the logarithm of my license plate number, we arrive at a magic number, in this case—mmmm, exactly six and three quarters.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">With a self-satisfied look, you conclude, “In other words, your card is exactly six and three quarters down in the deck. Amazing, isn’t it?” The spectator, having never heard of a card being six and three quarters down in the deck, will be less than impressed, let alone amazed.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Slowly and dramatically you deal cards off the top, calling out, “1 . . . 2 . . . ” and so on, until you arrive at the card just before the torn Joker, which you count as 6. After dealing this card, deal the Joker, saying, “And three quarters, making a total of six and three quarters.” While the audience laughs at the gag, turn over the next card and show it is the chosen card.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title72"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">63. PROCESS OF ELIMINATION</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">A novel and offbeat way of revealing a previously chosen card, this is based on what is known as the “plunger principle,” credited to Jack McMillan.</p>
<p class="p-indent">A small amount of preparation is required. Arrange the 2S - 3S - 4S - 5S on top of the deck in that order, the 2S being the top card. With this done beforehand, you are now ready to present the trick. Spread the pack face-down between the hands and invite a spectator to choose a card from the middle. He can take any card except the top four cards of the deck.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When he chooses a card, square up the deck and place it on the table face-down. Have him drop his chosen card on top of the deck. Then have him cut the deck and complete the cut. Take the deck from him, turn it face-up so that you can see the faces, and run through the pack until you come to the 5S. You then upjog every other card beginning at the 5S and working back toward the top of the deck until you have five cards upjogged. <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c08.html#int_31" id="ref_int_31">Figure 31</a> shows the first four cards being upjogged. You will upjog one more at the left according to the above procedure.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_text"><div class="caption"><p class="p"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156569_c08.html#ref_int_31" id="int_31"><span class="i">Figure 31</span></a></p></div>
<div class="image_text"><img alt="e9780486156569_i0033.jpg" src="images/e9780486156569_i0033.jpg"/></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">Call attention to the fact that the face card of the upjogged packet is the Five of Spades. Then say, “We’ll find your card by a process of elimination.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Place the right forefinger on top of the upjogged packet and push down as indicated in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c08.html#int_32" id="ref_int_32">Figure 32</a>. Because of the plunger action of the interlaced cards, the upper packet slides in flush with the deck; at the same time another packet will be forced out the bottom of the deck, as in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c08.html#int_33" id="ref_int_33">Figure 33</a>. As soon as it appears, say, “We’ve eliminated the Five and now we have a Four.” Now push up on the lower packet so that it slides in flush with the deck. The result of this action is to force a smaller packet out from the top of the deck with a Three showing.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Push this packet down flush with the deck. A still smaller packet will be forced down and out of the bottom of the pack with a Two showing. Finally push this small packet up so it is flush with the deck. This time a single card will slide up and out of the top of the pack and it will be the card chosen by the spectator.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_text_net"><div class="image_text_net"><img alt="e9780486156569_i0034.jpg" src="images/e9780486156569_i0034.jpg"/></div>

<p class="p-indent">A few notes on the handling. In order for this trick to work smoothly the cards cannot be sticky or overly worn. If you find that the trick does not work the first few times you try it, chances are that you are not exerting enough pressure on the deck with the left hand. This is not to imply that the trick is difficult or unreliable in working. Once you acquaint yourself with the basic principle you’ll find that the trick works easily and infallibly.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title73"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">64. THE JOKER KNOWS</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">In this subtle routine, the creation of Theodore Annemann, the magician uses the All-Knowing, All-Seeing, etc., Joker to find the selected card. The omnipotent Joker does not do as well as advertised, and after repeatedly failing to find the chosen card, it changes into the chosen card itself. The fact that this happens with the Joker in the spectator’s hands when the change occurs adds much to the mystery.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Without the knowledge of the audience, you start with the Joker on the bottom of the pack. Spread the cards and have one chosen. Square up the deck, and place it on the table. Have the spectator drop his card on top, and then cut the deck to lose his card somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Take the deck and announce that you will use the All-Knowing, All-Seeing, And Other Favorable Qualities Too Numerous To Mention, Joker. Turn the deck face-up and look over the faces of the cards until you spot the Joker. However, you do not remove the Joker from the deck. Instead, you remove the card directly below it. Without revealing the face of this card to the audience but implying it is the Joker, place it face-down on the table (it is the chosen card).</p>
<p class="p-indent">Place the deck face-up on the table. Ask a spectator to insert the face-down “Joker” (really the chosen card) into the face-up pack at any point. When he’s done this, spread the deck face-up on the table. Point to the face-down card and announce, “The Joker has infallibly found your card. It is of course the card directly above the Infallible Joker.” The spectator will tell you that the card above the supposed Joker is not his.</p>
<p class="p-indent">“Of course I meant the card immediately <span class="i">below</span> the Infallible Joker.” No, the spectator says, that is not it either. Act disappointed and say, “When I think of how much I paid for this Joker. . . .” You then remember something. “Just out of curiosity, what card did you choose?” The spectator might say the Eight of Spades. You reply, “Yes, that was the <span class="i">one</span> card the Joker couldn’t find. When someone picks the Eight of Spades, here’s what happens.” Remove the face-down card (the supposed Joker) from the deck and snap your fingers over it. Then have the spectator turn it over to reveal that it has changed to his chosen card, the Eight of Spades.</p></div>

<p class="p-indent">Here you teach a spectator how to cut the deck in such a way that he has complete control over the cards. If, for example, he cuts to a 7-spot, a previously chosen card is found exactly 7 down from the top of the deck.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Secretly remove all 13 Hearts from the deck. Arrange them in order from Ace to King, with the Ace at the face or bottom of the packet and the King on top. Place the packet face-down on the table and then drop the face-down deck on top of the packet. Case the deck until you plan to perform this trick.</p>
<p class="p-indent">To present the routine, remove the deck from its case and then spread the cards and have one chosen from the middle. Square up the deck and place it on the table. Instruct the spectator to drop his card on top and then cut the deck to lose the chosen card.</p>
<p class="p-indent">It is at this point that a bit of acting comes into play. Pretend to notice something about the way he cut the deck. Have him cut the deck again and complete the cut. Ask him to do it once more, then once again and complete the cut. Ask him to do it once more, then once again. Each time you appear to notice something of particular interest about the way he cuts the deck. Remark that he has a light touch with the cards, exactly what is needed in controlled cuts.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Turn the deck face-up and have him cut the deck and complete the cut. Congratulate him, but add that he should use a lighter touch. Have him cut the deck again, and continue the process of encouragement. He cuts the deck again and again until a Heart shows up at the face of the deck. Stop him at this point and tell him he has done remarkably well. If the face card is the Seven of Hearts, call attention to its value. Then turn the deck face-down. Have the spectator deal off seven cards. The last card he deals will be his chosen card.</p>
<p class="p-indent">By way of a reference, I do not know the exact source of the principle used here, but believe Al Baker should be credited with the basic premise.</p></div></div>
