<p class="p-indent">If you have studied and mastered the tricks in the preceding pages, and have had an opportunity to try them out on friends, then you will have developed a certain self-confidence in the presentation of card effects. This means that you will be ready to tackle the tricks in this final chapter; they require a bit more study, a bit more attention to detail, but the end result should be worth it; in all cases, if properly presented, these card routines seem to lie beyond rational explanation.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Some, like “Quick as a Wink” (No. 72) and “Topsy-Turvy” (No. 71), are visually startling. Others, like the “O. Henry Card Trick” (No. 69; a favorite of J. W. Sarles), pack a double climax that the audience will not quickly forget. They are not meant to be presented one after another. Rather, you should intersperse these stronger routines with quick tricks like Locations and Poker Deals.</p>
<div class="section1"><a id="title76"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">66. FOLLOW THE LEADER</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">This classic effect dates back to the time of Robert-Houdin. There are many elaborate ways of bringing about the basic trick, some of them requiring sophisticated sleight-of-hand ability. The following is a simple method that achieves the desired end without sleight-of-hand. It is a variation of a method suggested by J. W. Sarles.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Invite a spectator to remove three red cards and three black cards from the deck. When he has done this, instruct him to arrange the cards so the colors alternate red-black-red-black-red-black from the top down. It is important to let the spectator alternate the colors so he is certain there has been no hanky-panky at this stage of the trick.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Take the packet from him and hold it face-up in the left hand. As you say “Remember that the colors alternate,” take the first card into the right hand. This is the face card of the face-up packet. As you take it, say “Black.” Then take the next card on top of it. Say “Red” as you take it. Then place this pair of cards in back of the packet.</p>
<p class="p-indent">For the second pair the handling is slightly different. Push the face card to the right and say “Black.” Then push the next card to the right and say “Red.” Take this pair of cards with the right hand and place them behind the packet. Note that here you do <span class="i">not</span> reverse the order of the two cards as they are taken into the right hand.</p>
<p class="p-indent">For the third and final pair of cards, take the first one into the right hand and say “Black.” Then take the next card on top of it and say “Red.” Place this pair of cards in back of the packet.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Turn the packet face-down and replace it in the left hand. Now deal from left to right, dealing the cards into two heaps, alternating the deal so the first card goes into the left heap, the next into the right heap, the next into the left heap, etc. As you deal, say, “Black, red, black, red, black, red,” making it clear to the audience that all the blacks are in the left heap, all the reds in the right heap.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Turn up the top card of each heap and place it above its own heap. Call these “Leader Cards.” As shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c09.html#int_34" id="ref_int_34">Figure 34</a>, the black Leader Card may be the Five of Spades. The red Leader Card will be the Six of Hearts.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Say, “The black cards are all on the left and the red cards are on the right. Let’s exchange the Leader Cards.” Pick up the 5S and the 6H, exchange them, and place the 5S still face-up but in front of the right packet. Place the face-up 6H in front of the left packet.</p>
<p class="p-indent">“If we exchange the Leader Cards like that, the colors will follow the leaders.” Pick up the top card of each face-down packet. Do not exchange them. Simply rub or touch the face-down card in the left hand on the red Leader Card and turn it face-up to show it has become red. Then touch the card in the right hand to the 5S, turn it over and show that this card has suddenly become black. The situation at this point is shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c09.html#int_35" id="ref_int_35">Figure 35</a>.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_text"><div class="caption"><p class="p"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156569_c09.html#ref_int_34" id="int_34"><span class="i">Figure 34</span></a></p></div>

<p class="p-indent">Place these face-up cards on top of their respective Leader Cards; in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c09.html#int_35">Figure 35</a> you would place the 4D face-up onto the 6H and the 2C face-up onto the 5S.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_text_net"><div class="caption"><p class="p"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156569_c09.html#ref_int_35" id="int_35"><span class="i">Figure 35</span></a></p></div>

<p class="p-indent">Then say, “We can exchange the other cards and it will still work.” Now openly exchange the two face-down cards. Pick up the one on the left, snap it face-up and show that it has changed into a red card. Then turn over the one at the right and show it has suddenly changed to a black card.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title77"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">67. MENTAL MIRACLE</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">To perform this seemingly miraculous feat, no special preparation or dexterity is called for. You can use any borrowed deck, and the trick is performed as soon as the deck is made available. While you turn your back, the spectator sitting across from you shuffles and cuts the deck. He then hands the deck under the table to you. From this point on, the deck is kept out of sight under the table. The mentalist (that is, you) spreads the deck and has the spectator select any card. The spectator returns this card anywhere in the deck and immediately takes the deck and shuffles it.</p>
<p class="p-indent">No one knows where the chosen card is, and from this point on the mentalist never touches the deck again. When the spectator is satisfied that the deck is well shuffled, he deals cards off the top one at a time and hands them under the table to the mentalist. As each card is taken, the mentalist concentrates for a moment, then shakes his head and says, “No, this isn’t it.” Each card is then placed face-down onto the table.</p>
<p class="p-indent">At some point the mentalist will be handed the card chosen by the spectator. When he gets it, he concentrates as before, then he says, “Yes, I think this is it. A black card, wasn’t it? The Four of Spades?”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Remember that the deck is borrowed, and is shuffled and cut by the spectator before and after he chooses a card. Also, once the chosen card is returned to the deck, the spectator keeps the deck, and he may shuffle it at <span class="i">any</span> time thereafter. This feat is strong enough to fool even well-versed magicians. Properly built up, it can become a feature mental effect for anyone who knows the secret.</p>
<p class="p-indent"><span class="i">Method:</span> As is the case with many of the most impressive tricks, this one rests on a simple premise. After the deck is shuffled and handed to you under the table, invite a spectator to remove any card. After he does, simply turn the deck over. This is done secretly, and since the deck is under the table, no one is aware of what you did.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The selected card is returned to the deck. Naturally the spectator, after looking at his card, returns it face-down into the deck, thinking that the deck itself is face-down. But in fact he is returning the card face-down to a face-up deck, so his card is automatically reversed in the pack. Once his card has been returned, turn the deck over so it is face-down, and immediately hand it under the table to the spectator for shuffling.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When he is satisfied that the deck is well mixed, ask him to give you cards one at a time off the top. The deck remains under the table. The spectator hands you the first card. Take it, pretend to concentrate, then shake your head and bring the card up and toss it onto the table. The card is face-down when the spectator gives it to you, and remains face-down when you bring it up from under the table.</p>
<p class="p-indent">But there will come a point where the card handed to you by the spectator is face-up. You will know this as soon as you <span class="i">begin</span> to bring the card up from under the table, but <span class="i">before</span> the card can be seen by the spectator. A very slight downward glance will allow you to see the face of this card. Place it back under the table as you say, “Wait a minute. I think this may be it. You chose a black card, didn’t you?” Then go on to name the card. Turn it face-down, bring it up from under the table and slowly turn it over to reveal it to be the chosen card.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The basic premise of this effect was devised by Joseph Dunninger, the eminent mentalist. The method is the author’s variation of an idea suggested by Clayton Rawson.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title78"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">68. TWINS</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">Two decks are used. Each deck is shuffled by the spectator and each deck is placed in a handkerchief. Taking a Joker in each hand, the magician slides each Joker under the handkerchief containing a deck. When the first Joker is removed, it has changed to the Four of Spades. When the second Joker is removed from under the other handkerchief, it too has changed to the Four of Spades!</p>
<p class="p-indent"><span class="i">Method:</span> You will need one red-backed deck and one blue-backed deck. Each deck must contain a Joker at the beginning. That is the only preparation, an easy matter to arrange even if using borrowed decks.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Explain to the audience that you will use just the two Jokers. Run through the blue-backed deck and remove the Joker. Let the audience plainly see the face of the Joker, then turn the Joker face-down and place it on the table. Hand the blue-backed deck to a spectator for shuffling.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Take back the blue-backed deck after it is well mixed and wrap it in a handkerchief. The handkerchief should be cotton or linen, preferably white, because as you wrap up the deck it is necessary to glimpse the bottom card of the deck through the handkerchief. Generally, a white handkerchief is translucent enough to allow you to glimpse the bottom card through a thickness of the cloth (this method of glimpsing a card was suggested by Nate Leipsig). We’ll say the glimpsed card is the Four of Spades.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Now say that you will remove the Joker from the red-backed deck. Run through this deck and pretend to remove the Joker. But in fact remove the Four of Spades and place it face-down on the table without the audience seeing the face of the card. Immediately hand the red-backed deck out for shuffling. Then have the spectator wrap it loosely in a second handkerchief.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Pick up the blue-backed Joker in one hand and the supposed red-backed Joker in the other. Say to the audience that you will slip each card back into its own deck momentarily. Remind the audience that the decks were shuffled and cut <span class="i">after</span> you removed the Jokers, so you could not possibly know a single card in either deck.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Slip the blue-backed Joker under the handkerchief around the blue-backed deck and slide the Joker into that pack. Remove the face card of the blue-backed deck (the Four of Spades in our example) and bring this card out from under the handkerchief in a face-down condition.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Then place the red-backed card—the supposed other Joker—under the handkerchief wrapped around the red-backed deck. Pause for a moment, then remove this same card.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Turn over the blue-backed card and show that the Joker has changed to the Four of Spades. Then turn over the red-backed card and show that it too has changed to the Four of Spades.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title79"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">69. O. HENRY CARD TRICK</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">One of the strongest types of card magic you can do is the trick which has a double ending. Thus, you perform a trick and bring it to a successful conclusion. Just when the audience thinks the trick is over, you then reveal a further climax even more startling than the original. The following is an example of the genre: you start out by performing a prediction trick, but then the trick takes a strange turn.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Required are 20 black cards and a single red card. We will say the red card is the Queen of Hearts. Place this card 10th from the top of the packet of black cards.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Place the packet on the table in a face-down condition. While you turn your back, ask a spectator to remove a small packet of cards from the top. He can remove from one to ten cards. Tell him to secretly count the cards and hide them in his jacket pocket.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Pretend to concentrate for a moment. Then jot down a prediction on a slip of paper. The prediction reads, “You will choose the Queen of Hearts.” Fold the prediction slip in half and in half again. Give it to a spectator to hold, specifying that they hold it at their fingertips so the prediction is in view at all times.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Now pick up the balance of the packet on the table. Deal cards singly off the top into a face-down row on the table, dealing <span class="i">from right to left,</span> until you have dealt a total of ten cards.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Ask the spectator how many cards he hid in his pocket, explaining that whatever the number, you will use this number to locate a card in a fair and random manner. Let us say he placed six cards in his pocket. Instruct him to count to the sixth card, beginning at the left end of the row and counting <span class="i">from left to right.</span> When he’s done this, he turns up the next card to the right. In our example it will be the Queen of Hearts.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The spectator entrusted with the prediction now opens the prediction slip and reads aloud that you correctly predicted the Queen of Hearts would be chosen.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The trick appears to be over. Have the spectator add his pocketed cards to those on the table. All cards are face-down at this point except the Queen of Hearts, but you pretend to notice something. Pause for a moment as if studying the cards. Then say, “That’s odd. Not only did you pick the card I predicted, but you picked the only red card in the entire packet.” As you say this, turn up bunches of cards until the entire packet is face-up and spread out on the table, revealing that every card is black except the chosen card.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The key to success in tricks of this type (as in all card magic) is the ability to act convincingly. You must give the impression that the entire point of the trick is a prediction. The second climax, where it is discovered that the spectator chose the only red card in a large packet of blacks, then comes as a baffling finish.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title80"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">70. ASTRO TWINS</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">In this amusing and puzzling trick, cards are chosen by two spectators and the chosen cards placed face-down on the table, side by side. Now the spectators change places. When the cards are turned up it is seen that they have acted in sympathy and they too have changed places.</p>
<p class="p-indent"><span class="i">Method:</span> For maximum dramatic impact, you should have the two spectators seated directly across the table from you. We’ll say spectator “A” is the spectator to your left and spectator “B” is the spectator to your right.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Tell them you will use a small batch of cards. You apparently take a haphazard number of cards off the top of the deck but in fact take exactly 20 cards.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Hand the packet to spectator “A.” Ask him to fan the cards so he can see the faces. Then have him note a card and its position from the top. Thus he might note the Five of Diamonds, which might be 10th from the top.</p>
<p class="p-indent">He squares the packet and hands it to spectator “B.” This spectator then fans the cards and also notes a card and its position. He might note the Queen of Spades, 12th from the top.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Take back the packet from spectator “B.” When you get the packet, say to the audience, “Let’s see how many cards we have.” Deal cards off the top of the packet into a heap on the table. Continue the deal until all cards have been dealt. Then, saying, “We have exactly 20 cards,” replace the packet in the left hand and casually transfer the top card to the bottom of the packet.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Ask each party for his number (position from the top). Add them together. The total will be either more or less than 20 (and on rare occasions exactly 20). If the total is more than 20, say, “We’ll need that many more cards to bring up our total.” In our case the total of the two numbers will be 10 plus 12, or 22. Thus, to bring the total up to 22, you must deal two cards off the top of the deck onto the packet. Now the packet contains 22 cards.</p>
<p class="p-indent">(If the total is less than 20, say, “In this case we won’t need all these cards.” Remove as many cards as necessary to make the number of cards in the packet equal to the total of the spectators’ numbers. To take an example, suppose spectator “A‘s” card was 5th from the top and “B’s” card was 9th. The total of these two numbers is 14. Thus, you would remove six cards from the top of the 20-card packet and discard them. This reduces the packet so it now contains exactly 14 cards.)</p>
<p class="p-indent">Remind the audience that you have no idea which card was chosen by whom. All you know is the location of each card. Count down in the packet to the number named by spectator “A” and place the card at that position face-down in front of him. Continue the count until you reach the other spectator’s number and place the card at that number in front of him.</p>
<p class="p-indent">“All we’ve done so far,” you say, “is give each of you your card back. But let me show you something odd. Would you get out of your chairs and change places?” Spectators “A” and “B” change places. For the unexpected finish you show that the chosen cards have acted in sympathy and have also changed places; instead of “A‘s” card being in front of spectator “B” and vice-versa, “A’s” card is in front of “A” once again, and “B’s” card is in front of “B!”</p>
<p class="p-indent">A note might be appropriate regarding those few cases where “A‘s” number, when added to “B’s” number, totals exactly 20. In these instances you do not add cards to your packet nor remove cards from the packet. Simply use the 20-card packet as is.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Also, in the above example you counted down to “A‘s” card first. This is because “A’s” number was smaller than “B’s.” In all cases you count first to the smaller of the two numbers and place that card before the appropriate spectator. Then continue the count to the larger of the two numbers and place the card at that number before the other spectator. The rest of the trick is as written.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title81"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">71. TOPSY-TURVY</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">Here the spectator brings about the magical reversal of two chosen cards with the deck in his own hands. The deck may be borrowed, as it is unprepared. The trick itself requires no skill.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Take the deck and spread it face-up on the table. Tell the spectator that you could have him pick a card with the deck face-up, but that you would rather have his choice be a completely random one. As you talk, note the card that lies second from the bottom or face of the deck. In <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c09.html#int_36" id="ref_int_36">Figure 36</a> this card is the 5S.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_text"><div class="caption"><p class="p"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156569_c09.html#ref_int_36" id="int_36"><span class="i">Figure 36</span></a></p></div>
<div class="image_text"><img alt="e9780486156569_i0038.jpg" src="images/e9780486156569_i0038.jpg"/></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">Square up the deck and turn it face-down. Invite the spectator to lift off about half the deck and place his cards behind his back. You then take the remainder of the deck (the bottom half) and place it behind your back.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Instruct the spectator to select a card at random from his half of the deck. You pretend to do likewise, but what you really do is to remove the bottom card, turn it over and replace it on the bottom of the packet. Then turn the second card from the bottom over in place. Finally, turn the entire packet over. The end result is shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c09.html#int_37" id="ref_int_37">Figure 37</a>. The previously noted card, the 5S in our example, is now the second card from the top of your packet.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_text"><div class="image_text"><img alt="e9780486156569_i0039.jpg" src="images/e9780486156569_i0039.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156569_c09.html#ref_int_37" id="int_37"><span class="i">Figure 37</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">You and the spectator bring your respective packets out in front. Tell him to look at the card he randomly chose. Then take his card and insert it face-down into the center of your packet. Remove the top card of your packet, pretend to look at it, and have the spectator bury it in the middle of his half of the deck.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When this has been done, tell him that he might be able to find his own card by a random process known as Transverse Deflection (this is gibberish, but it sounds impressive). Hand him your half behind his back. As your packet is placed behind his back, turn the packet over before he takes it. Then tell him to hold the packet at right angles to the floor and to give it a sudden sharp twist so it is parallel to the floor.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Take the packet back from him. Spread the cards and show that the sudden sharp movement caused his card to turn face up in the deck. Remove his card and drop it onto the table. Then drop your packet (still face-down) onto his packet and square the deck. Hand him the entire deck behind his back and ask if he might try by the same process to find your card (here you simply name the card you glimpsed at the beginning of the trick), the Five of Spades.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When he has gone through the Transverse Deflection business, have him bring the deck into view and to spread the cards between his hands. He does and finds the Five of Spades has mysteriously turned face-up in the deck.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title82"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">72. QUICK AS A WINK</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">This brilliant trick was originated by Reinhard Muller. The effect is direct and quite startling: a chosen card, hopelessly lost in the deck, suddenly appears between two Aces. The following handling is in part based on an approach described by Harvey Rosenthal.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Before the trick begins, secretly remove the two black Aces from the deck, turn them face-up and place them under the top card of the deck. The set-up thus looks like <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c09.html#int_38" id="ref_int_38">Figure 38</a>.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_text"><div class="caption"><p class="p"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156569_c09.html#ref_int_38" id="int_38"><span class="i">Figure 38</span></a></p></div>
<div class="image_text"><img alt="e9780486156569_i0040.jpg" src="images/e9780486156569_i0040.jpg"/></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">Place the deck on the table. Ask a spectator to cut off about half and to place the cut portion (the top half of the deck) off to one side for the moment.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Have him pick up the bottom half of the deck, shuffle it and note a card. Then direct him to place his card on top of the top half of the deck. Finally, he is to give his packet of cards one more shuffle and then drop this packet on top of the chosen card. After he has done this, tell him to carefully square the deck.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Tell him that before the trick commenced, you reversed the black Aces in the pack. As you talk, run the cards from hand to hand until you come to the reversed Aces. Cut the pack at this point and complete the cut so the Aces are the top cards of the pack (the spectator’s chosen card is second from the bottom at this point).</p>
<p class="p-indent">Deal the two black Aces onto the table. Remark that these two cards will help you find the spectator’s card. Then add, “I hope your card isn’t on the top or bottom.” When you say this, remove the bottom card, show it and place it in the center of the deck. Then remove the top card, show it and place it into the center of the pack. The spectator will agree that neither of these cards is his.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Now place the Ace of Clubs on top of the pack. Then grasp the deck from above with the right hand. The left hand places the Ace of Spades on the bottom of the pack, but this Ace is jogged or positioned to the left as indicated in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c09.html#int_39" id="ref_int_39">Figure 39</a>. The left hand now grasps the deck again as indicated in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c09.html#int_40" id="ref_int_40">Figure 40</a>. Note that both Aces are visible to the audience at this point.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_text"><div class="image_text"><img alt="e9780486156569_i0041.jpg" src="images/e9780486156569_i0041.jpg"/></div>

<p class="p-indent">The grip of the left hand is important. Note in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c09.html#int_41" id="ref_int_41">Figure 41</a> that the left first finger rests on the Ace of Spades, whereas the left middle finger rests on the bottom card of the deck. This bottom card, the 5H in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c09.html#int_41">Figure 41</a>, is the spectator’s chosen card. The left thumb, of course, rests securely on the top card of the deck, the Ace of Clubs.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The left hand now throws the deck into the right, using a sharp throwing motion. The left thumb holds back the Ace of Clubs, while the fingers beneath the deck hold back the Ace of Spades and the spectator’s card. The deck is caught by the right hand.</p>

<p class="p-indent">The result of the above action leaves the two black Aces in the left hand with the chosen card between them, as in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c09.html#int_42" id="ref_int_42">Figure 42</a>. Try it a few times and you will find it a startling visual effect.</p></div></div>
