<a id="title26"/><h1 class="title-chapter"><span class="b">COINCIDENCE TRICKS</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">The coincidence trick is one where the magician and a spectator each happen to choose the same card. In a variation of the basic premise, the trick can end with two different cards found in the same position in two different decks. Both aspects of this basic theme will be discussed in this chapter. It should be emphasized that the coincidence effect is one of the strongest in card magic. Since such tricks involve the simultaneous revelation of two cards rather than one, any thought of manipulation or control on the magician’s part appears to be completely out of the question.</p>
<div class="section1"><a id="title27"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">22. DO AS I DO</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">Under the heading of the “Do as I Do” trick is a type of card effect using two decks of contrasting back design or color. If you own a set of bridge cards, you will find that the backs of the decks are different colors. For this trick we will assume that one deck is red-backed and the other deck blue-backed. Since such contrasting decks are usually available when people get together to play bridge, this type of card effect is particularly suitable after an evening of bridge.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The following routine is the basic or classic form of the two-deck card trick, in which it turns out that the magician and the spectator choose the same card under seemingly impossible conditions.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The spectator uses the red-backed deck while the magician uses the blue-backed deck. Explain to the spectator that if each of you handles his deck in the same way, each of you should arrive at the same conclusion. Emphasize that the spectator is to do exactly what you do.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The magician shuffles his pack. The spectator does likewise. Each person then cuts his own deck. As you square up your deck, glimpse the bottom card. This becomes your Key Card. Of course the glimpse is done secretly.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Now exchange decks with the spectator. He has the blue-backed deck and you have the red-backed deck. Hold the deck in the left hand. Have the spectator do likewise with his pack. Then each of you reaches into the center of his respective deck and removes a card. Tell the spectator to look at his card. You pretend to look at your card.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Each person places his selected card on top of his own deck. Then each person cuts his own deck and completes the cut. Now you exchange decks again. The spectator gets back the red-backed deck and you get the blue-backed deck. Each person turns his own deck face-up so that he alone can see the faces of the cards. Each person then removes his card from the deck he holds. In fact, what you do is locate your original Key Card. Take the card immediately below it and place this card face-down on the table. The spectator does likewise with his deck.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Say, “If we both did the same thing, we should both arrive at the same result.” Have the spectator turn over his card so the audience can see it. Then turn over your card. Under the strictest test conditions, using two borrowed well-shuffled decks, it is seen that both you and the spectator have chosen exactly the same card, an amazing coincidence.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title28"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">23. THE ONE-DECK VERSION</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">There may be times when two contrasting decks are not available. If you wish to present the basic effect with a single deck, the following method will fill the bill.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Before presenting the trick, remove two cards of the same value and color, say the 4D and the 4H, and place them on the bottom of the deck. When ready to present the trick, place the deck face-down on the table. Ask the spectator to cut off the top half and keep that half for himself. You take the bottom half.</p>
<p class="p-indent">It is assumed that you are seated at the table across from the spectator. Each person places his half of the deck under the table. Tell the spectator to remove any card from his packet and hand it under the table to you. As soon as he gives you the card, place it on top of your packet. Then immediately ask, “Did you get a good look at your card?” He will say no. Remove the bottom card of your packet and hand it to him. Tell him to look at it and hand it back to you.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Take the card (it will be a red Four) and place it face-up in the middle of your face-down packet. Now remove the bottom card of your packet and hand it under the table to the spectator. Tell him to turn it face-up and place it in the middle of his face-down packet.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When this has been done, both packets are placed face-down to show that the reversed card in the center of each is a red Four.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title29"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">24. CHILD’S PLAY</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">In this trick you have two spectators pick cards. The cards are different, but they end up in the same position in two separate packets.</p>
<p class="p-indent">From a well-shuffled deck a spectator is asked to deal two equal heaps of cards. It makes no difference how many cards are dealt so long as each heap contains the same number of cards.</p>
<p class="p-indent">We’ll refer to the heaps as “A” and “B” as shown in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c04.html#int_16" id="ref_int_16">Figure 16</a>. Ask the spectator to pick up heap “A,” shuffle the cards and then note the face (bottom) card of the packet and return the packet to the table in a face-down condition.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Another spectator is asked to remove a few cards from heap “B,” mix the cards and note the face card of the small group. He then places this small group on top of heap “A.”</p>
<div class="illustype_image_text"><div class="image_text"><img alt="e9780486156569_i0017.jpg" src="images/e9780486156569_i0017.jpg"/></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="p-c"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156569_c04.html#ref_int_16" id="int_16"><span class="i">Figure 16</span></a></p></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">The combined heap at “A” is then dropped on top of whatever cards remain at “B,” and the complete packet squared. Now ask for the number of cards originally dealt into either heap. If 12 cards were originally dealt into each heap, deal 12 cards off the combined packet and place the dealt packet at “A.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">The undealt portion is turned face-up and placed on the table at position “B.” Explain to the audience that because the spectators chose cards in a similar way, they tend to act in sympathy. This is another way of saying that if two people handle cards in the same way, the outcome should be the same.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Deal cards simultaneously from both heaps. When one of the chosen cards shows up as it is dealt from the face-up heap, the spectator who selected this card is requested to call stop. Pause dramatically, then turn over the card you just dealt from the other heap. It will be the other spectator’s chosen card.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title30"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">25. UNSEEN POWERS</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">Although stemming from a straightforward premise, this routine of J. Stewart Smith’s uses a deceptively simple method to bring about a very strong coincidence effect. As a preliminary to the trick, have the four deuces on top of the deck in any order. Place the deck face-down on the table. Ask the spectator to cut the deck into two heaps, which we’ll call “A” and “B.” Assume that heap “A” is the original top half of the deck.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Pick up heap “A” and place it face-down in the left hand. Deal the top five cards off the top, tossing them out onto the table in different spots. The dealing should look haphazard, but in fact remember where you deal the fifth card.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Place heap “A” beside heap “B” again. Then pick up the last card you dealt, turn it face-up and hand it to the spectator. Tell him to tap each of the other four cards scattered on the table, and to stop on one card. When he decides on a card, leave that card on the table. Gather the remaining cards and place them on top of heap “A.” Then take the card the spectator used to tap the other cards, and place this on heap “A.” The only single card on the table at this point is the one chosen by the spectator.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Tell him to turn heap “B” face-up. Have him insert his card face-down in the middle of heap “B.” Then tell him to hold heap “B” for safekeeping. When he has done this, and his card is securely hidden in the middle of heap “B,” pick up heap “A” and say that you too will choose a card. Spread heap “A” face-up between your hands, so that only you can see the faces of these cards. You know that the spectator chose a deuce, but as yet you don’t know which one.</p>
<p class="p-indent">As you spread the cards with the faces toward you, note which deuce is missing. Then pick the deuce of the same color and remove it from the packet. For example, if you note that the Two of Diamonds is missing, pick the other red Two, the Two of Hearts, and remove it from the packet.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Close up the packet and turn it face-up. Place your card face-down in the center of this packet. Then have the spectator turn both packets face-down and spread them out. In each packet there will be a face-up card, and each will be a red Two.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title31"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">26. DOUBLE DISCLOSURE</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">The only thing needed in this version of the two-deck card trick is a pack of 52 cards. Two spectators participate. The magician never touches the deck, yet the two freely chosen cards end up at identical positions in two separate packets.</p>
<p class="p-indent">So that each spectator has the same number of cards to work with, request the spectator holding the deck to deal off 26 cards and give them to the second spectator. When this has been done, each spectator holds exactly half the deck.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Request each spectator to shuffle his own cards. Then have each person remember the top card of his half of the deck. One half is then placed on top of the other half of the pack. The assembled deck is then given a cut and the cut completed. The deck may be cut several times to insure that no one could possibly know the location of any card.</p>
<p class="p-indent">When the spectator is satisfied that no one knows any card in the deck, he counts 26 cards off the top of the deck, counting them one at a time into a heap on the table. He then places the balance of the deck on the table. One of the packets is chosen, and this packet is turned face-up.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Each spectator takes a packet. They simultaneously deal cards from the top of their respective packets (of course the spectator with the face-up packet is dealing cards off the <span class="i">face</span> of his packet, while the spectator with the face-down packet is dealing off the <span class="i">top</span> of his packet). When either spectator sees his card being dealt from the face-up heap, he calls stop. The card just dealt from the other heap is turned over and it proves to be the second spectator’s chosen card.</p></div>
<div class="section1"><a id="title32"/><h1 class="title-section1"><span class="b">27. ULTRA COINCIDENCE</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">We’ll close this chapter with one of the most amazing versions of the two-deck card trick, created by Martin Gardner. A double matching effect is achieved by the most economical means possible.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Two decks are used, one red-backed and one blue-backed. The spectator is asked to pick either deck. Assume he picks the red-backed deck. He shuffles this deck while you shuffle the blue-backed deck. Glance at the bottom card of his deck after he has finished shuffling. (If you are unable to do this, remember the bottom card of your deck and trade decks with him before starting.)</p>
<p class="p-indent">We will assume that the card on the bottom of his deck, the one you glimpsed, is the 3H. Instruct the spectator to remove any card from his deck and place it on top of his deck. You pretend to do the same with your pack. Actually you look for the 3H and place it on top of your deck.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Tell him to place his deck behind his back, cut the deck and complete the cut. You place your deck behind your back and pretend to do the same thing. Actually you do nothing. The 3H is still on top of your deck.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Exchange decks with the spectator. Then have him look through the pack given to him and find his chosen card. You look through the deck he gave you and pretend to look for your card. Actually you look for the Three of Hearts. When you find it, cut it to the top of the pack.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Now remove the top card of your deck and place it face-down on the table. Place the deck to the left of it. Instruct the spectator to place his chosen card face-down on the table and his deck to the left of it. Say to him, “It’s easy for me to learn the name of your card. All I have to do is look at the top card of my deck.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Turn up the top card of your deck. Then turn over his chosen card and show that both have matched, as in <a class="ref_int" href="e9780486156569_c04.html#int_17" id="ref_int_17">Figure 17</a>.</p>
<p class="p-indent">“Of course you can learn the name of my card by following the same procedure,” the magician adds.</p>
<div class="illustype_image_text_net"><div class="caption"><p class="p"><a class="label_int" href="e9780486156569_c04.html#ref_int_17" id="int_17"><span class="i">Figure 17</span></a></p></div>
<div class="image_text_net"><img alt="e9780486156569_i0018.jpg" src="images/e9780486156569_i0018.jpg"/></div></div>
<p class="p-indent">The top card of the spectator’s deck is turned face-up. Then the magician’s chosen card is turned face-up, and both cards are found to be identical!</p>
<p class="p-indent">Other variations of this classic trick include developments where the bottom card of the spectator’s deck is found to match the bottom card of the magician’s deck. However, it has been the author’s experience that the double climax described above is strong enough to make it one of the most outstanding card effects you will perform.</p></div></div>
