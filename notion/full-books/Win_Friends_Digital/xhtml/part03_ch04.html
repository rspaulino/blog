<p class="paraspaceabove"><span class="AvenirLTStd-Heavy"><strong><span class="big">“S</span></strong></span>uccessful leaders . . . are always initiators,” writes leadership expert John C. Maxwell in his flagship book <em>The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership</em>. He then recalls an instance where beginning in a friendly way was not only necessary but highly recommended. Still a young man, he had been hired to take over the leadership of a troubled church in Lancaster, Ohio, where he was told a large and intimidating man named Jim Butz, the elected lay leader of the congregation, was the most influential person in the organization. He was also told Jim had a reputation for maverick behavior that at times had led the church down the wrong path.</p>
<p class="indent">The first thing Maxwell did was arrange a meeting with Jim in his office. It could have been an awkward or even grossly misperceived moment—a twenty-five-year-old rookie summoning the sixty-five-year-old patriarch to meet with him—but Maxwell dispelled that notion immediately. The second Jim sat down, Maxwell began with a humble acknowledgment of the situation. Jim was the influencer in the church, and Maxwell wanted to work with him, not against him. Maxwell then suggested they meet once a week for lunch to talk through the <a id="page_126"/>issues and make decisions together. “While I’m the leader here,” said Maxwell, “I’ll never take any decision to the people without first discussing it with you. I really want to work with you. . . . We can do a lot of great thing together at this church, but the decision is yours.”</p>
<p class="indent">When he finished, Maxwell explains, “Jim didn’t say a word. He got up from his seat, walked into the hall, and stopped to take a drink at the water fountain. I followed him out and waited. After a long time, he stood up straight and turned around. . . . I could see that tears were rolling down his cheeks. And then he gave me a great big bear hug and said, ‘You can count on me to be on your side.’”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch04en1"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch04en1a">1</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">Friendliness begets friendliness. We are more inclined to agree with another person or see things from his perspective when we have friendly feelings toward him. If, in contrast, we feel a person is busy or brusque or uninterested in sharing a common courtesy, we tend to mirror the sentiment. This is a difficult obstacle to overcome whether you’ve just met the person or have known him awhile.</p>
<p class="indent">Where the initiation of interactions is concerned, no approach sets the tone more effectively than gentleness and affability, even if the other person is a source of pain, frustration, or anger. A friendly greeting says: “You are worth my time. You are valuable.” This subtle message has tremendous power—more than most realize.</p>
<p class="indent">In <em>The Seven Arts of Change,</em> author David Shaner shares an incredible experience that taught him the immense power of beginning in a friendly way.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch04en2"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch04en2a">2</a></span> He had been recruited by a longtime friend to teach Ki-Aikido at the Aspen-Snowmass Academy of Martial Arts, just up the road from Pitkin County, a Colorado locale made famous in 1970 when American journalist Hunter S. Thompson ran for sheriff on the “Freak Ticket,” promoting <a id="page_127"/>the decriminalization of drugs for personal use, turning asphalt streets into grassy meadows, banning buildings that obscured the mountain view, and renaming Aspen “Fat City” to deter investors. Thompson narrowly lost the election that year, but his sentiment set the stage for another, less controversial, but equally unconventional man to become sheriff. His name was Dick Kienast, whose campaign poster had cited Sissela Bok’s vision of societal values: “Trust is a social good to be protected just as much as the air we breathe or the water we drink.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch04en3"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch04en3a">3</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">Kienast believed civility and compassion should rule all law enforcement interaction whether it involved violent felons or frustrated traffic offenders. “It was a momentous change initiative,” writes Shaner, “and one that many thought foolish and unnecessary. . . . Nevertheless, he moved forward in confidence.” Among Shaner’s first Ki-Aikido students at Aspen-Snowmass Academy were Sheriff Kienast and his deputies. Bob Braudis was one of Kienast’s key deputies and would go on to succeed him as Pitkin County sheriff. Before then Deputy Braudis would establish his legacy with a compelling display of beginning in a friendly way.</p>
<p class="indent">Braudis was an imposing presence and fit the stereotype of a brawny, no-nonsense cop. This presence served as a stark and effective contrast to his demeanor with people. He never raised his voice, even in the midst of volatile situations. One event serves as a case in point.</p>
<p class="indent">While Deputy Braudis was the patrol director, a dispatch came through that an armed man was holding all the patrons hostage at a local restaurant called the Woody Creek Tavern. Braudis was the first to arrive on the scene, and from outside the building he was apprised of the situation. The man’s estranged wife was prohibiting him from visiting his daughter, whom he had seen in the restaurant. Rather than attempting a peaceful <a id="page_128"/>greeting, something clicked inside the man. He yanked out a gun and forced everyone inside to comply with his wishes.</p>
<p class="indent">Deputy Braudis assessed the danger and took a different tack. He peacefully approached the window unarmed. Sensing the deputy’s affability, the gunman allowed him to enter the building. Braudis then proceeded to address the man in a civil manner, asking him to consider the consequences of his actions, which could ultimately lead to him never seeing his daughter again.</p>
<p class="indent">“Bob’s placid demeanor, his rational discussion of the real issues, and his empathy toward the man’s rage validated the suspect,” writes Shaner. “And the more the man talked with Bob, the more he realized that much of his anger was with himself. He eventually put down his weapon. The man’s whole demeanor then changed. . . . Bob explained that exiting the tavern with cuffs on would put all the law enforcement people outside the tavern at ease so that neither Bob nor the suspect would run the risk of being shot. The man complied, and the conflict was ended peacefully.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch04en4"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch04en4a">4</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">Consider this story the next time you sit down to write an email to somebody who has made you frustrated or angry. Will you begin with a civil, courteous tone or let your emotions take over and jump into conflict? Will you take a few moments to inquire about the other person’s life or work situation or to create a bond through some shared interest by telling them something about yourself? If you begin in a friendly manner, you are far more likely to get the positive results you seek, especially if you and the other person are currently at odds.</p>
<p class="indent">“I do not like that man,” Abraham Lincoln once said. “I must get to know him better.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch04en5"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch04en5a">5</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">If you believe building a friendly rapport will be critical to achieving a certain outcome, using texts, chats, or other short <a id="page_129"/>forms of communication isn’t likely to get you very far. Because of the limited space and the lack of intonation and nonverbal cues to support your sentiment, it’s very difficult to create the level of communication necessary to convey affability. If face-to-face is not possible, at least use a medium that will allow time and space to convey a level of friendliness that in Carnegie’s time ruled human relations. It takes creativity and a bit more time to replicate the effect of a warm smile and a firm handshake, but it can be done.</p>
<p class="indent">“Social media requires that business leaders start thinking like small-town shop owners,” concurs entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk, who wrote <em>The Thank You Economy</em>.</p>
<p class="blockquote1">This means taking the long view and avoiding short-term benchmarks to gauge progress. . . . In short, business leaders are going to have to relearn the ethics and skills our great-grandparents’ generation used in building their own businesses and took for granted. . . . [O]nly the companies that can figure out how to mind their manners in a very old-fashioned way—and do it authentically—are going to have a prayer of competing.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch04en6"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch04en6a">6</a></span></p>
<p class="indent1">There was an age when people left their houses in their best attire and said hello to all they passed on the way to work, when a meeting meant meeting and when a call meant paying someone a visit rather than using the phone. While our transactions span the globe today, making such tangible connection more infrequent, it is still key to treat others in the same spirit you would if they were before you. Of his growing wine empire, Vaynerchuk explains, “We talk to every single individual as though we’re going to be sitting next to that person at his or her mother’s house that night for dinner.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch04en7"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch04en7a">7</a></span> It’s the proper perspective <a id="page_130"/>because it places the burden of accountability squarely where it should be—on the messenger’s shoulders.</p>
<p class="indent">The mistake many make today is placing the burden of accountability on the recipient of the message. We use the responses and reactions of others as the only gauge of whether we have taken the right approach or made the right impression. This is a slippery slope on two fronts.</p>
<p class="indent">First, it can lead to laziness in considering motive’s role in effective connection. If garnering a great response is the only measure of connection, then we easily become mere entertainers, provocateurs, and product pimps who think only about the next great gimmick to grab people’s interest. Shock value is worth little where true connection is concerned.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, responses can be deceptive, especially in the beginning. A tweet may garner many retweets, but this does not mean that those relaying your message to others have become fans or even friends. They may be thinking of someone else who might benefit from the message or might want to consider the product; worse, they may have in mind someone who would laugh alongside the retweeter at your lack of knowledge, sincerity, or tact. An online marketing campaign might generate a spike in site traffic or a print media campaign lots of journalistic buzz, but wise businesspeople know this does not mean relationships are being formed.</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference between engagement and interest. Interest is piqued in a number of ways, many of which are less than genial. It often begins and ends on a superficial level because the primary emotions tapped are curiosity, surprise, or disgust.</p>
<p class="indent">Engagement occurs on a deeper level when a person’s core values are tapped. Common to all core values is the notion of being considered worthy of relationship. When you engage <a id="page_131"/>another in a friendly manner, you convey to him he is someone worthy of friendship, someone whom you’d like to call friend. It is for this reason “he who sows courtesy reaps friendship.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch04en8"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch04en8a">8</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">If you want your voice to reach through the noise and beneath the surface to others’ motives for moving in your direction, begin in a friendly way. The first impression that makes is far more memorable than anything the loudest or most provocative attention-grabber on the planet could come up with.</p>
<p class="indent">Years ago, when Carnegie was a barefoot boy walking through the woods to a country school in northwest Missouri, he read a fable about the sun and the wind. It serves as a vivid reminder of the power of this principle of earning others’ trust.</p>
<p class="indent">The sun and wind debated about which was the stronger, and the wind said, “I’ll prove I am. See the old man down there with a coat? I bet I can get his coat off him quicker than you can.”</p>
<p class="indent">So the sun went behind a cloud, and the wind blew until it was almost a tornado, but the harder it blew, the tighter the old man clutched his coat to him.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally the wind calmed down and gave up, and then the sun came out from behind the clouds and smiled kindly on the old man. Presently, the man mopped his brow and pulled off his coat. The sun then reminded the wind that gentleness and friendliness were always stronger than fury and force.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s a timely lesson in an age that appears to divvy rewards based on greatest volume, speed, and splash. Such rewards mean little in the long run because engagement that engenders longevity is continually authenticated on mutual benefit and trust. If you don’t establish a foundation for both from the beginning through a friendly sentiment, both become more difficult to secure with each passing day. Wait too long or take too many shallow shots at attention and you’ll be left trying to <a id="page_132"/>talk the other into a relationship. It’s never the place you want to be—begging for commitment.</p>
<p class="indent">“Engagement has to be heartfelt,” writes Vaynerchuk, “or it won’t work. . . . You cannot underestimate people’s ability to spot a soulless, bureaucratic tactic a million miles away. It’s a big reason why so many companies that have dipped a toe in social media waters have failed miserably.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch04en9"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch04en9a">9</a></span></p>
