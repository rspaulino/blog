<p class="paraspaceabove"><span class="AvenirLTStd-Heavy"><strong><span class="big">“H</span></strong></span>e called himself Mike,” began blogger and consummate Building Champions business coach Steve Scanlon as he relayed a story he loves to share. “My wife, Raffa, and I were staying a few blocks south of Central Park, and we’d hailed his cab to embark on an annual dining tradition in Little Italy. Our timing was terrible. It was Halloween, and the already crowded streets were twice full. As Mike chopped his way through midtown and lower Manhattan it was apparent our plans would need to change. He suggested Greenwich Village, and we agreed. A few minutes later he dropped us at a Village curb, recommended three restaurants, and then rolled back into the crawling mass. I thought it was the last we’d seen of him.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch06en1"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch06en1a">1</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">But, as Scanlon likes to say with a smile, Mike thought differently.</p>
<p class="indent">As they enjoyed their meal, Scanlon reached for the front pocket of his pants. He patted here and there, and there and here. His phone was missing. He panicked as he suddenly remembered where it was.</p>
<p class="indent">Resignation set in as he imagined the misery of canceling his account, losing valuable contact information, and buying a new <a id="page_88"/>phone. He dialed his number from his wife’s phone, expecting to hear his own recording. Instead, a gentle Indian accent answered.</p>
<p class="indent">“Hulloo?”</p>
<p class="indent">“Who’s this?” Scanlon snapped, brusquer than intended.</p>
<p class="indent">“Thees is Mike,” the voice said.</p>
<p class="indent">Scanlon took a breath and fumbled through an explanation that ended with them needing to catch a flight home very soon.</p>
<p class="indent">“My goodness,” Mike replied, “your phone is very important. I will come as quickly as I can.” He then coordinated a street corner meeting and promised to hurry.</p>
<p class="indent">Scanlon turned to his wife in amazement and relief and explained what was happening. When Mike pulled to the curb twenty minutes later and delivered the phone, Scanlon put $80 in the cabbie’s hand—all the cash on him.</p>
<p class="indent">“He was humbled,” explained Scanlon, “but I wanted him to know how outstanding the act was. He hadn’t mentioned money once. Turning off his meter and going way out of his way to help an irresponsible customer was extraordinary—I’d have given him twice the cash if I had it on me.”</p>
<p class="indent">This cabbie’s small act of service made a big impact; it turned a nightmare into noteworthy experience. Scanlon calls what Mike did “small-picture thinking.” It is the foundation of leaving others a little better.</p>
<p class="indent">Somewhere along the way, we were taught to keep the big picture at the forefront of our minds. We learned the benefits of setting big goals, making big connections and closing big deals. Today, the most common big picture may be gaining a big following. And while such big pictures have value, if our minds are focused only on big payoffs, we will overlook the small opportunities that make the biggest difference. We will miss chances to go a little deeper, to connect a little tighter, to make others feel that much better about their relationship with us.</p>
<p class="indent">“The point,” explained Scanlon, “is not that big-picture <a id="page_89"/>thinking is bad. It is a necessary piece of progress—especially with people—but it alone is not enough to reach your big goals.”</p>
<p class="indent">Many steps come between what we sow and what we reap. Most are small seeds planted in the small moments of every day.</p>
<p class="indent">Consider the sales manager at Macy’s who cast a big vision to double women’s shoe sales in June. There would be a big summer sale, he explained, and in combination with a big push in upselling, that would turn out big results. What resulted, unfortunately, was no big deal.</p>
<p class="indent">June 1 came, and his sales force stopped listening to the customers’ stories. They stopped being sensitive to customers’ budgets and considerate of their time. Instead they began fishing for big opportunities to suggest a more expensive shoe or a half-priced second pair or a matching accessory. By month’s end, total sales had decreased by 8 percent.</p>
<p class="indent">What went wrong?</p>
<p class="indent">A typical sales manager might blame his sales team for lack of execution. This particular manager pointed the finger at himself. What could he have done differently? He realized his big-picture obsession had taken his team’s focus off the small actions that would make it a reality. It is a common mistake. Fortunately, this particular manager had a second chance.</p>
<p class="indent">A few months later, Macy’s was having a Labor Day sale. The sales manager took a different approach. He painted the same big picture—double the previous month’s sales—but this time he described the small details within the big picture. He asked his people to look for every opportunity to serve their customers: walk them to the bathroom, hold their babies, park their strollers behind the counter, be mindful of their time commitments and budget constraints. Instead of focusing on what they were selling, the sales team should focus on making their customers’ days a little better, whether or not they bought shoes.</p>
<p class="indent">What do you think happened?</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_90"/>Total sales for September were 40 percent higher than August. It was not a doubling of sales—a goal even the manager admitted was quite lofty—but it was 50 percent better than the same effort in June. Most important, it was progress. The difference was in the details.</p>
<p class="indent">The big picture didn’t change. The salespeople’s focus did. Instead of looking for the big sell, they sought small, meaningful ways to leave people a little better. The smaller seeds sown meaningfully reaped a bigger harvest.</p>
<p class="indent">Many people make the mistake of equating inspiration with implementation. They are like an art teacher who sets his students down in an alpine meadow and asks them to reproduce the glorious landscape. The big picture is inspiring: long swaying grass, white aspens with shimmering golden leaves, a brook winding toward the backdrop of snowcapped mountains. But merely seeing the picture does not equip the students to skillfully depict one blade of grass on the canvas. Without instruction in painting each small detail in that big picture, their efforts will look nothing like that picturesque meadow before them. To become great artists who can replicate the big picture, the students must learn to focus on the small particulars. Nowhere in life is this truer than in human relations.</p>
<p class="indent">Who doesn’t have grand plans for certain partnerships, collaborative efforts, or friendships? A marriage proposal is nothing if not a vision for the future of the relationship. A collaboration agreement is nothing if not a vision for the future of the business partnership. An employment agreement is nothing more than a vision of the great work an employer and employee can accomplish together. But is it enough to wax poetic about your love for the woman? Is it enough to promise great customer service, relevant content, or valuable support?</p>
<p class="indent">It is said that Leonardo da Vinci began painting <em>Mona Lisa</em> in <a id="page_91"/>1503 and did not finish until 1519. Some art historians speculate he spent much of that span considering and crafting the enigmatic smile that has been the centerpiece of conversation for five centuries. The famous smile now adorns its own $7.5 million room in the Louvre, where 6 million visitors pay their respects each year. The painting’s value is estimated in the ballpark of half a billion U.S. dollars, though most claim she is priceless.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch06en2"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch06en2a">2</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">What would <em>Mona Lisa</em> be without its most famous detail? A big picture that never realized its potential.</p>
<p class="indent">In the same respect, your biggest and best intentions—for a relationship, for your followership, for a company or collaborative endeavor—will regularly fall short of their potential if your inspirational intentions do not translate into small acts of service and value.</p>
<p class="indent">“Most business people treat customer service like an ad campaign,” said Scanlon. “They post it, promise it, and promote it. But unless they produce it in small increments every day, customer service is only lip service.” It is <em>Mona Lisa</em> without the smile—a nice effort but not that different from anything, or anyone, else.</p>
<p class="indent">What you must always remember is that what motivates you to win friends is rarely what motivates others to grant you friendship.</p>
<p class="indent">You are motivated by what can be achieved with others’ loyalty or support or collaborative effort. You are motivated by the big picture of connection and collaboration—by how things can be.</p>
<p class="indent">In contrast, those with whom you want to connect and collaborate see only the small pictures of their own experience with you. They see the true measure of your motives in bytes and feats. They are motivated by how things are.</p>
<p class="indent">Others are constantly asking of you: “How valuable is my relationship with this person?”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_92"/>“What have you done for me lately?” still guides the mind of the masses, perhaps more so today amid the backdrop of millions of messages and messengers vying for attention. This does not suggest, as some believe, that you must continually outdo yourself or that you must parade as a spectacle. It simply means that the secret to all interpersonal progress is adding value, and doing so with regularity.</p>
<p class="indent">Unfortunately, “in the digital age winning friends has come to be about marketing, about standing out, about being significant,” said legendary peak performance coach Tony Robbins in a recent interview. “There are two ways to be significant,” he explained, “do something really well or do something really poorly. Unfortunately, infamy is the easiest way to get known today. Technology gives us the incredible power to connect with, learn from, and add value to any person on the planet 24/7, and yet we can burn someone or be foolish and get significance instantly. It is unfortunate many people choose that path.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch06en3"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch06en3a">3</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">Besides the obvious relational consequences of this tack, the strategic problem is that there is no shortage of provocative items being broadcast in the digital age. Between media outlets, marketing campaigns. and me-first digital manners, your competition on the stage of sustaining interest is colossal. And the rewards are famously shallow.</p>
<p class="indent">The real key to winning friends and influencing people today, says Robbins, is “moving relationships from manipulative to meaningful. The only way you do that is by constantly adding meaning and value.”</p>
<p class="indent">This is the scale on which every one of your interactions is judged—every tweet, post, email, call, and tangible encounter. To which side does your scale tip in each encounter—toward more value or less value? To which side does your scale tip over time? That is perhaps the more important question, because <a id="page_93"/>we all make mistakes. We have bad days. Still, the fallout of interpersonal failures can be swifter and more merciless than it has ever been before. For that reason alone, it is wisest to do everything within your power—through every medium and every message—to leave others a little better. While we certainly have some room for error, it’s more of a laundry room than a grand ballroom. How many times has a mere glance put a relationship on the fritz?</p>
<p class="indent">Various traditions tell of gods and goddesses of justice. Themis, a Titan, was an organizer of communal affairs. Dike was the Greek goddess of justice, who weighed right and wrong. Justitia was the Roman personification of justice, forced to ascend to the heavens because of the wrongdoing of mortals. Ma’at was the Egyptian goddess who held the universe in order until the moment of creation and then became a heavenly regulator.</p>
<p class="indent">Out of these gods and goddesses arose a modern personification of Justice, the blindfolded, sword-holding, scale-bearing image associated with Western judicial systems. Her message couldn’t be simpler: truth must be weighed on a case-by-case basis for truth to prevail.</p>
<p class="indent">A subtler message is this: anything can tip the scales. There isn’t an idle argument or irrelevant fact in a case. The scales of justice measure it all.</p>
<p class="indent">What’s true in justice holds true in human relationships. There are no neutral exchanges. You leave someone either a little better or a little worse.</p>
<p class="indent">Jordan was assessing his divorce a decade after it occurred, on the eve of his second wedding. A friend asked why his first one failed. It was, he said, because he neglected the scales. Every single interaction with his spouse sent her one of two messages—that she was the most important person in the world to him or that she wasn’t. He’d sent the latter message far too often.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_94"/>It is unrealistic to expect every exchange with every person to be life-altering. But your scale still tips one way or another every day. Knowing this should give you plenty of reasons to pay attention to every message you send. Placing this high a priority on altruism would set you apart in this digital age.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>New York Times</em> columnist David Brooks wrote a column called “High-Five Nation” in which he contrasted the humility on display after Japan’s surrender at the end of World War II with what we see on display today. “On the day of victory, fascism had stood for grandiosity, pomposity, boasting and zeal. The allied propaganda mills had also produced their fair share of polemical excess. By 1945, everybody was sick of that. There was a mass hunger for a public style that was understated, self-abnegating, modest and spare.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch06en4"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch06en4a">4</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">Humility, and the sense that others should occupy our minds as much as if not more than we do, was part of the culture of that era. Over time the sentiment began to change, writes Brooks. “Instead of being humble before God and history, moral salvation could be found through intimate contact with oneself . . . self-exposure and self-love became ways to win shares in the competition for attention.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch06en5"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch06en5a">5</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">Certainly some people have gained attention today—perhaps “notoriety” is a better word—by worshipping themselves and creating a culture of celebrity around themselves. Some make millions off this strategy. But what is our impression of such people? Do they influence others for good? Perhaps after all the attention, they point people to a cultural good, which is better than nothing. But such people serve primarily as provocateurs. Like wine before a bland meal, they prepare our palate for nothing substantial.</p>
<p class="indent">There is one thing that hasn’t changed over the millennia—something philosophers from every culture have concluded. It <a id="page_95"/>is as old as history itself. Zoroaster taught it to his followers in Persia 2,500 years ago. Confucius preached it in China 2,400 years ago. Lao-tse taught it to his disciples in the Valley of the Han. Buddha preached it on the bank of the holy Ganges around the same time. The sacred books of Hinduism taught it 1,000 years before that. They all concluded: Don’t do to others what you wouldn’t want them to do to you. Two thousand years ago Jesus put a slightly different spin on it: “Do to others what you would have them do to you.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch06en6"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch06en6a">6</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">It is the only rule in human history we call golden.</p>
<p class="indent">An ironic advantage of our digital age is that many people hold a notion of superiority, which affords you a simple way to make a lasting impression: show them in some subtle way they are right. They are far more likely to return the favor.</p>
<p class="indent">“You know why I like you, Ike?” Winston Churchill asked President Dwight Eisenhower, who had labored, more or less harmoniously, alongside the strong personalities of Bernard Law Montgomery, Charles de Gaulle, and Franklin D. Roosevelt. “Because you ain’t no glory hopper.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch06en7"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch06en7a">7</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">Always leave people a little better, and you might be surprised how big it makes you and how far it takes you.<a id="page_96"/></p>
