<p class="paraspaceabove"><span class="big"><strong>W</strong></span>e already discussed the debacle surrounding Armando Galarraga’s almost-perfect game, destroyed by a gross umpire error on what should have been the final play. When you look at the replay you see that Galarraga’s face slips from elation to disbelief in seconds. The cheers of the crowd are interrupted by an eerie silence. Then loud boos and profanity ensue.</p>
<p class="indent">Galarraga was needlessly robbed of what is considered the holy grail of pitching accomplishments. This is all the more maddening when you consider that the pitcher was not a superstar expected to reach such heights. He was an average journeyman who had accumulated an equal amount of wins and losses. This was perhaps his one shot at pitching prominence, and it had been spoiled. Who would blame him for lashing out at the umpire—crying out for justice? Even Joyce himself, after the game, said that if he were the pitcher, he would have been fast and fierce in the umpire’s face. But there is yet another side—a third dimension—to the story.</p>
<p class="indent">More memorable than Galarraga’s tainted perfection or Jim Joyce’s subsequent contrition was the pitcher’s response to the pilfering of his prize. His handling of the injustice engaged the entire world.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_148"/>In an ESPN interview following the game Galarraga admitted he did not know what the call was going to be. He was just concentrating on catching the ball and getting the out. He admitted he was disappointed but conceded that the runner might have been safe. He was both nervous and excited. The intensity of the situation meant that he had to rely on the calm judgment of the umpire.</p>
<p class="indent">After the game, however, Galarraga viewed the replay and knew that a perfect game had just been taken from him. Yet somehow, when he spoke to the umpire he was able to say, “I know nobody is perfect.” He saw Joyce’s contrition and knew he had a choice: beat him down further or see things from his perspective. The consideration compelled Galarraga to offer a hug to Joyce to make him feel okay. This was no camera-ready compassion. Galarraga was sincerely disappointed <em>and</em> sincerely empathetic. Throughout the postgame interview he consistently responded to questions and the situation with the utmost nobility. He did not attempt to paint the umpire as a villain. He displayed humility and perspective, the progenitors of empathy.</p>
<p class="indent">In an age bent on self-promotion and interpersonal leverage, we seldom take the time to consider how someone else might feel in any given situation.</p>
<p class="indent">No one in the sports world would have faulted Galarraga for ripping the umpire on national television. Who would have whispered a word if the pitcher had used a featured interview as a platform to demolish Joyce’s reputation?</p>
<p class="indent">Yet Galarraga did nothing of the sort. His comments centered on how the umpire must have felt or what he must be feeling and the acknowledgment that nobody is perfect. We marvel at this kind of reaction because it is so uncommon. Yet an intriguing and noteworthy point is that the young pitcher cemented a more memorable place in sports history for his response to losing the <a id="page_149"/>perfect game than he would have if he had achieved pitching perfection.</p>
<p class="indent">Those who can find a way to engage others in a manner worthy of such distinction are on the path of significant influence. When dealing with a person, always ask yourself, “How would I feel, how would I react, if I were in his shoes?”</p>
<p class="indent">“Cooperativeness in conversation,” wrote Gerald S. Nirenberg, “is achieved when you show that you consider the other person’s ideas and feelings as important as your own.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch07en1"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch07en1a">1</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">We frequently hear critiques of the world’s leaders. It is easy, as the saying goes, to sit in the stands and solve everyone else’s problems. What we rarely witness are people who say, “I can’t imagine the pressure you must be under to have the weight of an entire country on your shoulders. I can’t imagine how much you must lie awake at night thinking through whether you made the right decision or said the right thing on national television.”</p>
<p class="indent">Once you take the time to consider the other person’s perspective, you will become sympathetic to his feelings and ideas. You will be able to authentically and honestly say, “I don’t blame you for feeling as you do. If I were in your position, I would feel just as you do.” This phrase, so rare in discourse today, will stop people in their tracks, will immediately get their attention, and will make them far more amenable to your ideas. Most people are merely looking for somebody who will listen to them and be sympathetic with their plight, regardless of how large or small their woes. If you can do that for another, you are giving her a gift that will brighten her day, even her week or month.</p>
<p class="indent">One man took a Dale Carnegie course years ago and reported how the special, genuine interest of a nurse profoundly impacted his life. Martin Ginsberg grew up poor, without a father and with a mother on welfare. One Thanksgiving day he waited alone <a id="page_150"/>in the hospital for orthopedic surgery. His mother had to work and couldn’t be there for him; loneliness was crushing him. He pulled the covers and pillow over his head and wept.</p>
<p class="indent">Just then a young student nurse poked her head in, heard him sobbing, sat on his bed, pulled the covers and pillow off him, and wiped away his tears. She told him how lonely <em>she</em> was too. She had to work all day and couldn’t be with her family. Then she asked young Martin whether he would have dinner with her.</p>
<p class="indent">He agreed.</p>
<p class="indent">So she went to the cafeteria and returned with two trays of Thanksgiving dinner. They talked and talked, and while she was supposed to get off work at 4:00 p.m., she stayed until 11:00 p.m., when he fell asleep.</p>
<p class="indent">“Many Thanksgivings have come and gone since then,” Ginsberg writes, “but not one ever passes without me remembering that particular one and my feelings of frustration, fear, loneliness, and the warmth and tenderness of a stranger that somehow made it all bearable.”</p>
<p class="indent">Today there’s little excuse for misunderstanding or overlooking another’s perspective. Most of us are broadcasting the details of our lives, seeking significance or a sympathetic ear from anyone who will listen. By taking time to research other people’s current circumstances you will avoid making assumptions about them. If a person is important to you in some way, every second you spend trying to better understand his perspective is a second well spent.</p>
<p class="indent">We are not empathetic creatures naturally, so we must work at it. Many elements can factor in to how we respond in certain situations: our upbringing, our faith persuasion, our economic status, or our current career status. These and more mix with our emotions to produce a mode of personal engagement with others. Yet when we take the very things that personally move us and <a id="page_151"/>allow them to paint our perceptions of others, we move to a more influential place where our words can have significant impact.</p>
<p class="indent">We would all grow in stature and confidence if we could learn how to celebrate the most common thread in everyone. Imagine the personal barriers you could bridge in your workplace, your home, or your friendships if you could always respond to mistakes and disputes in a gracious manner. What sort of treatment would you receive back? What sort of perception would others have of you?</p>
<p class="indent">Remember, empathy is not a networking tactic to be learned and leveraged; it is a link to immediate affluence in human relations. It is Galarraga giving up his right to berate Jim Joyce and burning his name into the heart of every sports fan the world over. This is the undeniable power of a gracious, understanding approach.<a id="page_152"/></p>
