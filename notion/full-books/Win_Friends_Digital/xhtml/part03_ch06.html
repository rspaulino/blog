<p class="paraspaceabove"><span class="big"><strong>A</strong></span> Dale Carnegie Training student in Australia relayed the following story, which serves as a good lesson for what can happen when we ignore this principle.</p>
<p class="blockquote1">My business partner and I operated one of the largest IT retailers in Brisbane. We had eight stores, employed more than sixty staff members, and had a turnover of more than $10m per year. Although my business partner had helped me a lot and he was a reasonably easygoing person, I believed all the success was contributed by me. There was only one way to run the company and it was my way. When there was a likelihood of an argument, I made sure it became an argument and tried to win it regardless of the cost. I never began our meetings in friendly fashion and often talked down to him. I never considered his feelings and even wondered why he wasn’t more like me.</p>
<p class="blockquote2">In the end I won all the arguments and had my way, but I lost the partnership and subsequently the company. After I learned this principle I started looking back and now understand how wrong I was. I often think if I had known these things sooner, how different my business would be today. I <a id="page_142"/>know I can’t change the past now, but I can see the mistakes I made and try to not repeat them.</p>
<p class="indent1">Today this gentleman is a different person. “Now I always ask my partners about their goals before I set my own,” he writes. “Then I ask myself, ‘What can I do to help this relationship lead to their goals?’”</p>
<p class="indent">While it’s easy to see why we want credit for successes for which we labored, claiming the credit will never win you friends. It will also diminish your influence quicker than just about any other action.</p>
<p class="indent">What is the worst quality in a leader? Ask the followers and they would tell you it is the quality of taking credit when things go well and dishing out blame when things go wrong. Few postures send a clearer “It’s all about me” message. Few messages send people scurrying in the other direction faster.</p>
<p class="indent">Who wants a friend who thinks it’s all about them? Who wants a leader who doesn’t see your contributions? The answers to those questions are easy.</p>
<p class="indent">Answering the opposite questions is just as easy: Who wants a friend who doesn’t care who gets the credit? Who wants a leader who sees the full value of your contribution?</p>
<p class="indent">“Giving away credit is a magical multiplier,” writes <em>Forbes</em> blogger August Turak, a former founding employee at MTV.</p>
<p class="blockquote1">It works equally well in business and in our personal lives. But harnessing this magic requires an attitude of gratitude. Without a sincere sense of gratitude, sharing credit is just another manipulative trick bound to backfire. . . . None of this is rocket science. It’s common sense. So why is credit stolen far more often than shared? The usual suspect is fear.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch06en1"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch06en1a">1</a></span></p>
<p class="indent1"><a id="page_143"/>But fear, in this case, should be reserved for the possibility of becoming a person who is afraid to share the spoils of success.</p>
<p class="indent">Turak shares a homily he once heard that makes this point well:</p>
<p class="blockquote1">“The Sea of Galilee is teeming with fish and life,” the priest began. “The Dead Sea is dead and devoid of life. They are both fed by the sparkling water of the River Jordan, so what’s the difference? The Sea of Galilee gives all its water away. The Dead Sea keeps it all for itself. Like the Dead Sea, when we keep all that is fresh and good for ourselves, we turn our lives into a briny soup of salty tears.”</p>
<p class="indent1">Surrendering the credit for a job or project can’t be a false humility, a covert approach to seeking the spotlight. This is a form of the martyr syndrome. The principle suggested here is born not of attention-seeking activity but rather of a supreme confidence that you are a far better person when those around you know they play an important role not only in a collaborative success but also in your personal success.</p>
<p class="indent">Watch any film or music awards show and you will see this dynamic in action, especially in the more magnanimous participants. What is the first gesture expected of the winner of an award? An acceptance speech. And what are acceptance speeches but a list of thank-yous to those who were responsible for the winner’s success? Some would argue this is merely standard show script, but those faces behind the names would have something else to say.</p>
<p class="indent">As the camera swings to show these faces, all are beaming—some even crying joyful tears, sharing in the success, and reciprocating the gratitude.</p>
<p class="indent">It is perhaps no coincidence that Greer Garson, the woman <a id="page_144"/>credited with the longest acceptance speech in Oscar history at five and a half minutes, is also the co–record holder with Bette Davis for the most consecutive Best Actress Oscar nominations at five. Could it be that all that gratitude was a big part of the reason she was so successful?</p>
<p class="indent">It’s often said that to be successful you must surround yourself with successful people. While there is truth to the statement, few see that there are two ways to approach this positioning. Either you can seek friendships with those who are already successful, or you can seek success for those who are already friends. Whichever way you choose, one thing is certain: your success is always commensurate with the number of people who want to see you successful. But one way provides better numbers.</p>
<p class="indent">When you seek friendships with those who are successful, there is no guarantee they will want success for you too. You might have to work to overcome being perceived as a relational leech. On the other hand, when you seek success for those who are already friends, you can just about guarantee that these same people will want success for you.</p>
<p class="indent">Surrendering the credit is a way of life you cultivate in your relationships because you are grateful for them and for what they give to you. It is nothing more than putting the success and betterment of others first—and putting your confidence in both who you are and in the rubberlike power of reciprocity.</p>
<p class="indent">Mark Twain certainly possessed the former; and Henry Irving could not accuse him of at least trying to put confidence in the latter. There’s an amusing anecdote about a conversation between the two literary contemporaries that neatly demonstrates this principle.</p>
<p class="indent">Henry Irving was telling Mark Twain a story. “You haven’t heard this, have you?” he inquired after the preamble. Twain assured him he had not. A little later Irving again paused and <a id="page_145"/>asked the same question. Twain made the same answer. Irving then got almost to the climax of the tale before breaking off again: “Are you quite sure you haven’t heard this?”</p>
<p class="indent">The third time was too much for the listener.</p>
<p class="indent">“I can lie twice for courtesy’s sake, but I draw the line there. I can’t lie the third time at any price. I not only heard the story, I invented it.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch06en2"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch06en2a">2</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">Twain would have been happy to let the awkward irony pass without a word of the actual truth. Did it really matter to him that it was his story all along? No. He was happy to have the story play well for the good of the conversation. While Twain gave in at the end—and who could blame him?—the funny story illustrates that it doesn’t matter who gets the credit for a thing so long as that thing benefits all the parties involved.</p>
<p class="indent">Inherent in the principle of surrendering the credit to someone else is this word we’ve already used: “reciprocity.” We don’t give in order to get in a transactional sense. But we do give in order to foster relationships—and by doing so we know there will be rewards. Reciprocity is a natural by-product of a relationship where two people share in joys and pains. “Double the joy, half the sorrow,” goes the saying. In true relationships friends look for ways to repay friends. What would happen if this spirit of relating spread throughout a company or a particular niche in the marketplace, or even across an entire value chain?</p>
<p class="indent">Two things are certain: (1) everyone involved would enjoy life a lot more, and (2) success would be more probable as collaboration occurred naturally. We have more power to spread this spirit of relating today than ever.</p>
<p class="indent">In the long run, no one but the originator remembers things such as whose idea it was, who spoke first, or who took the first risk. What people remember is magnanimity. It is an interesting paradox that the more you surrender the credit for something <a id="page_146"/>you’ve done, the more memorable you become, and the more you actually end up receiving credit.</p>
<p class="indent">President Ronald Reagan was once quoted as saying, “What I would really like to do is to go down in history as the president who made Americans believe in themselves again.” From this quote alone we can establish a fairly accurate character analysis of the man. He was in the game so that others could win. His political goals centered on the uplifting and success of those he served in the office of president.</p>
<p class="indent">Perhaps what best typifies Reagan is the quote on the plaque that sat above his Oval Office desk. It read: “There is no limit to what a man can do, or where he can go, if he doesn’t mind who gets the credit.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch06en3"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch06en3a">3</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">So often this is the case for influential people. They pursue a higher calling, something that transcends whatever political, bureaucratic, or success-oriented motivations stifle others. Reagan dismissed comments about his legacy with the quip that he wouldn’t be around to hear what the scholars and historians would say of him. This is what endeared him to so many as a person and leader. He lived and led with a constant surrender to the greater good of a country and did so with starkly unconventional methods. This is the mark of a person who seeks to elevate others despite himself. It is the unconventional mind that understands success isn’t about attention and accolades. It’s about partnerships and progress.</p>
