<p class="paraspaceabove"><span class="big"><strong>I</strong></span>n their book <em>The Preacher and the Presidents,</em> coauthors Nancy Gibbs and Michael Duffy detail the Reverend Billy Graham’s path of unlikely ascendance and unmatched influence with not only seven U.S. presidents but also nearly every other global leader in the Western world. This path, they point out, was not without its resistance, especially early on. How Graham dealt with one of his staunchest opponents provides a preview of the first principle necessary for winning others’ trust.</p>
<p class="indent">“In February 1954,” they write, “Graham’s patron Henry Luce wrote to <em>TIME</em>’s man in London, the legendary correspondent Andre Laguerre, to prepare him for what was about to come when Graham landed in London for a spring crusade.” This was a time when church membership was much lower in Britain (between 5 and 15 percent of the population) than it was in the United States (59 percent). “ ‘Religion in Britain is near death,’ Luce noted, ‘so Billy’s impact will be worth watching. . . . Surely he will be scorned by all the people you know.’”</p>
<p class="indent">One of those scorners, explain Gibbs and Duffy, was a columnist from the <em>Daily Mirror,</em> “a man named William Connor, who called Graham ‘Hollywood’s version of John the Baptist.’ As <a id="page_100"/>he often did with prominent critics, Graham suggested they meet in person; Connor mischievously suggested a rendezvous at a pub called the Baptist’s Head.”</p>
<p class="indent">As it turned out, neither Luce, Laguerre, nor Connor could estimate the effect Graham would have on the city. “So many people came the first week that from then on he held three meetings at Harringay Stadium on Saturdays. . . . Night after night eleven thousand people sat and another thousand stood, in rain or sleet or cold, to hear him preach.” His audience included members of Parliament, an admiral, and the navy chief of staff. Nor could the journalists estimate the effect Graham would have on them personally—especially William Connor. After meeting the preacher for a chat at the irreverently named pub, Connor the critic became Connor the admirer.</p>
<p class="indent">“I never thought,” he confessed of Graham in a subsequent column, “that friendliness had such a sharp cutting edge. I never thought that simplicity could cudgel us sinners so damned hard. We live and learn.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch01en1"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch01en1a">1</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">While Graham could have employed a front of passive aggression by ignoring the cheeky jabs, or fought the jabs with press-worthy indignation, he chose a higher road, a far more effective path. He avoided an argument altogether and won his critic over with grace and goodwill.</p>
<p class="indent">Arguing with another person will rarely get you anywhere; they usually end with each person more firmly convinced of his rightness. You may be right, dead right, but arguing is just as futile as if you were dead wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">Humorist Dave Barry made this point quite well when he said: “I argue very well. Ask any of my remaining friends. I can win an argument on any topic, against any opponent. People know this, and steer clear of me at parties. Often, as a sign of their great respect, they don’t even invite me.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_101"/>So much of our time online is spent arguing or feeding arguments. Look no further than comments at the bottom of popular blogs and news sites. It’s nearly always a string of he said/she said or attempts at one-upmanship. Beyond that, the recent and ongoing corporate and political banter seems to primarily involve proving points and stating cases instead of finding common ground on which to build something of mutual value. Few of these arguments change people’s minds. Because the arguments are digitally veiled and lack the clear-cut consequences of tangible confrontations, both parties can get away with devolving into snarky personal attacks and passive ambiguity—the least effective tools of human relations.</p>
<p class="indent">Such was the case when former BP chief executive Tony Hayward took a hard line of personal self-exoneration and arrogant apathy in reaction to the tragic <em>Deepwater Horizon</em> explosion and subsequent oil spill that took eleven human lives, ravaged the Gulf states ecosystem, and devastated the livelihood of thousands more workers around the country.</p>
<p class="indent">According to an article in <em>The Times,</em> he started by refuting scientific findings about the nature and amount of the spill. Then his contention that the spill was “tiny” compared to the size of the ocean and that the environmental impact of America’s biggest oil spill, and of the 950,000 gallons of toxic dispersant that have been used to treat it, would be “very, very modest” set off a series of gaffes from which he could not recover, including a backhanded apology to the people of Louisiana in which he stated, “I would like my life back.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch01en2"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch01en2a">2</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">When, two days after dodging questions and ditching blame before U.S. lawmakers, he was found in Cowes on the southern coast of England for a yacht race in which his boat, <em>Bob,</em> was entered, it merely highlighted what had already been established: whether or not he was right, Hayward had lost both his credibility <a id="page_102"/>and his case in the court of public opinion. When influence and impact are at stake, it is often the only court that matters.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch01en3"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch01en3a">3</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">After his line of argument, few could trust the man. He seemed to care about two things and two things only: himself and his empire. Under his argumentative approach, BP quickly went from suspect to reject, regardless of what story the facts would turn out to tell. Wherever BP was sold to consumers, boycotting began. Why fill up at a BP station when there were a dozen others belonging to companies that didn’t have fearlessly uncaring leaders trying to argue their way to exoneration?</p>
<p class="indent">Some of the chain of reaction was based on perception, of course, but reality remains perception when the facts aren’t clear. And when the case is in the realm of human relations, perception is often so strong that even irrefutable facts are not enough to supplant the wave of bad press that preceded them.</p>
<p class="indent">In Hayward’s defense, after his dismissal from BP—a day he called one of the saddest of his life—he was far more empathetic not only about his company’s role in the spill but also about his approach to the tragedy. Friends laud Hayward as a kind and generous family man, and there is no doubt they have good reason. Furthermore, BP has been a solid, respectable company for decades. Both deserve to be valued for their finest moments, no less than any of us would had our argumentative approach with a spouse, colleague, or client been widely publicized. And both Hayward and BP still likely will. But why not avoid the valleys in the first place?</p>
<p class="indent">We will face conflict nearly every day of our lives. So how do we prevent a tactful discussion from becoming an aggressive argument? In the end you must value interdependence higher than independence and understand that deferential negotiation is more effective in the long run than a noncompliant crusade.</p>
<p class="indent">One South American leader has proven this principle’s merit <a id="page_103"/>despite great historical and personal odds. For a man who came from poverty, who led a labor union in a country not known for workers’ rights, who watched his wife die when she was eight months pregnant because they couldn’t afford adequate health care, and who formed his own political party, one might expect a fighter. But Luiz Inácio Lula de Silva, called Lula by all, defied expectations at every turn.</p>
<p class="indent">“My mother always said two people can’t fight if one person doesn’t want to,” Lula told a reporter once. And so Lula doesn’t fight, an approach that helped him become the president of Brazil and hold the position for almost ten years. When his newly formed socialist party lost elections year after year, he developed an alliance with a right-wing party and courted business leaders despite his social goals. When he became president on the promise to prioritize the impoverished in Brazil, he also built alliances with Brazil’s wealthy and vast upper class by focusing on growing the economy.</p>
<p class="indent">“I consider myself a negotiator. If we want peace and democracy, we have to be tolerant, to negotiate more,” he has said.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch01en4"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch01en4a">4</a></span> Lula’s tolerance and negotiation helped him achieve astounding things during his time in office. Through building alliances both domestically and internationally, he enacted social programs that pulled more than twenty million people out of poverty and into the middle class, while also creating a period of strong economic growth and stability. In a country known for the vast divide between the rich and the poor, Lula’s people skills put Brazil on course to reverse historical inequalities.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch01en5"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch01en5a">5</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">The notion of communication has been greatly misinterpreted, explains corporate behavioral specialist Esther Jeles. “We have come to believe it is all about the delivery. In doing so, we regularly forfeit the full potential [of] our exchanges.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch01en6"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch01en6a">6</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">Jeles reminds the executives and employees of corporate <a id="page_104"/>clients such as Twentieth Century Fox, Leo Burnett, and Harpo, Inc., that there is an important reason all personal growth techniques spring from the act of listening to your inner wisdom. Inside us all is “a vault of better self-understanding, higher knowledge and greater ideas,” she explains. “Tension and conflict occur when you—and/or those with you—discard the notion that others also have inner wisdom that ought to be heard.”</p>
<p class="indent">How, then, do we build a practice of avoiding arguments? See the singular advantage of operating interdependently.</p>
<p class="indent">This occurs, says Jeles, when you “acknowledge that greater interpersonal results are always more probable when your experience and insight are compounded with that of others.”</p>
<p class="indent">No matter how expressive or persuasive you might be, this does not occur by one person trumping another. It occurs when the end result of the tension is a mutual stretching of insight and personal growth. And if you can see your interactions clearly despite tension and conflict, there is little you can’t accomplish in collaboration with others.</p>
<p class="indent">“All of us know how to get attention,” asserts Jeles, “but few of us know how to get attention and respect at the same time.” Set yourself apart by being one who avoids the arguments that most jump into with both feet.</p>
