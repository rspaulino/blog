<p class="paraspaceabove"><span class="big"><strong>P</strong></span>eddling ice to Inuits? Selling seawater to a dolphin? Compelling consumers to wear cotton? Today the last of those doesn’t seem like a stretch. Examine the threads of every clothing item you own and chances are high many if not most of them are cotton. But in the 1970s that was probably not the case. Polyester and its synthetic cousins were the rage. They didn’t wrinkle, they resisted stains, and they were formfitting—and as a result, cotton’s market share dwindled to about 33 percent.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch09en1"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch09en1a">1</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">The industry decided to fight back. It needed to make cotton desirable again, so it did what any industry would do: it started a trade association, hired ad firms, and rebranded cotton.</p>
<p class="indent">The slogan they settled on to save their industry? “Cotton: The fabric of our lives.”</p>
<p class="indent">They had celebrities pitch the slogan. Barbara Walters famously donned a Hawaiian shirt, looked into the camera, and said, “Cotton . . . it’s making my life comfortable today.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch09en2"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch09en2a">2</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">When the cotton industry was on the line, its members made the strategic decision that the best way to get people to buy their threads was by threading cotton into a personal story. Cotton wasn’t a soft, white, fluffy fiber that was spun into threads that became fabric that became garments; cotton gave life meaning by <a id="page_162"/>tying it together into a beautiful story. Today cotton commands about two-thirds of the market.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch09en3"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch09en3a">3</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">People don’t want to be treated as commodities, but more than that, they don’t want to see their lives as ordinary. People want to know that they matter, and the best way to show them that they do is by allowing them to connect with a larger story. People and businesses that understand this principle are unbeatable.</p>
<p class="indent">In 2011, Apple topped <em>Fortune’</em>s survey of business people as the world’s most admired company for the fourth year in a row.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch09en4"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch09en4a">4</a></span> Part of the company’s secret is found in one of the most famous TV ads in history.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1984, during the Super Bowl, Apple unveiled its Macintosh personal computer for the first time. The ad was aimed at distinguishing the radically new and creativity-encouraging Mac from the conformity of the masses (to Apple, that was IBM).</p>
<p class="indent">In the ad an athletic young woman carrying a large hammer runs into a room of look-alike, dress-alike pseudo-people. She throws the hammer at a great screen and destroys an Orwellian Big Brother–type figure. It is the dawning of a new day. Treating people as mere Social Security numbers with arms and legs is over. One-on-one business was the wave of the future.</p>
<p class="indent">The proof of this concept isn’t found just in Apple’s success; it is also found in some simple shoes.</p>
<p class="indent">Blake Mycoskie started TOMS shoes after a story disrupted his life. He was traveling in the developing world when he noticed a simple problem: the kids he saw had no shoes. No shoes meant a lot of other nos in their stories . . . a lot of deprivation. So Blake decided to start a company that would match every pair of shoes purchased with a pair of new shoes for a child in need.</p>
<p class="indent">The first year he had the pleasure of giving away ten thousand shoes. Today that number is over one million. But that’s not <a id="page_163"/>where the story ends. One afternoon in an airport waiting area Mycoskie noticed a girl wearing a red pair of his shoes. Without revealing his identity, he asked about them. The girl told him the whole story behind TOMS in such detail that it rivaled his own description of the company. It was a moment that made him realize, “The truth is, what’s inside this box is not nearly as important as what it represents. TOMS is no longer a shoe company; it’s a one-for-one company.”</p>
<p class="indent">“In addition to attracting the interest of mainstream media starting with <em>Vogue, Time</em> and <em>People</em> magazine, TOMS Shoes attracted prestigious partners,” explains power blogger Valeria Maltoni. “Ralph Lauren, who had not partnered with anyone for 40 years, joined in with TOMS Shoes for the rugby brand. The ad agency working with AT&amp;T created a commercial to tell the ‘authentic story’ of how Blake used their network to stay in touch and work on the go.”</p>
<p class="indent">Maltoni concludes her thoughts on the success of TOMS with an insightful nod to the power of this principle: “People remember. And when a message is a mission, they will tell your story to anyone who will hear it—even a stranger at an airport. And by doing that, they become your strongest advocates in marketing your product. . . . The lesson: influence is given.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch09en5"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch09en5a">5</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">While larger stories can be inviting, the land of small, personal stories can be intimidating. It is one thing to reveal a cause, cure, or commodity. It is another thing entirely to reveal yourself.</p>
<p class="indent">In April 2003, author David Kuo was driving home from a party with his wife. He woke up in the ER, told he had a brain tumor likely to kill him in a matter of months.</p>
<p class="indent">At three o’clock on that Palm Sunday morning, David and his wife, Kim, faced a decision: How much of their story did they want people to know? How willing were they to share it?</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_164"/>The tendency was to remain private. But they resisted that impulse, and Kim started calling friends, telling them the story and telling them to tell others so that they could pray. Within hours a page for them was set up on CaringBridge.org, a nonprofit site where people facing serious illness can post updates, needs, and anything else that they would like.</p>
<p class="indent">In the weeks and months that followed, the Kuos decided that the more information they could share, the more people they could help—they knew they were hardly alone in their cancer battle. That decision was life-changing for them. They saw their story as part of something far larger than them. It eventually provided a type of opportunity for them with other people facing similar challenges.</p>
<p class="indent">Their first bit of advice for everyone? Share your story.</p>
<p class="indent">That’s something Ann M. Baker from Seattle, Washington, learned in a Dale Carnegie Training course:</p>
<p class="blockquote1">Most people treasure their privacy, as I do. However, when faced with breast cancer, chemotherapy, and radiation treatments, I did not want to share the worry and the pain.<br/>But when my cancer news slipped out among family, friends, and coworkers, I was overwhelmed with email encouragement. Even family acquaintances whom I had never met emailed their breast cancer stories, including phone numbers and follow-on get-well cards.</p>
<p class="blockquote2">This amazing outpouring of courage and love started a recovery journey that has changed my life. . . . And thanks to email, I know that no one needs or wants to journey the cancer road alone. For life is not about me. It is about us.</p>
<p class="indent1">There’s nothing wrong if something that is “about us” is also “good for me.” One digital media blogger with more than <a id="page_165"/>a million followers put out the word that she was going to have Lasik surgery to correct her eyesight. Not only was she going to have the surgery, she was going to stream it live on her blog for all who were interested in having the surgery themselves. Transparency became her currency. She not only got 20/15 vision, she got better insight into a whole new way of using the digital world to share our personal journeys with others. She cites the live stream of a friend’s recent wedding or a client’s use of live streaming video to watch his son’s football games when he’s away on business as good examples.</p>
<p class="indent">“Aside from sports, entertainment and marketing, what else can live video be used for?” she asks. “Will it be adopted as a new communication channel used for functional benefit? . . . What about weddings, graduations, club meetings, religious ceremonies, birthdays, coaching, instructional content, cooking classes, births or even funerals? The opportunities are endless if they are embraced.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch09en6"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch09en6a">6</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">People trudge through most days with little excitement in their lives. But our digital age provides so many opportunities to give people an authentic view of who you are or what your company strives to be, thus creating touch points of commonality that draw you into closer friendship with others. It is easy to make a video instead of presenting a few drawings. It is easy to create a dynamic website to support a new company or organization. It is easy to use video conferencing instead of a call and to show a compelling presentation to all involved instead of simply telling them. But people have come to expect these things, too.</p>
<p class="indent">To really make your idea pop, take a unique approach. Step beyond the bounds of your computer and do something people don’t see every day. Use all of the tools available to you and your imagination to make your ideas vivid, interesting, and dramatic. <a id="page_166"/>Share your stories, and others will be willing to share theirs. Together you will create a new and larger story.</p>
<p class="indent">More and more common—and commonly effective at building influential relationships—is the authentic intersection of personal and professional life. While this intersection will always have certain judicious boundaries, many of the historically businesslike boundaries have been lowered or removed altogether today because most people have come to remember that the short- and long-term success of all interactions—transactional or otherwise—rides on the depth of the relationship. The more a colleague, friend, or customer shares of your journey, the more you can accomplish together.</p>
<p class="indent">When your journey is our journey, we are both compelled to see where it goes.</p>
