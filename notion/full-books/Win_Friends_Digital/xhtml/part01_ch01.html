<p class="paraspaceabove"><span class="big"><strong>A</strong></span>sk both Adolf Hitler and Martin Luther King Jr. for a basic definition of influence and you might get similar answers. Observe their biographical application of influence and you will discover their definitions couldn’t be more at odds. The tangible distinction begins with their words.</p>
<p class="indent">Pit “How fortunate for leaders that men do not think” against “I am not interested in power for power’s sake but . . . in power that is moral, that is right and that is good,” and the divergence is obvious.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part01_ch01en1"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part01_ch01en1a">1</a></span> The former maintains influence is the reward of the cunning, condescending cynic. The latter maintains influence is the reward of the trustworthy agent of the common good. Every day our words place us somewhere between the two disparate approaches. History details the results at either end. We communicate toward tearing others down or toward building others up.</p>
<p class="indent">To this end, Carnegie was succinct in his advice: don’t criticize, condemn, or complain. But how much more difficult this seems today. To say we must be more mindful of our words is an understatement. With an immense digital canvas on which to communicate our thoughts comes an equally immense canvas <a id="page_4"/>of accountability called public access. “Digital communications have made it possible to reach more people in faster and cheaper ways,” explained bestselling <em>Enchantment</em> author Guy Kawasaki in a recent interview, “but a loser is still a loser. You could make the case that technology has made it possible to blow one’s reputation faster and easier than ever.”</p>
<p class="indent">It is a good case indeed, and precisely today’s counterpoint of applying this principle.</p>
<p class="indent">What was once a covert criticism can now get you fined. Ask Dr. Patrick Michael Nesbitt, a former Canadian family practice physician who was fined $40,000 for posting “vicious” and defamatory remarks on Facebook about the mother of his daughter.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part01_ch01en2"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part01_ch01en2a">2</a></span> Or Ryan Babel, the Dutch striker of the Liverpool Football Club, who following a loss to Manchester United tweeted a link to a doctored picture of referee Howard Webb with the comment “And they call him one of the best referees. That’s a joke.” He was subsequently fined £10,000, about $16,000.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part01_ch01en3"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part01_ch01en3a">3</a></span> Of Babel’s tweet, BBC blogger Ben Dirs noted, “Whereas a year ago Babel might have let off steam to his girlfriend, now he has this very convenient—and very tempting—tool at his fingertips that allows him to sound off to the world.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part01_ch01en4"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part01_ch01en4a">4</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">What was once a careless complaint among friends can now get you fired. A 2009 study by Proofpoint revealed that of U.S. companies with a thousand or more employees, 8 percent reported removing someone for their comments on sites such as Facebook and LinkedIn.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part01_ch01en5"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part01_ch01en5a">5</a></span> Getting more specific, a recent online issue of the <em>Huffington Post</em> describes thirteen Facebook posts that got people dismissed from their jobs.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part01_ch01en6"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part01_ch01en6a">6</a></span> Included in the list are:</p>
<p class="bulletlist">• A waitress at a pizza restaurant who posted her complaint and profane criticism of two customers after receiving a small tip for waiting on their table for three hours, which <a id="page_5"/>included staying an hour past her shift. “Thanks for eating at Brixx,” she snarked, and then went on to deride the customers, calling them “cheap.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part01_ch01en7"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part01_ch01en7a">7</a></span></p>
<p class="bulletlist">• A game-day employee at the Philadelphia Eagles stadium who posted a derogatory status update in which he condemned the team for allowing beloved safety Brian Dawkins to sign with the Denver Broncos. “Dan is [expletive] devastated about Dawkins signing with Denver . . . Dam Eagles R Retarted!!”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part01_ch01en8"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part01_ch01en8a">8</a></span></p>
<p class="bulletlist">• Seven employees of a Canadian grocery store chain called Farm Boy who created the Facebook group “I got Farm Boy’d” that mocked customers and included “verbal attacks against customers and staff.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part01_ch01en9"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part01_ch01en9a">9</a></span></p>
<p class="indent1">At times one can wonder whether criticism has become more prevalent than compassion and judgment more prevalent than grace in our communication media. There is no disputing that snark is chic. With so many opportunities to be heard, many seem keen on thrusting forth their right to speak when someone else is wrong, yet they just as quickly shrink into their right to remain silent when it is they who are wrong. Many are accustomed to holding a sword called the First Amendment in one hand and a shield called the Fifth in the other—all the while forgetting that to do so is to deem human relations a battlefield. In many ways this culture of criticism and complaint is the unfortunate reality.</p>
<p class="indent">Yet the influential person understands that such indiscretions quicken the path to relational breakdown no matter how right you are or how wrong the other remains. Such tactics tear down far more often than they build up because they suggest an underlying, unilateral motive whether or not it exists. They subsequently move an interaction from tame to tense. It is no <a id="page_6"/>wonder we have more talking heads than true leaders today. Influence is always at stake, but many want nothing more than to state their case. Not only does it set a poor precedent, it does nothing but fuel the tension and increase the gap between a message and meaningful collaboration.</p>
<p class="indent">However, when a true leader shows up, there is no disputing the converse effect. There have been few more compelling communicators than the deliverer of the Emancipation Proclamation. President Lincoln was long known as a man who approached tense situations with poise and grace. His reaction to a significant tactical error during a climactic moment of the Civil War is case in point.</p>
<p class="indent">The Battle of Gettysburg was fought during the first three days of July 1863. During the night of July 4, General Robert E. Lee began to retreat southward while storm clouds deluged the country with rain. When Lee reached the Potomac with his defeated army, he found a swollen, impassable river in front of him and a victorious Union Army behind him. Lee was trapped. Here was the Union Army’s golden opportunity to capture Lee’s army and end the war immediately. With a surge of confidence, Lincoln ordered General George Meade not to call a council of war but to attack Lee immediately. The president telegraphed his orders and then sent a special messenger to Meade demanding immediate action.</p>
<p class="indent">Meade called a council of war. He hesitated. He procrastinated. He telegraphed all manner of excuses to the president. Finally the Potomac receded and Lee crossed the river and escaped with his forces.</p>
<p class="indent">Lincoln was furious. “What does this mean?” he cried to his son Robert. “Great God! What does this mean? We had them within our grasp and had only to stretch forth our hands and they were ours; yet nothing that I could say or do could make the <a id="page_7"/>army move. Under the circumstances almost any general could have defeated Lee. If I had gone up there I could have whipped him myself.”</p>
<p class="indent">In bitter disappointment, a normally restrained Lincoln sat down and wrote Meade what was, given his history, a harsh letter.</p>
<p class="blockquote1"><em>My dear General,</em></p>
<p class="blockquote2"><em>I do not believe you appreciate the magnitude of the misfortune involved in Lee’s escape. He was within our easy grasp, and to have closed upon him would, in connection with our other late successes, have ended the war. As it is, the war will be prolonged indefinitely. If you could not safely attack Lee last Monday, how can you possibly do so south of the river, when you can take with you very few—no more than two-thirds of the force you then had in hand? It would be unreasonable to expect and I do not expect that you can now affect much. Your golden opportunity is gone, and I am distressed immeasurably because of it.</em></p>
<p class="indent1">It was a letter quite justified in being sent. Yet Lincoln never sent it. It was found among his papers after his death.</p>
<p class="indent">What do you suppose kept the president from venting his great disappointment and understandable criticism?</p>
<p class="indent">President Lincoln was a master communicator, and humility was at the heart of all he said. He must have considered that if he sent the letter, it would have relieved some of his frustration but simultaneously ignited resentment in General Meade, further impairing the man’s usefulness as a commander. Lincoln knew Meade had just been assigned to be commander of the Army of the Potomac only days before. He also knew Meade enjoyed a string of heroic successes. Certainly Meade was under a great <a id="page_8"/>deal of pressure, with the added burden of bad blood between him and some of those he was being asked to command. Had Lincoln brushed such details aside and sent his letter, he certainly would have won the battle of words, but he would have suffered loss in the war of influence.</p>
<p class="indent">This does not mean General Meade did not deserve to be informed of his error. It does mean there was an ineffective way to inform him and an effective way. Lincoln did eventually convey to Meade his disappointment, but he did so in a dignifying manner. In choosing to graciously withhold the more cutting letter, Lincoln chose to retain and even increase his influence with Meade, who would go on to be a force for civic good in his hometown of Philadelphia until his death in 1872.</p>
<p class="indent">Lincoln seemed to know, perhaps more than any other American president in history, when to hold his tongue and when silence was a graver mistake than speaking up. At the core of this skill was an understanding of one of the most foundational truths of human nature. We are self-preserving creatures who are instinctively compelled to defend, deflect, and deny all threats to our well-being, not the least of which are threats to our pride.</p>
<p class="indent">Consider the steroids scandal in Major League Baseball. Of the list of 129 players linked to steroid and human growth hormone use via positive tests, the Mitchell Report, or implications by colleagues, only sixteen admitted use.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part01_ch01en10"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part01_ch01en10a">10</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">Merely high-profile athletes with high-profile egos?</p>
<p class="indent">Not so fast. Consider the last time a colleague came down on you for something you said or did. Are we to suppose his words made you want to give the guy a hug and buy him lunch? Or did you want to hide an open can of sardines in his desk? And that’s probably being nice.</p>
<p class="indent">Neither you nor I enjoy being the subject of disapproval, whether or not it is deserved. “As much as we thirst for approval,” <a id="page_9"/>explained endocrinologist Hans Selye, “we dread condemnation.”</p>
<p class="indent">When we attempt to use criticism to win an argument, to make a point, or to incite change, we are taking two steps backward. People can be led to change as horses can be led to water, but deprecation will rarely inspire the results you are aiming for. We are not merely speaking of public discourse. This is just as true in private conversation.</p>
<p class="indent">Despite a zeitgeist of denigrating commentary in blogs, talk shows, and social media, the moment you use a medium to criticize, the subject of your criticism is compelled to defend. And when another is defensive, there is little you can say to break through the barriers he has raised. Everything you say is then filtered through skepticism, or worse, complete incredulity. In this way critical comments act like invisible boomerangs. They return on the thrower’s head.</p>
<p class="indent">This occurs all the more quickly in a world where nearly everything we communicate is a keystroke, mike, or phone cam away from international exposure. Actor Mel Gibson learned an unfortunate lesson when the profane, racially charged condemnation he left on his ex-girlfriend’s voicemail was broadcast to the world. His global influence, once a significant force out of Hollywood, took a huge hit.</p>
<p class="indent">A less volatile yet still damaging example occurred in July 2008, when a Fox News microphone picked up comments that, according to a CNN blog post, “the Reverend Jesse Jackson meant to deliver privately that seemed to disparage the presumptive Democratic nominee for appearing to lecture the black community on morality.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part01_ch01en11"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part01_ch01en11a">11</a></span> Despite Jackson’s instant public apology, his comments put a dent in his national influence on matters important to members of the black community. Furthermore, they placed into question his support of the Illinois senator Barack Obama, who would soon become the forty-fourth U.S. president.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_10"/>While most of us will avoid such widely publicized communication gaffes, before we rest in judgment of public figures who have stumbled, we would do ourselves well to consider what others might say should our worst private outburst become public. Better still to always follow a simple principle in our dealings with others—don’t criticize, condemn, or complain. We live in an age where the world can hear our words, where global accountability is a very real possibility, where our communication catastrophes can follow us indefinitely.</p>
<p class="indent">Despite a global trend toward loose talk, it is neither wise nor necessary to criticize others to make your messages more effective, more important, or more newsworthy. The degree to which you can be heard today is best thought of not as a burden or blessing but as a responsibility. Those who accept this responsibility with humility, compassion, and a trustworthy zeal are much quicker to rise because others remain willing to listen. The people most widely respected within industries, companies, families, and groups of friends are those who are clear in their own viewpoints while remaining compassionate with those whose minds or behavior they would like to influence.</p>
<p class="indent">Change by force of words is called coercion in some scenarios. There is a reason it is a crime. And while it might not be illegal between two coworkers, colleagues, or friends, we’d do just as well to avoid any sentiment of it.</p>
<p class="indent">The simplest way is to focus on improving yourself instead of others.</p>
<p class="indent"/>
<p class="bulletlist">• Shift your use of media from a spirit of exposé and objection to a spirit of encouragement and exhortation. There is nothing wrong with informing your friends and fans, even about the things they might want to avoid, but the spirit of your information is key. Are you sharing information <a id="page_11"/>because you have an ax to grind? This sort of communication is better reserved for the safety of a trusted colleague’s couch. Even if people are already on your side, bragging and whining don’t bring them closer. If anything, such behavior makes them question whether they can trust you with their own mistakes and musings.</p>
<p class="bulletlist">• Resist badmouthing as a differentiation strategy. Its long-term effect is far more harmful than helpful. In a global economy, you never know when your greatest competitor will become your greatest collaborator. What will you do when the best road to business growth goes through someone with whom you have already burned the relational bridge? Competition is healthy and should be respected. Collaboration is critical and should be protected.</p>
<p class="bulletlist">• Make your messages meaningful by removing your agenda. Whether you are tweeting big news to a large fan base or updating a handful of board members, it’s wise to remember that no one wants a barrage of what’s important to you. Above all, the recipients of every bit and byte of your communication want value. If all you do is fill their ears, inboxes, and iPhones with descriptions of your latest problem or biggest gripe, they won’t listen for long. There is enough positive communication available to let another’s downbeat dogma fill our minds.</p>
<p class="bulletlist">• Calm yourself before communicating to another. When you are put off, the first five minutes are usually the most volatile. If you can train yourself to stuff the knee-jerk response, you will save yourself hours of backpedaling, back-scratching, and brownnosing down the road. While we all have our moments of indiscretion, there is little worse than a private indiscretion gone public. Save yourself the small trouble—and potentially extensive dilemma—by <a id="page_12"/>taking a step back before spouting something you might come to regret.</p>
<p class="indent1">While there is always something to say in appraisal of another, it is good to remember that there is always something to be said in appraisal of you, too. The ancient Jewish proverb provides appropriate wisdom here: “For in the way you judge, you will be judged; and by your standard of measure, it will be measured to you.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part01_ch01en12"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part01_ch01en12a">12</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">And while it is difficult at times to downplay our right to speak freely, a quick scan through history will remind you that the greatest influencers are those who held their tongue and swallowed their pride when the tide of negative emotion was arising, and instead let brevity, humility, and wisdom say far more than a critical tirade ever could.</p>
<p class="indent">Perhaps there is no more memorable example than the prolific British writer G. K. Chesterton’s reply to an invitation by the <em>Times</em> to write an essay on the subject “What’s Wrong with the World?”</p>
<p class="indent">Chesterton’s response:</p>
<p class="blockquote1"><em>Dear Sirs,</em></p>
<p class="blockquote2"><em>I am.</em><br/><em>Sincerely,<br/>G. K. Chesterton</em><span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part01_ch01en13"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part01_ch01en13a">13</a></span></p>
<p class="indent1">It is no surprise that a 1943 <em>Time</em> review of his book <em>Orthodoxy</em> reported that the robust writer’s most popular antagonist, Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw, called him “a man of colossal genius.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part01_ch01en14"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part01_ch01en14a">14</a></span> The same review referred to Shaw as the “friendly enemy” of his contemporary. Even Chesterton himself described the uniquely spirited relationship between the two as that of <a id="page_13"/>“cowboys in a silent movie that was never released.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part01_ch01en15"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part01_ch01en15a">15</a></span> The men were at odds on most every issue of their day, yet the spirit of their relationship never was, thanks in large part to Chesterton’s ability to keep his ego in check and respect the opinions of a man who couldn’t have disagreed with him more. The result was not uncommon in the writer’s life.</p>
<p class="indent">Chesterton’s influence reached well beyond, perpetually engaging the minds of contemporaries such as Bernard Shaw, Oscar Wilde, and H. G. Wells. His book <em>The Everlasting Man</em> contributed to the Christian conversion of C. S. Lewis, then an atheist; his biography of Charles Dickens was largely responsible for creating a popular revival and serious scholarly reconsideration of Dickens’s work; his novel <em>The Man Who Was Thursday</em> inspired the Irish Republican leader Michael Collins with the idea “If you didn’t seem to be hiding nobody hunted you out”; and his column in the <em>Illustrated London News</em> on September 18, 1909, had a profound effect on Mahatma Gandhi.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part01_ch01en16"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part01_ch01en16a">16</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">To win friends and influence others in today’s world takes less than clever rhetoric. It takes the understated eloquence of grace and self-deprecation. If I am the problem with the world, and you are too, then we can stop worrying about who is right and get on with the work of making our world better. Bury your boomerangs and your words will forge a much quicker path to progress.<a id="page_14"/></p>
