<p class="paraspaceabove"><span class="big"><strong>I</strong></span>n his classic book <em>Leadership Is an Art,</em> author Max DePree famously asserted, “The first responsibility of a leader is to define reality. The last is to say thank you. In between, the leader is a servant.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part04_ch01en1"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part04_ch01en1a">1</a></span> A tendency is to take the assertion to mean we must bear down and get the ugly stuff said first, as though it were to the leader’s advantage to get the bad news out of the way. But this is not the case, especially in a day and age when bad news travels at the speed of light.</p>
<p class="indent">While a current relationship, whether between a company and its customers or between two individuals, might be strained or even in serious trouble, it does little good to start off a conversation on a negative note. Like a play whose first act features a tragedy, it sets a gloomy and unpleasant stage. Shoulders sag, faces fall, and hearts begin to sink inside the recipients. Imagine this effect spread viruslike throughout the ranks of an organization or across a company’s entire value chain or across an entire country. You will be forced to work against a wave of negative psychological and physiological reactions from the start, and even if you can overcome them quickly, there’s no need to spend the little time you may have trying to undo something that could have been avoided in the first place.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_176"/>Instead, begin a conversation with honest and genuine appreciation; the receiver will be more amenable to your ideas and less defensive or resistant.</p>
<p class="indent">Many of us have experienced that defensiveness and resistance when dealing with customer service agents—amazingly enough! But Sanjiv Ekbote, who had recently read <em>How to Win Friends and Influence People,</em> knew how to handle a difficult situation.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part04_ch01en2"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part04_ch01en2a">2</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">He had recently purchased a house with a home warranty. One evening the bathroom faucet began to leak, so he called the warranty company. And within four hours, a young technician arrived to fix the problem. First he replaced the valve, but the water began flowing faster. So the technician capped the pipe, but the water pressure broke seals and water began leaking inside the walls.</p>
<p class="indent">Sanjiv was upset and immediately called the warranty company to ask them to send a more experienced technician. He could have ranted and raved at the person who answered the phone, but instead he paused. He calmly provided his information, and then he thanked the representative for sending out a technician so quickly. He explained what had happened, and the woman tracked down an expert technician, scheduled the earliest appointment possible, and waived the service fee.</p>
<p class="indent">If Sanjiv had reacted differently, would he have received the same service?</p>
<p class="indent">This seems like a rather simple technique, yet it is deceptively difficult to practice. Let’s consider DePree’s mandate for leaders to understand why. At the heart of our misinterpretation of his statement is the connotation that the term “reality” carries in our daily discourse. Why is it that we have to “face reality,” deliver “a dose of reality” that is reluctantly swallowed like foul medicine, bring someone “back to reality” from an idyllic dreamland that doesn’t jibe with the hard-nosed facts? This is the mind-set from which we often approach crucial conversations.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_177"/>Is reality actually a bitter pill, or at least an overly pragmatic one? Probably not, but we may be hardwired to see it that way, particularly when something is nagging at us. Our hunter-gatherer ancestry still dictates that we pay particular attention to the most dramatic unfolding around us, and usually these are negative ones. Our survival depends on this ability—or it once did, anyway. Neuroscientists, in a variety of studies, have shown that “we care more about the threat of bad things than we do about the prospect of good things. Our negative brain tripwires are far more sensitive than our positive triggers,” wrote Ray Williams, a leadership coach.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part04_ch01en3"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part04_ch01en3a">3</a></span> We even remember negative events better, or at least our memories are skewed toward them.</p>
<p class="indent">Unfortunately, research has shown that this effect isn’t limited to events but extends to the impressions we form of other people. We may weigh those traits or behaviors we deem to be negative more heavily than the positive, particularly if they are moral or ethical in nature.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part04_ch01en4"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part04_ch01en4a">4</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">At those times when we hope most strongly to encourage change in others, we are often frustrated with current conduct. Our brains are preoccupied with the negative behavior. It shapes our perception of reality. It crowds out the positive. And so it is no surprise that in our communications we can’t seem to help jumping into the problem—or, from our listeners’ perspectives, the criticism.</p>
<p class="indent">Our listeners’ brains are just like ours. The negative or critical in what we say becomes their point of obsession. It drowns out all possibility of discovering the positive opportunities within the conversation. I’m sure you’ve seen it happen: faces grow tight, expressions become studiously blank, and only the eyes may reveal the inner rant of protest that is blocking out anything else you might have to say.</p>
<p class="indent">If we don’t work hard to avoid this drama, we shoot ourselves <a id="page_178"/>in the leadership foot. In a classic study on how negative and positive feedback affect performance, J. Sidney Shrauger and Saul Rosenberg discovered, quite simply, that our performance suffers when we receive feedback that we have failed in some way.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part04_ch01en5"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part04_ch01en5a">5</a></span> Now, if we are confident and have strong self-esteem, the effect is less severe. However, a secondary reaction to criticism is to discount the validity of the feedback—we reject it outright, so it has little effect on our behavior except to sully our attitude.</p>
<p class="indent">Why take the risk? Why not mitigate these effects on performance or attitude right from the start?</p>
<p class="indent">In an article on leadership skills for teachers, Trent Lorcher explained how, as a basketball coach, he had handled a disappointing loss with his team. “We lost an important game on account of several missed free throws. My natural reaction was to yell at my team. Instead, I praised them for being aggressive and getting to the free throw line consistently. We then practiced free throws for the next hour. My players, already upset by the loss, responded well to praise.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part04_ch01en6"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part04_ch01en6a">6</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">In his latest book, <em>Good Boss, Bad Boss,</em> Robert Sutton, an organizational psychologist, relates a story sent to him by a former U.S. Army officer. Most of the man’s superior officers were jerks—nasty, belittling, and mean-spirited. But his battalion commander was different.</p>
<p class="blockquote1">I got out of a line a few times and he brought me in immediately and counseled me on my behavior. He didn’t yell or belittle me, but I got the point and was embarrassed that I had let him down. I’m a better person for it and I’d like to think that I have picked up his habits and that I emulate his actions by treating people the way they should be treated.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part04_ch01en7"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part04_ch01en7a">7</a></span></p>
<p class="indent1">We can overcome our baser instincts by acknowledging our inherent tendencies and working to focus our attention on the <a id="page_179"/>positive. It’s not just positive thinking; it’s rewiring our brains to recognize that our perceptions are not necessarily in line with truth, stopping to analyze our underlying assumptions about a situation, and questioning those assumptions until we get to a fuller picture. We can train our mirror-neuron systems—those cells discovered in recent decades that enable us to understand the actions of others, to interpret their intentions, and to predict what they might do next—to include positive behaviors and what they reveal about the people we coach.</p>
<p class="indent">And that is essential if we want to be authentic in our appreciation. We need to find a truthful positive point to begin from, and we need to show appreciation that resonates with the receiver. The best bosses, according to Robert Sutton, take the time to discover how each member of their teams think and act. It isn’t easy. Leaders, despite their best efforts, are often naturally removed from situations that may be the most revealing about individual personal dynamics. But making the effort is worth the payout in terms of influence and effectiveness as a leader.</p>
<p class="indent">When we acknowledge the value a person has to our organization, we establish a positive tone for open communication.</p>
<p class="indent">Of course, we must get around to the matter at hand eventually. Perhaps worse than attempting to get the bad news out of the way is attempting to soften it or simply not address it at all. This “Mum Effect”—a term coined by psychologists Sidney Rosen and Abraham Tesser in the early 1970s—happens because people want to avoid becoming the target of others’ negative emotions.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part04_ch01en8"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part04_ch01en8a">8</a></span> We all have the opportunity to lead change, yet it often requires of us the courage to deliver bad news to our superiors. We don’t want to be the innocent messenger who falls before a firing line. When our survival instincts kick in, they can override our courage until the truth of a situation gets watered down into pabulum. “The Mum Effect and the resulting filtering can have devastating effects in a steep hierarchy,” writes Sutton. <a id="page_180"/>“What starts out as bad news becomes happier and happier as it travels up the ranks—because after each boss hears the news from his or her subordinates, he or she makes it sound a bit less bad before passing it up the chain.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part04_ch01en9"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part04_ch01en9a">9</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">Leading with the positive and resisting the urge to promote drama are tools that can help us bolster our resolve, techniques for stepping confidently into the breach. And leaders who model this behavior are less likely to be blindsided by catastrophes they should have known about all along.</p>
<p class="indent">At Sonda, Andrés Navarro found a way to institutionalize this approach by adopting a three-for-one rule. “We try to criticize as little as we can. We have a rule. If you get into this company and you find someone whom you don’t like and you think doesn’t do his work the way he should, don’t say anything. Write it down on a piece of paper.” People are then required to discover at least three good things about the person before they can open a discussion designed to change the other’s behavior.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part04_ch01en10"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part04_ch01en10a">10</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">How, then, do we engage in interactions in which undesirable topics must be discussed? We know intuitively it is always easier to listen to unpleasant things after we have heard some praise of our good points. If the praise is contrived or if the segue from praise to criticism is too abrupt, then this principle will fail. To avoid this, consider the following.</p>
<p class="indent">First, the praise you offer must be genuine and heartfelt, not just a tool to bide time while you compose your criticisms.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, you must be able to create a smooth flow from point to point.</p>
<p class="indent">Third, offer constructive advice rather than criticism following the praise.</p>
<p class="indent">This style of communicating a point can be particularly difficult in written form. Without the natural flow of a conversation that presents opportunities to segue from one topic <a id="page_181"/>to the next, it may seem to the other person that you were just “buttering her up.” If the topic is particularly contentious, you should really have a face-to-face conversation.</p>
<p class="indent">Many people begin their criticism with sincere praise followed by the word “but,” which signals that the criticism is about to begin. This may make the listener question the sincerity of the praise. Use “and” instead, and provide constructive advice rather than criticism. This is possibly the most effective way to address an issue in written form without seeming false in your praise.</p>
<p class="indent">Beginning with praise and appreciation will help you help employees be more productive, vendors be more committed, and friends and family be more inclined to see your point of view. A positive outlook always places interactions on a positive path.<a id="page_182"/></p>
