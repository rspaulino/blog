<p class="paraspaceabove"><span class="big"><strong>I</strong></span>n the summer of 1941, Sergeant James Allen Ward was awarded the Victoria Cross for climbing out onto the wing of his Wellington bomber, thirteen thousand feet above Zuider Zee, to extinguish a fire in the starboard engine. Secured by only a rope around his waist, he managed to smother the fire and then return along the wing to the safety of the aircraft’s cabin. Winston Churchill, an admirer as well as a performer of swashbuckling exploits, summoned the shy New Zealander to 10 Downing Street. Ward, struck dumb with awe in Churchill’s presence, was unable to answer the prime minister’s questions. Churchill surveyed the unhappy hero with some compassion. “You must feel very humble and awkward in my presence,” he said.</p>
<p class="indent">“Yes sir,” managed Ward.</p>
<p class="indent">“Then you can imagine how humble and awkward I feel in yours,” said Churchill.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part04_ch05en1"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part04_ch05en1a">1</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">With just a few words, Churchill moved Ward from a miserable fool to the hero he was. He mitigated fault and helped Ward save face.</p>
<p class="indent">Few of us take the time to consider how to let another save face. We ride roughshod over others’ feelings, getting our own way, finding <a id="page_200"/>fault, issuing threats, criticizing a child or employee in front of others. We could offer a considerate word or two, take the other person’s feelings into account, pull them aside—anything to alleviate the sting. Yet many of us don’t take the time to do so.</p>
<p class="indent">For leaders, what does this insensitive behavior instill in those around us? Fear of failure. If we know we will be berated for our failures, possibly even publicly, will we take any risks in our work? Will we attempt to be innovative or creative? Will we speak up with ideas and opinions? Probably not.</p>
<p class="indent">Yet failure is an everyday part of our lives—at home, at work, in all of our endeavors. It is such a given that the venerable <em>Harvard Business Review</em> devoted its entire April 2011 issue to the subject. The cover heading and tagline? “The Failure Issue: How to Understand It, Learn from It, and Recover from It.” Not one mention of avoiding it.</p>
<p class="indent">Of course, we intuitively know that failure is inevitable, so why can’t we be more supportive when somebody is suffering through it?</p>
<p class="indent">An executive at a large media company was responsible for launching a new magazine. She spent a year’s worth of time, effort, and resources trying to get the fledgling publication off the ground, but it never flew. The magazine had to be cancelled.</p>
<p class="indent">The CEO of the company, who could have fired or demoted the executive for the failure or who could have held her up as an example of what <em>not</em> to do, instead provided a psychological safety net, allowing the executive to save face. “The CEO stood up at a gathering of the firm’s top executives and congratulated the failed executive for her courage and skill, for doing the wrong thing in the right way. He emphasized that the ill-fated decision wasn’t just hers; senior management backed it, and the magazine failed despite great content and marketing,” writes Robert Sutton in <em>Good Boss, Bad Boss</em>.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part04_ch05en2"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part04_ch05en2a">2</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">What this CEO epitomized in his actions was a technique <a id="page_201"/>that Sutton calls “forgive and remember,” a critical path for learning from mistakes and changing behavior. The technique was first described by Charles L. Bosk in his book <em>Forgive and Remember: Managing Medical Failure</em>.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part04_ch05en3"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part04_ch05en3a">3</a></span> The goal is to help individuals achieve accountability while managing the existential problem of failure, a demoralizing inner battle for anyone. Isn’t this the true responsibility of any leader? Because if the battle is lost, the individual will learn little from the mistake, have a diminished self-image, become fearful, and contribute less to the success of a company, a family, or any other organization.</p>
<p class="indent">Despite a leader’s best efforts, those in his care will fail. And he will fail. Recognizing this and the inherent benefits failure may present can help us learn how to help others come through it and land positively and securely on the opposite shore. Great leaders tap the creative and innovative power of their teams by helping them save face before they’ve even failed.</p>
<p class="indent">Fiona Lee, Amy Edmundson, and Stefan Thomke conducted a study with 688 employees in a large health care organization during the rollout of a new data system that integrated and presented data from all departments and divisions within the organization. The employees received little training and were told to learn the system by experimenting with it.<span class="c-tx-sup">3</span></p>
<p class="indent">The findings? In departments where managers specifically told their teams that making mistakes was okay and didn’t set up reward systems that penalized people who did make mistakes, experimentation with the system was much greater. In departments where managers were inconsistent in their messages or punished failure, even subtly, employees experimented with the system much less. In fact, lower-status employees in those departments didn’t use the system at all because of their greater fear of failure. As you might expect, the employees who experimented the most with the new, more efficient system <a id="page_202"/>became the most proficient with it and used it regularly in their everyday work.</p>
<p class="indent">What the supportive managers were actually developing within their team members, even if only on a small scale, was resilience. Resilience, explains Martin P. Seligman, author and positive psychology pioneer, is the difference in the ways people respond to failure. In his books and other writings, he describes how some people bounce back from failure, learning and growing from the experience, while others languish, becoming self-critical and fearful of the future. Which would you rather foster in the people in your life?</p>
<p class="indent">Companies who recruit from the military have learned the value of resilience well; they recognize that people in the military are used to dealing with mistakes and failures, sometimes on an almost moment-by-moment basis, and moving forward purposefully despite them.</p>
<p class="indent">Donovan Campbell, author of <em>Joker One,</em> a memoir about his experience as a platoon leader in Iraq, is part of PepsiCo’s elite Leadership Development Program. He explains the perspective he gained while commanding a platoon.</p>
<p class="blockquote1">In school you’re rewarded for not making mistakes. And then you get out and get a job, and a lot of times you get promoted because you make very few mistakes. And so what you do is you develop a mindset that mistakes are to be avoided at all costs. What you learn in the military is that it doesn’t matter how hard you try or how good you are. One, you will make mistakes; and two, sometimes events or the enemy or a changing situation will mean that you do not succeed, and in fact you fail. And you become comfortable with the idea.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part04_ch05en4"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part04_ch05en4a">4</a></span></p>
<p class="indent1">This mature approach to failure, as opposed to being frozen in a state of indecisiveness or inaction, is what we want from <a id="page_203"/>our employees and our leaders. Making it safe for them to fail is a sure way to ensure that they will more readily admit their mistakes (which is a key aspect of leadership we’ve explored), more quickly recover from them, more fully learn from them. As a leader, you will gain a more complete picture of their work and become a better coach and mentor for it.</p>
<p class="indent">So how do we create this type of environment? Charlene Li, in her important book <em>Open Leadership,</em> maps out five actions that leaders can take to instill organizational resilience within their teams:</p>
<p class="bulletlista">• <em>Acknowledge that failure happens.</em> Leaders can acknowledge failures quickly when they happen, but they can also discuss with their teams the likelihood of failures occurring.</p>
<p class="bulletlist">• <em>Encourage dialogue to foster trust.</em> Honestly discussing problems is the best way to learn from them and to trim the seedlings before they become fully grown catastrophes.</p>
<p class="bulletlist">• <em>Separate the person from the failure.</em> Rather than saying “you failed,” say “the project failed.” In most cases, that is the truth. Amy Edmondson, Harvard professor and researcher, explored this point with executives. “When I ask executives to . . . estimate how many of the failures in their organizations are truly blameworthy, their answers are usually in single digits—perhaps 2% to 5%. But when I ask how many are treated as blameworthy, they say (after a pause or a laugh) 70% to 90%. The unfortunate consequence is that many failures go unreported and their lessons are lost.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part04_ch05en5"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part04_ch05en5a">5</a></span></p>
<p class="bulletlist">• <em>Learn from your mistakes.</em> Otherwise, they are lost opportunities for learning and for coaching.</p>
<p class="bulletlist">• <em>Create a risk-taking and failure system.</em> Being methodical about how we approach risk and failure can help mitigate some of the emotional responses to it.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_204"/>Why go to these lengths? Alberto Alessi, the great Italian designer, described his company’s approach to design as an effort to find the borderline between what is possible and what is not possible and design along it. The best designs are those that fall right on the edge of the borderline, just this side of possible. That is the space of innovation, the space where we test our talents and grow as individuals. Of course, hugging the line means that you will often flop over it—you will fall into the realm of the impossible and fail. But what a glorious failure it will be, and who knows what might be learned from it. Famed vacuum cleaner designer Sir Richard Dyson produced more than five thousand prototypes before bringing his first product to market.</p>
<p class="indent">What we must remember when faced with a person who has made a mistake is that how he handles it is dependent on the support he receives while living through the tough moment and learning from it. A primary difference between ordinary and extraordinary people is how they perceive and respond to failure. A good leader can influence which camp we fall into.</p>
<p class="indent">Now, there are mistakes and then there are “mistakes.” Some mistakes come about from minor lapses in judgment, from inexperience, from the need for coaching. These are actual mistakes. Others come about from recklessness, greed, a lack of concern for others’ well-being, and a desire to elevate oneself at the expense of others. In these instances, it’s highly likely that the person at fault actually feels no remorse, no sense of accountability. Is it appropriate to help such an individual save face? Possibly not. If the mistake and attitude are severe enough, it’s likely that helping the other person save face would just exacerbate the problem. In these instances, it’s best to keep public comments to a minimum and use private conversations to address the severity of the issue as deftly as possible.</p>
<p class="indent">Other than creating an environment in which people are not <a id="page_205"/>pilloried for their mistakes when part of a larger whole, Charlene Li’s advice can be transferred to situations when we should help an individual save face to recover from a minor error, oversight, or gaffe.</p>
<p class="bulletlista">• Acknowledge that a mistake was made, but do it gently. Pretending that nothing happened certainly meets the “forgive” criteria, but it seems a little disingenuous when the error was blatant.</p>
<p class="bulletlist">• Recognize and address your own role, even if minor.</p>
<p class="bulletlist">• Focus on what was gained.</p>
<p class="bulletlist">• When appropriate to do so without making others culpable, address the issue from a broad perspective.</p>
<p class="indent1">Imagine that you are at a function and are introduced to somebody you’ve met before, but he clearly doesn’t remember you. You could say, “We’ve met before,” throwing his error in his face. Or you could say, “Oh, hello, Mark. It’s nice to see you again. Did I see you at the Better Business Bureau lunch last month? It was a great networking event, although there were so many people, it was a bit overwhelming.”</p>
<p class="indent">Today, our faults, missteps, and outright failures are so much more public than they once were. When an employee makes a mistake, it’s not surprising when a customer starts blogging about it, posts the experience on her Facebook page, or shoots off a quick email tirade to the CEO of the company. The employee is already in a position to feel humiliated and fearful. Why make it worse? Allowing others to save face is crucial in the digital age.</p>
<p class="indent">Of course, helping someone save face is sometimes more difficult to do because his failures have been broadcast. It is important to maintain strict discipline in terms of what you write in emails. An email accidentally sent to the wrong person or <a id="page_206"/>hacked and posted on a blog may not only cause embarrassment but also ruin somebody’s professional reputation. If you need to discuss a mistake or gaffe that somebody made, it’s best to do it in person or over the phone. Save your written communication for praise and constructive advice.</p>
<p class="indent">While it’s important to help others weather their failures gracefully, helping a customer or potential customer save face can be useful as a business tactic. Wolfgang Schmidt explained how his company, Rubbermaid, uses the technique to win new customers:</p>
<p class="blockquote1">We do get complaints. About half those complaints come about as a result of a consumer buying a product, thinking it’s ours, but it’s a competitor’s product. So the consumer writes to us. Our policy is simply to write a personal letter and say, “We can understand how you made the mistake because we have these competitors who copy our products. You made an honest mistake, but we would like for you to see directly the difference in value. So try one of ours for free.” We send them our replacement product for whatever it is they complained about. And we think that’s a wonderful way to communicate very credibly the story of Rubbermaid value.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part04_ch05en6"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part04_ch05en6a">6</a></span></p>
<p class="indent1">Even if the other person is wrong, we only destroy ego by causing someone to lose face. We do nothing to change his or her behavior.</p>
<p class="indent">On the other hand, when we mitigate fault, we not only save the other person’s psyche, we build confidence and trust into our relationship with that person. Save someone’s face once and your influence with him rises. Save his face every time you can, and there is practically nothing he won’t do for you.</p>
