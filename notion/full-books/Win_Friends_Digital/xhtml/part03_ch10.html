<p class="paraspaceabove"><span class="big"><strong>W</strong></span>hen it comes to discussions about the best players in NBA history, two names usually come up: Larry and Magic.</p>
<p class="indent">Larry Bird and Earvin “Magic” Johnson were, individually, two of the most compelling players to ever grace the hardwood courts—gifted passers who possessed almost otherworldly senses of players and positions on the basketball court. They were virtually unrivaled in clutch situations. They prided themselves for their defense as much as for their offense, and they worked harder than any of their teammates.</p>
<p class="indent">And they defined basketball for a decade. Magic beat Larry in the 1979 NCAA championship, then beat him again in the 1984 NBA Championship. Larry beat Magic in 1985 and then lost to him again in 1987.</p>
<p class="indent">For most of their careers they didn’t much like each other, but their respect for each other knew no bounds. Then in 1991, Magic was unexpectedly forced to retire from professional basketball because he contracted HIV. The day after Magic’s announcement, Bird found himself preparing for a regular-season game. He stretched his back, loosened up by jogging through the corridors of the arena, shot baskets from his usual <a id="page_168"/>spots on the floor . . . and for the first time in his life he had no desire to play. His competitor, who by then had become his friend, was gone from the sport. Magic had played a major role in making Bird who he was.</p>
<p class="indent">A few months later, at his retirement ceremony, Magic said, “I want to thank Larry Bird personally for bringing out the best in Magic Johnson because, without you, I could have never risen to the top.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch10en1"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch10en1a">1</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">Some people seem to think that competition is a dirty word. It isn’t. Competition is one of the most compelling realities of the natural world. While connection is necessary to keep us thriving, competition is necessary to keep us striving.</p>
<p class="indent">“As iron sharpens iron,” wrote King Solomon, Israel’s third monarch, “so one man sharpens another.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch10en2"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch10en2a">2</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">The sound of iron sharpening iron is about as subtle as the sound of fingernails on a chalkboard. But King Solomon recognized that the only way to get the best out of yourself and others is to challenge and collide. While a life of permanent interpersonal pleasantries appears more comfortable and sounds more peaceful, a relationally complacent life is a fruitless life.</p>
<p class="indent">A challenge doesn’t have to involve blood, sweat, and tears. Coke issued a challenge to consumers in a 2010 social media ad campaign—they challenged people not to smile.</p>
<p class="indent">Coke set up a special vending machine on a real college campus. This machine didn’t just dispense soft drinks. It surprised students with everything from free bottles of Coke to a bouquet of flowers, a pizza, and a six-foot sub.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch10en3"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch10en3a">3</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">The cameras caught it all, and the results were streamed to YouTube. The sheer joy and surprise of the students receiving the gifts—some high-fiving, others hugging, all smiling and laughing—also put smiles on the faces of the nearly four million viewers who watched it online. The challenge to viewers was not <a id="page_169"/>to smile, and it garnered millions of willing failures, just as Coke had hoped for.</p>
<p class="indent">One of the things that drove the early, wild days of the Internet was the passionate competition between Microsoft and AOL. Easily forgotten in this era of Apple and Google, the AOL/Microsoft battle accelerated the availability of cutting-edge services for the customer. Each company envisioned the day when consumers would perform the majority of their transactions online, get most of their information online, and live a big chunk of their lives online.</p>
<p class="indent">The companies loathed each other, and their cultures were vastly different—one was a consumer-oriented marketing company that happened to use technology and the other was a technology company that happened to use consumer marketing.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch10en4"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch10en4a">4</a></span> AOL testified against Microsoft in the antitrust trial against the giant software company. And yet that competition made both companies larger and more successful than either would have been without the other.</p>
<p class="indent">Yes, everyone faces challenges in their lives, and people commonly say it doesn’t matter what the challenge is; what matters is how one responds to it.</p>
<p class="indent">True enough.</p>
<p class="indent">Some people get injured or sick or hurt and give up. They put themselves on the conveyor belt to the grave.</p>
<p class="indent">Others rise to great heights. Take Teddy Roosevelt, for example. A sickly child, young Teddy had life-threatening asthma. Oftentimes he struggled to breathe, and the asthma weakened his heart. Then, when he was twelve, his father put down a challenge: “Theodore, you have the mind but you have not the body, and without the help of the body the mind cannot go as far as it should. You must make your body. It’s hard drudgery to make one’s body, but I know you will do it.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch10en5"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch10en5a">5</a></span></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_170"/>In response, the boy half grinned and half snarled—the first reported instance of the look that would become known the world over. He then jerked his head back and replied through clenched teeth, “I’ll make my body.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch10en6"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch10en6a">6</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">Over the next year his life consisted of strenuous exercise. And as his strength grew, so did his boldness and daring. He plunged into icy rivers and climbed seven mountains, including one of them twice in a single day. And as he did these things his obsession with nature began. Everything from birds to moss fascinated him, and he collected several hundred specimens for preservation in the “Roosevelt Museum of Natural History.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch10en7"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch10en7a">7</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">Without his father’s challenge, what might have become of such a sickly boy? The challenge changed him forever.</p>
<p class="indent">It is also true, however, that the challenge itself is just as important as the response to it. Challenges that inspire and compel are very different from challenges that discourage and depress.</p>
<p class="indent">In 2010, Shaun King, pastor of Courageous Church in Atlanta, wanted to raise money for a permanent home for disabled Haitian orphans. But how to do it? This was the first challenge. In the digital age, creativity in such matters is greatly expanded. He wanted to reach the biggest audience possible with the message. He came up with the idea for a celebrity charity auction with a twist. People wouldn’t be bidding for a picture, an autograph, or a date. They’d bid for a celebrity to follow them on Twitter and retweet their posts. He approached <em>Desperate Housewives</em> star Eva Longoria Parker with the challenge. She jumped in and then challenged her celebrity buddies to become part of it as well. They did, and TwitChange was born.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch10en8"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch10en8a">8</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">In 2010, more than 175 celebrities with a combined ninety million followers garnered thirty million hits and raised more than $500,000.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch10en9"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch10en9a">9</a></span> That’s the power of a meaningful challenge in an age where our reach is long and influence expansive.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_171"/>There are pernicious half-truths in the world, but few are as disturbing as “Go along to get along.” That isn’t a way to live a life, raise a family, or run a business. People don’t want to be leveled down; they want to be leveled up. They want their vision raised, and sometimes that means throwing down a challenge.</p>
<p class="indent">Charles Schwab once said, “The way to get things done is to stimulate competition.” When we compete, we are striving to win because winning generates a feeling of success and importance. When victory is defined as team victory—for a cause, a country, a cure, or a company—winning is all the more compelling, because the competition forces us to communicate and connect on an area of affinity. The competition comes to mean as much to us for its camaraderie as for its ultimate result.</p>
<p class="indent">Look around your sphere of influence for an area of affinity that can generate a competition that can mean something more than reaching the finish line—something that can mean lasting friendships and corporate influence for positive change. If it’s one person you’d like to help change, throw down a compelling challenge that gets you both involved in the arena. Nobody said challenges were clean endeavors. Get dirty for the sake of others, and they will get dirty for you.<a id="page_172"/></p>
