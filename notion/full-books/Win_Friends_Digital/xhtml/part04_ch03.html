<p class="paraspaceabove"><span class="big"><strong>D</strong></span>uring the first days of his presidency, Coolidge and his family had not yet left their third-floor suite at the Willard Hotel in Washington. In the early morning hours the president awoke to see a cat burglar going through his clothes, removing a wallet and a watch chain. Coolidge spoke: “I wish you wouldn’t take that. . . . I don’t mean the watch and chain, only the charm. Read what is engraved on the back of it.”</p>
<p class="indent">The burglar read: “Presented to Calvin Coolidge, Speaker of the House, by the Massachusetts General Court.”</p>
<p class="indent">Coolidge then identified himself as the president, persuaded the burglar to relinquish the watch charm, led him into a quiet conversation, found out that the young man and his college roommate were unable to pay their hotel bill and buy train tickets back to their campus, counted out $32 from the wallet (which the dazed young man had also relinquished), declared it to be a loan, and advised the student that in order to avoid the Secret Service, he should leave as unconventionally as he had entered.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part04_ch03en1"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part04_ch03en1a">1</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">Calling attention indirectly to someone’s mistakes or missteps works wonders with people who may resent any direct criticism—and that defines most people.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_188"/>Leaders of all kinds have a fantastic tool available to them for sending a subtle message about the behavior they are trying to encourage. They simply have to model that behavior themselves. And if they do not, the message to those around them will be loud and clear: “I tell you I want you to behave in such a way, but it’s not actually that important. Otherwise, I would do it myself.”</p>
<p class="indent">This concept is John Maxwell’s thirteenth law of leadership in his classic <em>The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership</em>. He calls it “The Law of the Picture” because people do what they see. He tells the story of platoon leader Dick Winters of Easy Company during World War II. Winters believed that it was an officer’s responsibility to go first, set an example, lead the charge, and take risks alongside his men.</p>
<p class="blockquote1">One of the most remarkable incidents demonstrating Winters’s way of leading by example occurred soon after D-Day on the road to Carentan, a town that Easy Company need to take from the Germans. As the American paratroopers under his command approached the town, they became pinned down by German machine-gun fire. Huddled in ditches on either side of the road, they wouldn’t move forward when ordered to. Yet if they didn’t move, they would eventually be cut to pieces. Winters tried rallying them. He coaxed them. He kicked them. He ran from one ditch to the other as machine-gun bullets flew by. Finally, he jumped into the middle of the road, bullets glancing off the ground near him, and shouted at the men to get moving. Everyone got up and moved forward as one. And they helped to take the town.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part04_ch03en2"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part04_ch03en2a">2</a></span></p>
<p class="indent1">At times it isn’t possible to influence others by modeling behavior, either because you aren’t with the people you are trying to influence or because you actually aren’t immersed in what <a id="page_189"/>it is that they are doing. How do we influence behavior then? The authors of <em>Influencer</em> offer some compelling advice for these situations:</p>
<p class="bulletlista">• Identify those in the group, team, family, or community who have the most influence over others and get them to model the behavior you want to promote.</p>
<p class="bulletlist">• Develop a community approach to the behavior by appealing to the broader good. Peer pressure goes a long way toward influencing the thoughts and actions of individuals.</p>
<p class="bulletlist">• Make any changes possible to the resources available or the environment to make the new behavior or mind-set easy to adopt.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part04_ch03en3"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part04_ch03en3a">3</a></span></p>
<p class="indent1">At the end of World War II, soldiers were returning from the front lines and reentering the workforce. In the process, they were displacing the women who had stepped up and filled many positions in their absence. Many women chose to remain in the workforce, which created animosity between the sexes in the workplace but also gave rise to a new view of the role women could play in the American economy.</p>
<p class="indent">Restaurants around the country were facing a particular struggle. The returning soldiers were granted positions as cooks. The women who had held those positions were demoted to waitresses, positions of lower pay. The result: an antagonistic relationship between cooks and waitresses in an environment in which cooperation is a necessity. Everybody suffered, including the patrons, who often received late or wrong orders. Employees were quitting and restaurants were losing customers.</p>
<p class="indent">So the National Restaurant Association enlisted the help of William Foote Whyte, a professor at the University of Chicago, <a id="page_190"/>to solve the problem. He observed the activity in a sample of restaurants, watching as cooks and waitresses slung insults, ignored each other, and behaved vindictively (at the expense of the customer).</p>
<p class="indent">“While many consultants might have been tempted to alter this unhealthy social climate by teaching interpersonal skills, conducting team-building exercises, or changing the pay system, Whyte took a different approach,” explained the authors. “In his view, the best way to solve the problem was to change the way employees communicated.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part04_ch03en4"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part04_ch03en4a">4</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">Working with a pilot restaurant, Whyte recommended they use a simple metal spindle to place orders with the kitchen. The waitresses would put the orders on the spindle and the cooks would fulfill the orders in whatever way was most efficient, but making sure that those that were placed first were prioritized.</p>
<p class="indent">The results were immediate: decreased conflict, decreased customer complaints, and communication and behavior that were more respectful on both sides.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes the best way to correct behavior is not to openly punish the wrong behavior but to use the situation as a platform for building self-confidence and deeper connection. Bob Hoover, a famous test pilot and frequent performer at air shows, was flying back to his home in Los Angeles from an air show in San Diego. At three hundred feet in the air, both engines suddenly stopped. By deft maneuvering he managed to land the plane and save himself and two others on board. But it was badly damaged.</p>
<p class="indent">Hoover’s first act after the emergency landing was to inspect the airplane’s fuel. Just as he suspected, the World War II propeller plane had been fueled with jet fuel rather than gasoline. Upon returning to the airport, he asked to see the mechanic who had serviced his airplane. The young man was sick with the agony of his mistake. Tears streamed down his face as Hoover <a id="page_191"/>approached. He had just caused the loss of a very expensive plane and could have caused the loss of three lives as well.</p>
<p class="indent">You can imagine Hoover’s anger. One could anticipate the tongue-lashing that this proud and precise pilot would unleash for such carelessness. But Hoover didn’t scold the mechanic; he didn’t even criticize his gross negligence. Instead, he threw his big arm around the man’s shoulder and said, “To show you I’m sure that you’ll never do this again, I want you to service my F-51 tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="indent">In life, sometimes mistakes are the by-product of extenuating circumstances. We don’t always fail at work because of incompetence. We can fail because our hearts and minds are not engaged due to problems at home or elsewhere. The leader understands that mistakes and failures surface from all corners of life and, therefore, should be treated as isolated and redeemable instances rather than fatal flaws.</p>
<p class="indent">In an age where emerging leaders are skeptical of inauthentic leadership tactics, it is best to confront mistakes honestly while not using them as opportunities for condemnation. To many, passive-aggressive approaches or manipulative encounters with leaders diminish their view of that particular leader and make them cynical about their contribution to the task at hand or even the organization they serve. It is to your advantage to pull people out of their dejected state as quickly as possibly. Do so by calling out their mistakes quietly and returning them to a place of confidence and strength.<a id="page_192"/></p>
