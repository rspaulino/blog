<p class="paraspaceabove"><span class="big"><strong>A</strong></span>t a dinner party, George Bernard Shaw sat next to a young man who proved to be a bore of historic proportions. After suffering through a seemingly interminable monologue, Shaw cut in to observe that between the two of them, they knew everything there was to know in the world.</p>
<p class="indent">“How is that?” asked the young man.</p>
<p class="indent">“Well,” said Shaw, “you seem to know everything except that you’re a bore. And I know that!”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch05en1"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch05en1a">1</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">Not quite the impression the young man was aiming for. But it proves an important point: when it comes to mattering to others, you must discuss what matters to them. Assume all else will fall on deaf, or in this case dull, ears.</p>
<p class="indent">This is an interesting principle to consider given the spirit in which the vast majority of people communicate today. Most messages are primarily meant to educate others about our lives or our products, to reveal compelling portions of ourselves we think others would be attracted to. While this appears to be an assertive strategy, it is actually a passive strategy in that it requires <a id="page_80"/>others to connect with us. Like a banner ad on a website waiting to be clicked, we offer up digital ads of our best selves, hoping others will be compelled to engage.</p>
<p class="indent">The trouble is, that’s marketing monologue, not relational dialogue. It’s assumption, not assimilation. When assumption guides our efforts to befriend or influence others, the results end up on the wrong side of memorable.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1810, U.S. general William Henry Harrison, then governor of the Indiana Territory, was negotiating with Tecumseh in order to try to prevent open hostilities. He ordered a chair to be brought for the Native American chief. The man who brought it said, “Your father, General Harrison, offers you a seat.”</p>
<p class="indent">“My father!” Tecumseh exclaimed. “The sun is my father and the earth is my mother, and on her breast I will lie.” Ignoring the chair, he stretched himself out on the ground.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch05en2"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch05en2a">2</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">Today’s biggest enemy of lasting influence is the sector of both personal and corporate musing that concerns itself with the art of creating impressions without consulting the science of need ascertainment. Not only is this method presumptuous, but it is a poor business tack. What the world needs more of—what Carnegie espoused seventy-five years ago—is bridge-building dialogue. This begins when you flip the modern spirits of marketing and social media on their heads and begin all interactions with a mind for what matters to the other person.</p>
<p class="indent">This starts, as we have said, with listening. Once you know what matters to others through a practice of longer listening, you can then truly engage them by putting such matters at the forefront of your interactions. If you’re talking business, this process is about putting the customer back into customer relationship management—an endeavor that blogger Doc Searls once pointed out is more often about management than the customer.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch05en3"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch05en3a">3</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">“Everyone is wrong about influence,” writes power blogger and business strategist Valeria Maltoni, “except your customers.”</p>
<p class="blockquote1"><a id="page_81"/>Think about that before you get into trouble for not delivering meaningful results. . . . True influence flows from drawing together people with shared interests. It’s a process of identifying areas of relevancy among your customers and prospects, community building and allowing others to amplify your influence as you meet their needs. . . . You’ll be chasing the popular kids (even those who demur) until the cows come home if you keep thinking that influence is about you. It’s not. And you don’t need the following of a celebrity to build something of significance.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch05en4"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch05en4a">4</a></span></p>
<p class="indent1">You are ultimately building a community when you initiate interactions with what matters to others. And a community is what really matters to you, whether you’re building a brick-and-mortar business, launching a new brand, or planning an important reunion. Sure, there is an initial connection, and you need to make it. But much of marketing and social media today is only about the connection point—gaining another follower, notching another fan, claiming another customer. Often forgotten is the long-term plan. Businesses call it a customer retention strategy, but it is best thought of as a lively, meaningful dialogue among a community of friends.</p>
<p class="indent">If the foundation of all long-term success is the establishment of trust-based relationships, then the goal of all interactions should be to convey value as soon and as often as possible. There are common hurdles to overcome.</p>
<p class="indent">Jason travels to Senegal’s most remote regions a few times a year. He first traveled with a nonprofit that led him there. He returns today because he still learns there. Recently one of the village elders pulled him aside on a 115-degree afternoon to ask him a most urgent question: How did people in North America live?</p>
<p class="indent">Jason explained that most lived in individual houses somewhat akin to the huts in the village. Others lived in <a id="page_82"/>apartments stacked on top of and next to each other to form bigger buildings.</p>
<p class="indent">“And all of these homes,” the elder inquired, “they have walls all around?”</p>
<p class="indent">Yes, replied Jason.</p>
<p class="indent">“But why?”</p>
<p class="indent">“To keep themselves safe from bad weather and sometimes from bad people and to protect the things in their home and to give privacy.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Oh, no, no, no,” the elder replied. “That is backward.” In their village, he explained, they had torn down the walls to keep themselves safe. “You see, too many things hide behind walls. If we tear down the walls for all to see, then we are all safer.”</p>
<p class="indent">We live in a modern world, and in the modern world we put up walls. There are firewalls for our computers, mortar walls for our estates, and wood and wire fences for our farms and family yards. Then there is the great wall of diffuse social interaction. It can lead to a level of influence that exists outside relationship—an influence founded on followership but not friendship.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Open Leadership</em> author and social media maven Charlene Li warns about the danger of such fortified digital influence. In a recent interview she noted the biggest concern—a false sense of security. “There is a difference between a friend and a fan,” she explained. “Fans have a smaller sense of commitment, smaller levels of interest. There is a continuum of loyalty whereby fans stand at one end and friends at the other. Influence occurs across the continuum but it is more certain and lasting on the friends’ end.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch05en5"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch05en5a">5</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">The easiest way to prove Li’s point is to go online and try to buy a Facebook friend. It can’t be done. Companies galore will sell you Facebook fans, and they can assure you of lots of Twitter followers, but leave it to social media to shine a bright light on the great truth that no true friend can be bought.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_83"/>“When are we going to learn that millions of followers does not always equal influence?” blogged Canadian Mitch Joel, author of Six Pixels of Separation and one of the iMedia 25: Internet Marketing Leaders and Innovators.</p>
<p class="blockquote1">It’s a game (err . . . business) that worked well until the proper analytics and platforms were put in place. . . . [S]maller, stronger groups are where influence lies. . . . The brands that are winning “true influence” . . . are winning (as opposed to #winning) because they have people who are having real interactions with other real human beings (and those interactions are truly meaningful). . . . [I]t is much more practical/realistic for businesses to think about using these opportunities to connect and have a sincere engagement instead of trying to rack up their numbers.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch05en6"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch05en6a">6</a></span></p>
<p class="indent1">Newton Minow was the influential head of the Federal Communications Commission under President John F. Kennedy. He later went on to serve in various other prestigious public and private sector jobs. When asked what his secret was, he said that it all came down to his college major. He’d majored in semantics—the study of meaning. Semantics isn’t simply about words; it’s about the context in which those words are used. It’s about understanding.</p>
<p class="indent">He once remarked that 99 percent of all conflicts are about the misunderstanding of words used in different contexts. His success, therefore, came from trying diligently to understand what someone meant.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch05en7"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch05en7a">7</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">The endeavor is all the more significant today because when Mark Zuckerberg decided to call everyone on Facebook “friends” he made a semantic choice that is easily misunderstood. The human brain—to say nothing of the human heart—cannot <a id="page_84"/>process hundreds of friends. According to Oxford University professor of evolutionary anthropology Robin Dunbar, the size of our brain limits our ability to manage social circles to around 150 friends, regardless of our sociability.</p>
<p class="indent">Dunbar has looked at Facebook and found it to be true online as well. “The interesting thing is that you can have 1,500 friends but when you actually look at traffic on sites, you see people maintain the same inner circle of around 150 people that we observe in the real world.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch05en8"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch05en8a">8</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">But here it is important to introduce Dunbar to Minow, because Dunbar defines a friend as someone you care about and contact at least once a year. Distinctions must be made, for while we cannot have 150 intimate friends, we can have 150 influential relationships.</p>
<p class="indent">Intimate friendships possess deep commitment and are based on great risk—first comes the risk of believing that we are people who matter enough, who are weighty enough, to influence others’ lives. If we do not understand the significance of our presence, we can never give anyone the present of our lives. But an equally great risk is that having intimate friends opens us up to being deeply hurt by those friends. Some people protect themselves from relational pain by having no intimate friends. Others do it by having so many shallow friends that a hurt inflicted by one is diffused by the mass.</p>
<p class="indent">The bottom line is that relationship involves risk, and if we want to influence other people’s lives, we have to be comfortable accepting that risk. While the amount we give of ourselves varies based on the relational intimacy we are seeking, risk is always implicit in the process of moving people from curious followers to certain friends with whom you have influence that transcends transactional trends. Once you know what matters to others through a practice of listening, placing your matters in a holding pattern is the <a id="page_85"/>only way to truly engage others with a steady diet of what they care about. And as with most meaningful risks, the reward is commensurate. Subsequent influence is more potent, and there soon comes a time when what matters to you matters to them.</p>
<p class="indent">Jamie Tworkowski understands. In 2002 a friend named Renee was using the same razor blade to line her cocaine and cut her arms. Depressed, alone, and surrounded by “friends” who were spiraling down with her, Renee was not long for this world.</p>
<p class="indent">Jamie, an unassuming surfboard sales rep, stepped in and with a group of friends intervened in Renee’s world. Eschewing emotional risk, they tried to give her the gift of presence. They bought her coffee and cigarettes, they gave her music, they surrounded her with love. They wondered what it would be like if, instead of her cutting a self-loathing, four-letter moniker into her arm, they could write love on her arms.</p>
<p class="indent">Jamie’s friendship with Renee led him to design some T-shirts to sell to support the cost of her recovery program. His friendship with the lead singer of a popular rock band led him to ask a favor of the front man: “Wear one of our T-shirts onstage.” The musician did.</p>
<p class="indent">Nearly a decade later, Renee is clean and Jamie’s organization, To Write Love on Her Arms, sells nearly $3 million in T-shirts a year and invests that money in numerous recovery programs.</p>
<p class="indent">More than 200,000 follow Jamie on Twitter and Facebook. But he knows most are curious fans and followers. A much smaller number are friends, such as Renee.</p>
<p class="indent">He has some slight influence with those who follow him; yet it is shallower than the influence he has with his friends, and mostly fleeting. He accepts this and celebrates that there are others in the world also doing good things worthy of following.</p>
<p class="indent">He has strong influence with his friends; this is the malleable setting in which he chooses to reside. It is this place—different <a id="page_86"/>for everyone—where you must reside, whether you’re a multinational corporation or an individual change agent.</p>
<p class="indent">The distinction between your friends and your followers is an important one to consider when seeking to make a lasting impression on others. There are those in this world with whom you have earned significant influence; they are a gift and a responsibility. You should not only know who they are but also always know what matters to them. The gift is what they bring to you; value it. The responsibility is to lead your relationship somewhere meaningful to both of you—but at the very least, to them.</p>
<p class="indent">“A brand’s ability to have its message put in front of millions of people begins and ends with that impression,” concludes Mitch Joel in his aforementioned blog post.</p>
<p class="blockquote1">We (as a public) seem to believe that the influence comes from the sheer volume of impressions and connections that we have in the marketplace. . . . It doesn’t. True influence comes from connecting to the individuals, nurturing those relationships, adding real value to the other [people]’s lives and doing anything and everything to serve them, so that when the time comes for you to make an ask, there is someone there to lend a hand. Worry less about how many people you are connected to and worry a whole lot more about who you are connected to, who they are and what you are doing to value and honor them.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch05en9"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch05en9a">9</a></span></p>
<p class="indent1">Perhaps what is most meaningful to you, after all, is being meaningful to others. One thing is certain: In an age when the mass of messages multiplies daily, only a small number really matter. To influence others, make sure yours are among them.</p>
