<p class="paraspaceabove"><span class="big"><strong>T</strong></span>he Academy Award–winning film <em>The King’s Speech</em> tells the story of how a common man with an uncommon touch helped a stuttering prince become a king who would rally a nation.</p>
<p class="indent">Prince Albert, Duke of York, had a stammering problem that hindered every part of his life. He had trouble telling stories to his children, trouble communicating in public speeches, and trouble speaking on the radio, the latest technology of the day. In searching out a cure for his ailment, the prince met with an Australian-born speech therapist named Lionel Logue. Logue’s methods were unconventional, in no small part because he believed stammering was as much a psychological problem as it was a physical one.</p>
<p class="indent">The film shows how the prince, known as Bertie to his family, resists Logue’s entreaties, and the rest of the film recounts the rising tension between the men as the stakes are raised and Prince Albert, Duke of York, becomes King George VI, rex imperator, and world war looms.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, in a breakthrough moment as they prepare for his coronation, the soon-to-be king snaps and lets loose with all of his fears—that he will fail his nation and become a laughingstock for all of history.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_16"/>“Bertie,” Logue interjects, “you’re the bravest man that I know.”</p>
<p class="indent">Bertie stops and considers the weight of those words. They portend life-changing impact.</p>
<p class="indent">If Emerson was right when he remarked, “The ancestor of every action is a thought,” then what Logue had done was that most brilliant of influence strategies.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part01_ch02en1"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part01_ch02en1a">1</a></span> He had introduced a thought that had theretofore never been considered. Bertie, the stammering prince, wasn’t weak. He wasn’t a loser or a laughingstock. The lifetime of teasing he’d endured and the very picture he had of himself weren’t telling the full story. There was something in him that was more fundamentally true, something that was good . . . maybe even great.</p>
<p class="indent">Bertie embraced it. And ultimately he would become a different man because one person had the discernment to affirm in him something others had let his shortcomings obscure.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part01_ch02en2"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part01_ch02en2a">2</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">Contrast Logue’s actions with those of dismissed NPR executive vice president Ron Schiller, who was caught on video articulating his disparagement of those political parties with which he did not associate. The primary difference between the two approaches is ultimately a matter of choice.</p>
<p class="indent">Neither Bertie nor any political party is without its share of faults. It is not as though Lionel Logue had a more righteous subject with which to deal than did Ron Schiller. Both could find reasons to denounce their subjects. Logue simply took the more influential path, the path that held human dignity in the highest regard. Schiller took a path in which he forgot himself and his fellow humans. It isn’t difficult to see which path is wiser.</p>
<p class="indent">One ancient and powerful Jewish parable involves a shepherd guarding one hundred sheep. They are under his care and he will not let them down. However, at roundup one evening he notices one is gone. Just one. Ninety-nine are safe and secure. What does <a id="page_17"/>the shepherd do? Does he say a prayer and hope the sheep shows up before a wolf nabs him? No, he pens the ninety-nine and goes looking. That one sheep is of such magnificent importance the shepherd cannot bear to see him left alone.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part01_ch02en3"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part01_ch02en3a">3</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">Consider the message this sends to the sheep, not just the one but also the other ninety-nine who look to the shepherd for provision and protection. Now consider sending that same message to those you’d like to influence. Have you let them know just how valuable you think they are? There is great power in this simple principle, embodied regularly.</p>
<p class="indent">We all have an innate, unquenchable desire to know we are valued, to know we matter. Yet affirming this in each other is among the most challenging things to do in our day and age.</p>
<p class="indent">How obsessed we can be with the least important, most superficial things around. Weeks of life spent bantering about some celebrity’s latest style or some athlete’s latest sin. Hours observing the sociology of a household of clamoring college students. Even if we aren’t caught up in the often maniacal musings of pop culture, the demands on our time can still be so intense it seems difficult to dig down deep on anything. When we have a torrent of text messages, email bins that are overflowing, and networks offering ceaseless socializing, even that spouse we courted so passionately can become an inconvenience. Then there are the kids and grandparents and neighbors and so on. Who has time to affirm the good about anything save perhaps a neighbor’s new car or kitchen? That’s quick and painless.</p>
<p class="indent">The problem is that quick and painless can also be mundane and meaningless. It is for these reasons that employing this principle matters so much today.</p>
<p class="indent">Affirming the good in others should not however be confused with flattery.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_18"/>The difference? Genuine concern.</p>
<p class="indent">A young, unkempt college student once asked Muhammad Ali what he should do with his life. He could not decide whether to continue his education or go out into the world to seek his fortune. It was clear he was leaning toward the latter. “Stay in college, get the education,” advised Ali. “If they can make penicillin out of moldy bread, they can make something out of you!”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part01_ch02en4"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part01_ch02en4a">4</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">Ali was clearly making light of the situation. Ultimately he understood what the kid had likely been told his whole life, and he used a bit of levity to make a significant point: “Don’t give up so easily. Stay the course. Despite what you’ve been told, you matter and you can accomplish something great.”</p>
<p class="indent">Affirmation, in contrast to flattery, requires seeing someone well enough to sense what to affirm, knowing someone well enough to be aware of what really matters. Flattery is usually an admittance of insensibility, a betrayal of trust. We say things we think we should say, but in reality we aren’t thinking at all. What message does flattery send? “You don’t matter enough for me to pay you much mind.”</p>
<p class="indent">We have to overcome the temptation to live on autopilot. Bestselling author Rick Warren writes:</p>
<p class="blockquote1">We rush out the door and say, “Hey, how are you doing? Nice to see you.” We don’t even look people in the eye. We’re not really talking to them. If you do that, you’re going to miss a lot of potential in other people. . . . People aren’t things to be molded, like clay. That’s not your job. That’s manipulation—not leadership. People aren’t things to be molded; they’re lives to be unfolded. And that’s what true leaders do. They unfold the lives of others and help them reach their God-given potential.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part01_ch02en5"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part01_ch02en5a">5</a></span></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_19"/>It is unreasonable to expect any of us to be on our A-game all of the time. Certainly we all miss opportunities we should have taken. But we can all measure our own scales over time. Do the messages you send with your written words, your spoken words, your presence, tip the scales toward affirmation or aloofness? The more they lean toward affirmation, the more influence you will gain with others.</p>
<p class="indent">Emerson wrote, “Every man is entitled to be valued for his best moments.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part01_ch02en6"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part01_ch02en6a">6</a></span> Think about that for a moment. Which relationship is most strained in your life right now? What would it look like if you began focusing on that person’s best moments and sought to affirm them? This doesn’t presuppose the person doesn’t have his faults. It doesn’t even presume he has fewer faults than fine qualities. He might be a broken man with years of waste and wrongdoing in his wake. But one thing you can be sure of: if you aim to influence him to change, repeatedly pointing out his rap sheet will do you little good. If instead you begin to remind him of what he could be—not with hypothetical hype, but with his own history of goodness, of success, of insight, even if only a brief history—something inside him would have cause to awaken. He could begin to see what he can still be, despite what he has been. “When we treat man as he is, we make him worse than he is; when we treat him as if he already were what he potentially could be, we make him what he should be.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part01_ch02en7"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part01_ch02en7a">7</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">Few in history have understood the power of affirming the good in others better than the sixteenth president of the United States. With this one idea Abraham Lincoln kept the nation together. When he took the oath of office in March 1861 it was far from certain that there would ever be another inaugural address for a U.S. president.</p>
<p class="indent">The same day he was sworn in, the Stars and Bars, the Confederacy’s new flag, was first raised over Montgomery, <a id="page_20"/>Alabama. In the months since Lincoln had been elected, seven states seceded from the Union. Everyone, friend and foe alike, wanted to know what this man had to say about the breakaway states.</p>
<p class="indent">History now views this as one of the greatest speeches ever given, precisely because Lincoln wrote with a spirit of reconciliation. He wasn’t weak—he warned about the consequences of any attack on the Union. But he had the vision to affirm what was good at a moment when almost no one else could: “We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies.”</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/common.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noindent2">What audacity this took. Seven states had already broken away and declared independence. War loomed. Friends? How could they possibly be seen as friends?</p>
<p class="indent">Consider the last time a coworker betrayed you, a client lied to you, or a vendor failed to deliver on a promise. Was your first reaction to remember what he had done that was still good and true?</p>
<p class="indent">Being disappointed, let down, or betrayed are among our most frustrating, maddening moments. Yet they also afford us rare moments to make a supreme impression.</p>
<p class="indent">Do you recall a time someone surprised you with undeserved grace or unconditional forgiveness? The occurrence might have taken place many years ago, even during your childhood. Yet the person is likely a permanent part of your memory, with the emotion you felt still tangible.</p>
<p class="indent">Ultimately, gaining influence is about setting yourself apart, stepping to a higher plane in the mind and heart of another. If all you do is act and react like anyone would, you will never be set apart. The reasons are simple.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_21"/>Competition for attention is constant. Communications are often a blur. It is challenging enough to become influential in today’s express-lane rat race. You need moments to show yourself altruistic and trustworthy, and seconds are all you are typically afforded. Were we all perfect individuals without a shortcoming in our lives, gaining influence through differentiation would fall solely on your ability to display a greater measure of trustworthiness than the others in a person’s sphere of influence. That’s a hard line to follow if your competition were all mistake-free individuals like yourself. In this scenario, competing for influence would look more like a beauty pageant (and some still treat it as such).</p>
<p class="indent">That’s not the case. We are all imperfect beings full of shortcomings, and this affords us perhaps as many opportunities to affirm others after disagreement or disappointment as in the midst of affability. The key is to allow yourself no claim on circumstantial exemptions—use a spirit of affirmation to convey your thoughts about others whenever you can.</p>
<p class="indent">Lest you make the mistake some do, a spirit of affirmation despite another’s faults is not a show of weakness or passivity. It is not a denial of justice, either, for mercy without justice is meaningless. Lincoln saw beyond the obvious and saw what might happen, and he pursued it.</p>
<p class="blockquote1">Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union.</p>
<p class="indent1">Sometimes affirming the good in others will mean reminding ourselves of that very good that exists in another. Yes, Lincoln <a id="page_22"/>said, things are strained, but the bonds of amity are stronger still. There was an American history the South and the North both shared. They’d declared independence together, built a nation together, endured war together, and all needed to be reminded of it: “When again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.”</p>
<p class="indent">Those final words are the summation of all that needed to be affirmed. There was something bigger than discord hidden deep within, a better and truer reality that needed permission to breathe.</p>
<p class="indent">From a British monarch to a divided young nation, an appeal to the good in others turned a tense situation into a compelling challenge to change. This is not, as some might be tempted to think, an action that ignores the problems between you and another. Rather, it addresses them head-on but in a respectful, dignifying manner that is far more successful at propelling another toward repentance, reconciliation, or improvement.</p>
<p class="indent">In <em>You Can’t Lead with Your Feet on the Desk,</em> Ed Fuller, president and managing director at Marriott International, asserts, “No worthwhile business relationship, whether with your own people or customers and partners, can endure without mutual respect. And as I’ve learned firsthand, showing adversaries that you regard them with admiration can resolve even violent conflicts.”</p>
<p class="indent">Fuller then tells the story of a brawl that broke out between a Marriott attorney and a hotel owner in South America when the renegotiation of a management agreement escalated into a shouting match, and the two grown men began wrestling in a hotel conference room. The struggle continued without the intervention of bystanders until the hotel owner’s revolver hopped out of its holster and bumped across the floor. The wrestlers were immediately pried apart with damaged egos and no resolution.</p>
<p class="indent">A few months passed without progress on the matter until <a id="page_23"/>a corporate lawyer and two company executives suggested the Marriott president pay the hotel owner a visit. Fuller describes the events that followed:</p>
<p class="blockquote1">I flew to his hometown and spent two days traveling with him, visiting his businesses, dining at his club, and mingling with his friends. As we got to know each other apart from our business dealings, our mutual respect grew. Seeing him in a different light allowed me to understand the strength of his commitment to his employees, family, and community. The differences at the heart of the conflict weren’t resolved, but I realized that he deserved my respect for who he was and what he had accomplished. A week after I left, we reached an agreement with the owner.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part01_ch02en8"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part01_ch02en8a">8</a></span></p>
<p class="indent1">Affirming what’s good, as with every principle in this book, is not just for grandly titled people at massive moments in human history. It is for this time and this age, where the spirit of communication is often less than dignifying. From the political podium to the digital medium to the boardroom table, the one who speaks in a spirit of respectful, unhyperbolic affirmation will always win more friends and influence more people to positive progress than the one who communicates in criticism, condemnation, and condescension.</p>
<p class="indent">The beauty of this principle today is that our affirmation of others is not limited to tangible interface. “While nothing can replace the effectiveness of your face-to-face interactions,” explained TOMS Shoes founder Blake Mycoskie in a recent interview, “it’s important to remember that the digital world can enhance relationship building.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part01_ch02en9"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part01_ch02en9a">9</a></span> At any moment of our day we can spread messages that affirm our friends, fans, and followers in numerous ways over email, Twitter, text, and blogs. <a id="page_24"/>Don’t, however, make the mistake of separating the scalability of a message from the individual significance of the message. They are inextricably linked. As big as a business gets, as large a following as one accumulates, messages are still given and received on an individual level.</p>
<p class="indent">What builds a bridge of influence between a king and his speech therapist is the same principle that builds a bridge of influence between a company and its customers or an executive and her reports or a father and his child.</p>
<p class="indent">We are all united by one single desire: to be valued by another. Whether this message is conveyed is not a group decision. Each individual to whom a message was directed—whether the individual sits alone across a table or in a crowd of three thousand—determines it.</p>
<p class="indent">In Carnegie’s original book he offered a story that has, perhaps more than any other story in its pages, struck a chord with millions of readers the world over. It was not his story. It belonged to a man named W. Livingston Larned, who called it “Father Forgets.”</p>
<p class="indent">Carnegie included it as an encouragement to all of us who can so easily forget ourselves and spend days critiquing and criticizing others. It is included here with a different perspective—not of the father who finally sees his mistakes but of the young son who with an unconditional spirit of affirmation wields a level of influence that changes his father forever.</p>
<p class="blockquote1">Listen, son: I am saying this as you lie asleep, one little paw crumpled under your cheek and the blond curls stickily wet on your damp forehead. I have stolen into your room alone. Just a few minutes ago, as I sat reading my paper in the library, a stifling wave of remorse swept over me. Guiltily I came to your bedside.</p>
<p class="blockquote2">These are the things I was thinking, son: I had been cross to <a id="page_25"/>you. I scolded you as you were dressing for school because you gave your face merely a dab with a towel. I took you to task for not cleaning your shoes. I called out angrily when you threw some of your things on the floor.</p>
<p class="blockquote2">At breakfast I found fault, too. You spilled things. You gulped down your food. You put your elbows on the table. You spread butter too thick on your bread. And as you started off to play and I made for my train, you turned and waved a hand and called, “Goodbye, Daddy!” and I frowned, and said in reply, “Hold your shoulders back!”</p>
<p class="blockquote2">Then it began all over again in the late afternoon. As I came up the road I spied you, down on your knees, playing marbles. There were holes in your stockings. I humiliated you before your boyfriends by marching you ahead of me to the house. Stockings were expensive—and if you had to buy them you would be more careful! Imagine that, son, from a father!</p>
<p class="blockquote2">Do you remember, later, when I was reading in the library, how you came in timidly, with a sort of hurt look in your eyes? When I glanced up over my paper, impatient at the interruption, you hesitated at the door. “What is it you want?” I snapped.</p>
<p class="blockquote2">You said nothing, but ran across in one tempestuous plunge, and threw your arms around my neck and kissed me, and your small arms tightened with an affection that God had set blooming in your heart and which even neglect could not wither. And then you were gone, pattering up the stairs.</p>
<p class="blockquote2">Well, son, it was shortly afterwards that my paper slipped from my hands and a terrible sickening fear came over me. What has habit been doing to me? The habit of finding fault, of reprimanding—this was my reward to you for being a boy. It was not that I did not love you; it was that I expected too much of youth. I was measuring you by the yardstick of my own years.</p>
<p class="blockquote2">And there was so much that was good and fine and true in <a id="page_26"/>your character. The little heart of you was as big as the dawn itself over the wide hills. This was shown by your spontaneous impulse to rush in and kiss me good night. Nothing else matters tonight, son. I have come to your bedside in the darkness, and I have knelt there, ashamed!</p>
<p class="blockquote2">It is a feeble atonement; I know you would not understand these things if I told them to you during your waking hours. But tomorrow I will be a real daddy! I will chum with you, and suffer when you suffer, and laugh when you laugh. I will bite my tongue when impatient words come. I will keep saying as if it were a ritual: “He is nothing but a boy—a little boy!”</p>
<p class="blockquote2">I am afraid I have visualized you as a man. Yet as I see you now, son, crumpled and weary in your cot, I see that you are still a baby. Yesterday you were in your mother’s arms, your head on her shoulder. I have asked too much, too much.</p>
<p class="indent1">Isn’t it profound the influence one is afforded—even the smallest among us—when affirmation comes clean off our tongue and clear from our hearts? All great progress and problem solving with others begins when at least one party is willing to place what is already good on the table. From there it is much easier to know where to begin and how to lead the interaction to a mutually beneficial end.</p>
