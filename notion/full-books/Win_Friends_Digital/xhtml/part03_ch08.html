<p class="paraspaceabove"><span class="big"><strong>W</strong></span>e all crave transcendence—to be part of something bigger than ourselves, to be meaningful to the world and the people within it, to have it said of us that we rose above, took a stand, reached beyond, and did what was right and honorable and true. Small boys long to be the strong warrior or the heroic prince of an imaginary kingdom. Small girls long to be the clever maiden or the captivating princess at the center of a grand adventure. At a foundational level, these same desires are a reason you hold this book in your hands.</p>
<p class="indent">While relational improvement and business productivity are centerpieces of our lives, their importance exists because we long to be people who make a difference. Tapping this noble motive in those you’d like to influence can therefore reap great rewards. And it is likely simpler than you think.</p>
<p class="indent">When the British newspaper and publishing magnate Lord Northcliffe found a newspaper using a picture of him that he didn’t want published, he wrote the editor a letter. He didn’t say, “Please do not publish that picture of me anymore; I don’t like it.” He appealed to a nobler motive: the respect and love that all of us have for motherhood. He asked that the picture not be published simply because his mother did not like it.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_154"/>When John D. Rockefeller Jr., wished to stop newspaper photographers from snapping pictures of his children, he too appealed to the nobler motives. He didn’t say, “I don’t want their pictures published.” He appealed to the desire, deep in all of us, to refrain from harming children. He said: “You know how it is, boys. You’ve got children yourselves, some of you. And you know it’s not good for youngsters to get too much publicity.”</p>
<p class="indent">Such an approach does more than just appeal to a noble motive in another; it assigns to that person a certain nobility. It conveys the message, “You are capable of doing the right, honorable, true thing.” It is a subtle compliment that essentially says, “I believe in you.” These are powerful words that move people to action, as a Dale Carnegie Training graduate named Sarah learned.</p>
<p class="indent">She and a friend were arranging a trip to Austria and Germany for a group of ten. They contacted a coach company to arrange a transfer from Austria to Europa Park in Rust, Germany. They received a quote of 965 euros for the transfer, which they agreed to and confirmed via email. One week before the transfer, Sarah received an email from Peter, an associate in the coach company, asking her which Rust she was planning to visit with the group. Peter told Sarah that if they were visiting the Rust in Austria it would cost 965 euros, but if it was the Rust in Germany it would cost 1,889 euros.</p>
<p class="indent">Naturally, Sarah was angry about the sudden change in price. She knew there was little time to arrange for another transfer at a reasonable cost. She was faced with a dilemma. Should she begin sending an angry litany of emails to Peter regarding how he changed his offer? Or was there another way to handle the problem?</p>
<p class="indent">Sarah determined that berating Peter would accomplish little and would still leave her stuck with the transfer problem. So <a id="page_155"/>she decided on a different approach. She would appeal to Peter’s noble motives and attempt to fix the problem through honest interaction.</p>
<p class="indent">She acted calmly. She replied to his email by asking him if there were two different Europa Parks in two different cities called Rust. Peter replied in the negative.</p>
<p class="indent">Sarah replied with another email, including a copy of his initial offer, and explained that she had clearly specified that the transfer was for Europa Park, Rust, Germany, and that, based on his reply, there was only one. She then concluded, “I kindly request an explanation for this change of pricing, as I am sure as a respectful company, you value your initial offers, and care about maintaining your credibility with your clients.”</p>
<p class="indent">Sarah received an apology from Peter the next day, explaining that there had been some confusion on their end. He then gladly confirmed the initial offer.</p>
<p class="indent">By appealing to Peter’s and his company’s nobler motives, Sarah was able to solve the problem without further financial or emotional cost.</p>
<p class="indent">Most of us do not recognize these noble desires in ourselves while we are children, but when we grow up we see them in our children and feel them well up inside of us when we watch films such as <em>The King’s Speech, Gladiator,</em> or <em>Little Women</em>. In some way we all want our everydayness to include heroic elements.</p>
<p class="indent">“What if ?” writes author and former marriage and family counselor John Eldredge, “What if those deep desires in our hearts are telling us the truth, revealing to us the life that we were <em>meant</em> to live.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch08en1"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch08en1a">1</a></span> Few would refute that there is something noble and redeemable in everyone.</p>
<p class="indent">All of us, being idealists at heart and preferring to present ourselves in the best light, like to think of motives that sound good. If we provide an opportunity for others to do the same, <a id="page_156"/>if we don’t assume that their motives are selfish or deceitful, we allow them to increase their own self-worth in their response to us. We allow them to prove us right about them.</p>
<p class="indent">Today’s advertisers are exceptionally good at applying this principle. Consider the campaigns for environmentally friendly products, Dove’s Campaign for Real Beauty, and other products that make either the buyer or the company seem nobler in motive. Nonprofit organizations also employ this tactic and use social media to propagate their messages in these ways. This works because most people will react favorably to your proposals if they feel that you admire them for being honest, unselfish, and fair.</p>
<p class="indent">One morning at breakfast, University of San Francisco business professor David Batstone learned that one of his favorite restaurants in the Bay Area was using slave labor. The newspaper article that exposed the atrocity detailed how the restaurant forced employees to work under harsh conditions by threatening to expose their status as illegal immigrants.</p>
<p class="indent">The story caught David off-guard and ignited a passion within him to start the Not for Sale Campaign, an organization that seeks, among other things, to expose modern-day slave labor in communities and companies across America.</p>
<p class="indent">To hear David speak about the campaign is to be compelled to join in. This is precisely what he wants to see happen. He knows the issue will touch everyone. The thought of slave labor in this day and age is appalling—it makes us indignant and ready to rise up to help.</p>
<p class="indent">In 2010 David and his team rolled out a new initiative called Free2Work. The program is actually an app for your smartphone. The consumer scans a product, and the app then produces a grade for the company that makes the product. If, for example, you want to buy a shirt from Patagonia, you can scan the item <a id="page_157"/>and the Free2Work app will give Patagonia a manufacturing grade indicating how well the company performs with regard to fair trade, employment, and overseas manufacturing.</p>
<p class="indent">The app provides a new level of accountability for manufacturing companies and a new level of responsibility for consumers. We can’t claim ignorance anymore for supporting companies that employ slave labor or fail to be transparent in their international manufacturing efforts.</p>
<p class="indent">On a deeper level, the app speaks directly to the noble motives of the companies involved. When held accountable for their business dealings and asked to meet a high and humane standard, companies tend to comply. They understand that consumers increasingly care about how products are made and how their companies treat the people they employ.</p>
<p class="indent">The Free2Work Campaign targets the noble motives of consumers and manufacturing companies to incite positive cultural change. How can you begin targeting the noble desires of your constituents and vendors in a way that will contribute to changing the ethos of a particular industry that may need new life, new standards?</p>
<p class="indent">This is an important question to answer today. The key to successful growth and positive impact inside and outside the marketplace is what digital maven Amy Martin calls “the business of humanity.” Her response to the 2011 tsunami in Japan exemplifies the power of appealing to noble motives in the digital age.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch08en2"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch08en2a">2</a></span> It also serves as a candid reminder of the consequences of not embodying this principle.</p>
<p class="indent">During a late-night workout on an elliptical machine, Martin was perusing others’ Twitter updates on her iPad. The earthquake and subsequent tsunami hit in Japan, and suddenly the Twittersphere was inundated with the news. She flipped to CNN on the television and caught live footage of vehicles being <a id="page_158"/>washed away and people frantically trying to outrun the crushing tide coming ashore. “I wasn’t sure what to do,” she blogged, “but I felt accountable and compelled to help in some way.”</p>
<p class="indent">She began sifting through the most relevant tweets and links and redistributing them to her large following. She also asked her followers to send her any valuable information they had that she could broadcast to others. For four hours she continued, and none of it had anything to do with marketing or promoting products. It was about “people coming together through a virtual medium to help each other,” she wrote. “It was the business of humanity.”</p>
<p class="indent">Still, during her humanitarian efforts she witnessed an alarming contrast—large television news outlets seemingly crippled by an ill-timed concern for ratings. While she was in the midst of the digital effort, certain prominent news channels toggled back and forth between dramatic footage of the catastrophe and the latest celebrity spectacle.</p>
<p class="indent">“I was aghast,” she wrote. “In my opinion, if these news organizations are in the least concerned about the way the public perceives their brand then they should exercise more discernment and care more about saving lives than the Hollywood beat. . . . Sometimes you need to put [Hollywood] in the backseat and focus on the right thing to do.”</p>
<p class="indent">Martin clarifies something that is easy to forget amid the push to transactional effect. The many social media channels to which we are privy are first and foremost interpersonal communication tools designed for humans to connect. “They weren’t invented,” she notes,“for marketers.”</p>
<p class="indent">Many of Martin’s followers echoed the sentiment in her blog post and appreciated her appeal to the noble motives not only in the large news organizations but also in all who had the capacity to help those suffering in the wake of the tsunami. While Martin <a id="page_159"/>was selling nothing that night, it is no wonder 1.3 million people follow her on Twitter and some of the most prominent businesses, celebrities, and professional sports teams call on her for digital guidance. She is one who knows that doing business in the digital age is predicated on doing the business of humanity well.</p>
<p class="indent">So often we are content to simply plug others into our digital world and browse them like commodities until we are ready to engage in some sort of transaction. Such sentiment removes the nobility inherent in our shared humanity. It makes our relationships merely tools of transaction rather than transcendence.</p>
<p class="indent">To truly connect with people you must celebrate their inherent dignity. In doing so you celebrate yours. Appeal to noble motives and you can move the masses, and yourself along with them.<a id="page_160"/></p>
