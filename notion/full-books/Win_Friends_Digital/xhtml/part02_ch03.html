<p class="paraspaceabove"><span class="big"><strong>O</strong></span>n March 10, 2010, a press release skittered through the wires at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart Oliver &amp; Hedges, one of <em>American Lawyer</em>’s top 100 law firms. John Quinn and Eric Emanuel, who founded the company twenty-five years earlier, were naming a new partner—Kathleen M. Sullivan.</p>
<p class="indent">Sullivan, one of the nation’s top litigators and former dean of Stanford Law School, had been credentialed at Cornell, Harvard Law, and Oxford. She’d been First Lady Michelle Obama’s professor at Harvard, and praise for her legal mind, acumen, and talent was universal. Her adversaries knew how tough a legal foe she was. Her appointment was well deserved.</p>
<p class="indent">Law firms, like all companies, make changes to their businesses from time to time. Associates come and go, paralegals and assistants as well. Partner turnover is much rarer, but it is hardly uncommon.</p>
<p class="indent">Why was this particular appointment so significant?</p>
<p class="indent">Kathleen Sullivan was not just named a partner; she became a named partner. The new firm would henceforth be called Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &amp; Sullivan. To be a named partner in a law firm is especially significant, all the more at a prestigious firm. <a id="page_62"/>But what put Sullivan’s appointment into rare air was that she immediately became the first woman ever to be a named partner at one of America’s top 100 law firms.</p>
<p class="indent">From 1870, when Ada H. Kepley became the first woman to graduate from a law school, to 2010, no other top firm had made space on its door for a woman’s name. But no more. A name was embraced and a barrier broken.</p>
<p class="indent">Quinn wrote, “Her inclusion in the firm’s name reflects the integration of our trial and appellate practices and our strengths as a national law firm.” There is power in a person’s name. More than a word, it is a verbal symbol of something much deeper and more meaningful. This is not just the case for groundbreakers such as Kathleen Sullivan.</p>
<p class="indent">From ancient to modern literature, a person’s name was not merely a moniker; it was a revelation of character, personality, and fate. Apollo, Abraham, and Atticus; Cosette, Scarlett, Cinderella, and Pollyanna. In Roman times, a name was so closely identified with who a person was that when a criminal’s name was removed from the civic register, all the rights of citizenship vanished. To this day certain tribes in Africa believe an individual’s given name is the primary force that determines his or her skills, decisions, and ultimately life’s destiny.</p>
<p class="indent">Is there any reason to believe a person’s name is any less important today? It is perhaps more so, but it has become primarily the case in a commercial context. This represents opportunities and problems.</p>
<p class="indent">In the digital age, names are like company logos, identifying not only who one is but also what one represents—likes and dislikes, yeas and nays. The hundreds of millions of bloggers, tweeters, and Facebookers surely want their voices heard, but they also want their names known. Twitter and Facebook in particular have done more than simply add to an information-based <a id="page_63"/>economy; they have also created a new kind of name-based economy in which we are largely known by the name we brand and campaign to the world. This sort of recognition can now be monetized, of course, giving new meaning to the phrase “household name.”</p>
<p class="indent">On Twitter and blogs, your commercial worth is commensurate with the number of names following you. As your following grows, publishing contracts, advertising agreements, and endorsement deals increase not only in viability but also in value. Technorati Top 100 blogger Ree Drummond is a great example.</p>
<p class="indent">A University of California, Los Angeles, graduate with big plans to practice law in a big city, she met and married her “Marlboro Man” husband while on a “pit stop” in Oklahoma, as she put it. Plans for law school in Chicago went out the window, and she moved to her husband’s fourth-generation cattle ranch and took on her new moniker, “Pioneer Woman.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch03en1"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch03en1a">1</a></span> Drummond began blogging in 2006 as a way to keep friends and family apprised of her unexpected but gratifying life. By 2009 she had approximately two million readers and site traffic in the eight-figure range monthly. By 2010 she had two lucrative book contracts and two subsequent <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers, and she was earning approximately $1 million a year from blog ad sales alone.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch03en2"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch03en2a">2</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">It is clear that our own names can hold value today, but lest we be tempted to forget, knowing others’ names can lead to greater success. Dave Munson, founder of the Saddleback Leather Company, knows this well. He was a volunteer English teacher in Mexico when he had his first leather bag made from a design he drew for a local leatherworker. The bag garnered so much attention on his hometown streets of Portland, Oregon, he decided to return to Mexico immediately and have more made. A month later Munson returned to Portland with eight bags in tow <a id="page_64"/>and sold them all from the safari rack of his old Land Cruiser in three hours. The Saddleback Leather Company was born, and with it the goal “to love people around the world by making excessively high quality, tough and functional leather designs.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch03en3"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch03en3a">3</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">His secret? Munson frequently fields customer calls from his cell phone and returns online questions via phone or email; he also travels to Mexico multiple times each year to stay connected with the Mexican leatherworkers still making his bags. The visits aren’t showmanship. “I hug the workers and ask them how I can pray for them,” he explained in a recent interview. “When I first started taking the trips I remember how shocked these men were that I would call them by name and then sit down and talk to them about their personal lives. One got tears in his eyes. Then so did I.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch03en4"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch03en4a">4</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">He doesn’t share these personal stories on his blog or in his marketing literature because he believes promising to do something is different from simply producing it. Saddleback is proud, he says, to remain a family business despite selling millions of dollars’ worth of leather goods each year. “I’ve heard horror stories of lots of small and successful businesses who, driven by greed, try to become giants and fail,” Munson writes on his blog. “We aren’t like that. We are and will maintain our family of leather owners with love. Pretty much everyday I lay down in bed with my hot wife and we talk about different bag owners who we’ve been going back and forth with. We want to know your name.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch03en5"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch03en5a">5</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">It is this level of personal touch—putting people’s names before product names and profits—that makes one surmise Saddleback Leather will be around as long as one of his leather bags, which carries the tagline “They’ll fight over it when you’re dead.”</p>
<p class="indent">The opportunities to be known by others and to know others are ultimately two sides of the same coin. There is <a id="page_65"/>branding—the introduction of you to others. And then there is relationship building—the interaction between you and others. What is interesting is that you can forgo the former and still be successful. You can be so good at building relationships that your interactions with others birth and sustain your brand. Conversely, you cannot sustain success on branding alone. You cannot brand yourself or your business and then forgo building relationships. In the end, business is still about one person relating to another. Mr. Bates from Watkinsville, Georgia, experienced this firsthand.</p>
<p class="indent">He is a business owner who always takes his top out-of-town suppliers to Bone’s, a famous Atlanta restaurant some seventy miles away. His loyalty, however, wasn’t born of their exquisite menu, branded as well as any in North America. It started with a waiter named James.</p>
<p class="indent">As Mr. Bates and a supplier pulled up to their table one evening, James approached promptly. “Hello, Mr. Bates,” he said. “Thank you for choosing Bone’s. It is a pleasure to have you back.”</p>
<p class="indent">To hear Mr. Bates describe it, it was no insignificant moment. “It changed the dining experience and imprinted that restaurant in my mind. I’d only dined there once before—six months earlier—and James not only knew my name, he took the time to discover I’d been there before. I was by no means a regular, but the small gesture made me feel like one. It was the old adage about ‘treating someone like the person you want him to become’ coming true.”</p>
<p class="indent">For such a small gesture it paid big dividends. “I don’t take my suppliers anywhere else now,” said Mr. Bates. Judging by the popularity of Bone’s, it would seem many customers share his sentiment.</p>
<p class="indent">This is the primary business payoff of remembering people’s names: they remember you. The flipside is an unenviable place to be.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_66"/>One of the first lessons a politician learns is this: “To recall a voter’s name is statesmanship. To forget is oblivion.” It is one trait that unites most of history’s great leaders. From Lincoln to Churchill to Bonaparte, these men figured out ways to remember people’s names with surprising consistency. In so doing, they recalled, knowingly or not, a famous Emerson saying: “Good manners are made up of petty sacrifices.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch03en6"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch03en6a">6</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">When it comes to remembering names, some sacrifices may be required. Napoleon III, emperor of France and nephew of the great Napoleon Bonaparte, claimed he could remember the name of every person he met despite all of his royal duties.</p>
<p class="indent">How? If he didn’t hear the name distinctly, he said, “So sorry. I didn’t get the name clearly.” Then, if it was an unusual name, he would say, “How is it spelled?”</p>
<p class="indent">During the conversation, he took the trouble to repeat the name several times and tried to associate it in his mind with the person’s features, expression, and general appearance. If the person was of special importance to him, he later wrote the name down on a piece of paper, looked at it, concentrated on it, fixed it securely in his mind, and then tore up the paper. In this way, he gained a visual impression of the name as well as an audible impression.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch03en7"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch03en7a">7</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">Our challenges today are far greater than Napoleon’s. Numerous studies show that the only thing worse than television for our attention span is the Internet. A blur of 140-word tweets, Facebook news feeds, emails, instant messages, and web pages are beginning to rewire our brains.</p>
<p class="indent">In a May 2010 issue of <em>Wired,</em> author Nicholas Carr revealed that a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, had discovered that just five hours on the Internet rerouted people’s neural pathways. Carr noted:</p>
<p class="blockquote1"><a id="page_67"/>Dozens of studies by psychologists, neurobiologists, and educators point to the same conclusion: When we go online, we enter an environment that promotes cursory reading, hurried and distracted thinking, and superficial learning. Even as the Internet grants us easy access to vast amounts of information, it is turning us into shallower thinkers, literally changing the structure of our brain.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch03en8"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch03en8a">8</a></span></p>
<p class="indent1">In 2010 famed film critic Roger Ebert blogged, “There’s such a skitterish impatience in our society right now.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch03en9"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch03en9a">9</a></span> He’s right. But such reality doesn’t give us an excuse for forgetting people’s names. Instead, it provides us with a challenge. As more and more people find it more and more difficult to remember names, there is enormous advantage to be gained by those who do.</p>
<p class="indent">How?</p>
<p class="indent">There are some easy ways. Instead of defaulting to hollow, truncated greetings such as “Hey” or “Hi,” default to a greeting that uses the person’s name: “Dear Robin” or “Good morning, Robert.” When you do, practice Napoleon’s technique and visualize the person’s face. If you’ve taken the advice of earlier chapters and sought to take interest in the person’s interests, impress your mind with those as well. “Robert is married with three daughters and he likes reading Ernest Hemingway.” It’s a simple exercise that will not only help you greet Robert by name the next time you interact; it will also go a long way to helping you consistently view him outside a mere transactional context.</p>
<p class="indent">A quick tip here: Before you use people’s names, make sure you know them in the right context. Today most people have more than one name to which they answer. Celebrated entrepreneur Richard Branson is “Richard” to many friends, but he is also “Mr. Branson” to many acquaintances and “Sir Richard” to many fellow Brits. While we are a far less formal society at large, using a <a id="page_68"/>person’s name out of context is a good way to get a relationship off on the wrong foot. Susan or Suzie? Ben or Benjamin? Jacqueline or Jackie? The best advice is to avoid guessing.</p>
<p class="indent">Don’t call Richard “Richie,” “Rich” or “Dick” in an email unless he’s been introduced as such, he’s asked you to use that name, or he’s referred to himself with that name in a voice mail, text message, or email to you. If you’ve not been introduced and have never corresponded, do a little homework on what people in your same relational position are calling him. Don’t check to see what his Facebook or Twitter friends call him—at this point you’re not yet his friend and have not earned the right to call him a more casual name. Instead, review how he refers to himself on his website or blog. If there is an article written about him or in which he is referenced, use that name.</p>
<p class="indent">We must remember that a person is more interested in his or her own name than in all the other names on earth put together. Remember that name and use it easily, and you have paid a subtle and very effective compliment. But forget it or misspell it, and you have placed yourself at a sharp disadvantage.</p>
<p class="indent">While many choose the safer alternative and address a person with terms such as “man,” “ma’am,” and “sir,” you can place yourself in the same person’s better graces by taking the time to not only remember but also use his or her name. Many of the salutation pitfalls we fear are easily avoidable with a few minutes’ worth of research. Aren’t a few minutes of your time worth it if it means standing out from the crowd, if it means making a better impression than most people make on others?</p>
<p class="indent">If you want others to remember and use your name, the small investment is necessary. People have names coming at them in all forms all day long—people’s names, company names, brand names, street names, and store names. What will set yours apart? Largely, the emotions people associate with your name. If you’re <a id="page_69"/>just another waiter in just another restaurant in Atlanta—a metropolitan area of more than five million people—you will be no more memorable than the numbers on your license plate or the color of your shirt. Your name will do little to trigger emotions that connect others to you. It is no coincidence that Mr. Bates easily remembered James’s name after only one encounter. He estimates he dines out about twelve times a month. When asked if he remembers other waiters’ names, he replied, “I barely remember my own some days.”</p>
<p class="indent">We should always be aware of the magic contained in a person’s name and realize that this word is wholly and completely owned by the person with whom we are dealing, and nobody else. It is a person’s trademark. After the gift of life, a person’s name is the first gift he or she received. When this word is used in conversation, the information we are discussing or the connection we are seeking takes on greater meaning.</p>
<p class="indent">Perhaps a doctor’s office provides the best evidence. There is an ongoing debate in the medical world about how and when first names should be used. Does a first-name basis overpersonalize interactions that are best kept in a professional realm? Or would a first-name basis help in the process of health and healing and particularly in the process of discussing very difficult prognoses?</p>
<p class="indent">It would seem that most doctors believe professionalism is important and first names are best kept at bay. Yet doctors’ offices are typically places where patients feel dehumanized. They are folders and cases, not faces and feelings. Their names are frequently mispronounced or mistaken altogether, only serving to highlight a potentially dangerous disconnection.</p>
<p class="indent">One high-profile doctor decided to buck the trend.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch03en10"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch03en10a">10</a></span> Dr. Howard Fine is the head of the neuro-oncology program at the National Institutes of Health. In that capacity he performs original research, oversees and distributes all of NIH’s funding, <a id="page_70"/>and is the hands-on doctor for as many brain cancer patients as want to see him—free of charge, since it is a government program.</p>
<p class="indent">When patients arrive to see him for the first time, they are largely hopeless. They’ve seen the statistics on the Internet. They’ve heard horror stories. Dr. Fine views part of his job as restoring hope—responsible hope. How he handles names plays a leading role in this process.</p>
<p class="indent">He estimates he’s seen more than twenty thousand patients over the years, and one of the ways he has chosen to interact is by introducing himself as “Howard Fine,” without the doctor designation. From there his patients are encouraged to call him by his first name. It takes the relationship to another level, whereby he is no longer a detached doctor trying to keep them from dying; he is a highly educated friend, wise confidant, and fierce advocate who will fight for their full recovery. He is not in the business of blowing smoke. Instead, he understands that because the sharing of facts is both important and poignant for his patients, the establishment of rapport is essential for their well-being. What brain tumor patients need more than a doctor is a trusted advisor who understands. This is achieved more naturally when the doctor puts himself on the same level of his patients, a fellow human with a strong desire to live.</p>
<p class="indent">It would be easy for a prominent physician to find power in the “Dr.” moniker. But a big part of what makes Fine’s program the crown jewel of the National Institutes of Health, according to one of the institute’s heads, is that he recognizes that first names are more powerful and purposeful than detached ranks or bestowed titles. It is why Carnegie insisted names are “the sweetest and most important sound in any language.”</p>
