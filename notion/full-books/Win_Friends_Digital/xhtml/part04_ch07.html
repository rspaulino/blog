<p class="paraspaceabove"><span class="big"><strong>B</strong></span>enjamin Zander was tired—tired of watching his conservatory students, so anxious about the grading of their performances in his class, take a safe approach to their music education. In the top tiers of the arts world, bitter competition can define the talent development process. He considered abandoning grades altogether, but that presented a host of challenges, not the least of which was getting the head of the school to approve such a radical move.</p>
<p class="indent">Instead, he decided he would give each student an A—on the very first day of class.</p>
<p class="indent">Upon meeting his new and nervous students, he would say, “Each student in this class will get an A for the course. However, there is one requirement that you must fulfill to earn this grade: Some time during the next two weeks, you must write me a letter dated next May . . . and in this letter you are to tell, in as much detail as you can, the story of what will have happened to you by next May that is in line with this extraordinary grade.”</p>
<p class="indent">He instructed the students to think of themselves in the future, <a id="page_216"/>looking back on all that they had done to earn such an illustrious grade. They were to discuss insights, milestones, and even competitions won. But Zander wanted more than a surface analysis. “I am especially interested in the person you will have become by next May. I am interested in the attitude, feelings, and worldview of that person who will have done all she wished to do or become everything he wanted to be,” he would say to them.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part04_ch07en1"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part04_ch07en1a">1</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">What did he get from his students? Consider the following letter from a young trombonist:</p>
<p class="blockquote1"><em>Dear Mr. Z:</em></p>
<p class="blockquote2"><em>Today the world knows me. That drive of energy and intense emotion that you saw twisting and dormant inside me, yet, alas, I could not show in performance or conversation, was freed tonight in a program of new music composed for me. . . . The concert ended and no one stirred. A pregnant quiet. Sighs: and then applause that drowned my heart’s throbbing.</em></p>
<p class="blockquote2"><em>I might have bowed—I cannot remember now. The clapping sustained such that I thought I might make my debut complete and celebrate the shedding of</em></p>
<p class="blockquote1"><em>the mask and skin<br/>that I had constructed<br/>to hide within<br/>by improvising on my own melody as an<br/>encore—unaccompanied. What followed is<br/>something of a blur. I forgot technique,<br/>pretension, tradition, schooling, history—<br/>truly even the audience.</em><br/><em>What came from my trombone<br/>I wholly believe, was my own</em><br/><a id="page_217"/><em>Voice.</em><br/><em>Laughter, smiles,<br/>a frown, weeping<br/>Tuckerspirit<br/>did sing.</em></p>
<p class="blockquote1"><em>—Tucker Dulin</em></p>
<p class="indent1">Over the ten months of his course, Zander watched his students transform themselves in astounding ways. He calls his approach “giving an A.” In his book <em>The Art of Possibility,</em> coauthored with his wife, Rosamund Stone Zander, he has this to say about its potential to foster greatness in an individual:</p>
<p class="blockquote1">An A can be given to anyone in any walk of life—to a waitress, to your employer, to your mother-in-law, to the members of the opposite team, and to the other drivers in traffic. When you give an A, you find yourself speaking to people not from a place of measuring how they stack up against your standards, but from a place of respect that gives them room to realize themselves. . . . This A is not an expectation to live up to, but a possibility to live into.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part04_ch07en2"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part04_ch07en2a">2</a></span></p>
<p class="indent1">What a magical perspective to assume in an often cynical world.</p>
<p class="indent">Coaches, mentors, leaders, and parents often find that people live up to our expectations of them, no matter how diminished those expectations are. If a man feels unimportant or disrespected, he will have little motivation for improving himself. So why not create a vision of him that embodies everything you know he is capable of achieving, as well as everything you don’t know about his possibilities? You will rarely be disappointed.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_218"/>Paige Ann Michelle McCabe’s mother described her own adventures in creating a big-girl reputation for her daughter:</p>
<p class="blockquote1">Four-year-old Paige Ann Michelle McCabe was sitting on one of our kitchen stools when she heard me tell her six-year-old brother, Brandon, that it was now his responsibility to set the table each night before dinner. Paige looked hopeful and almost teary. “What am I big enough to do now, Mummy? What can I do ’cause I’m big too?” Not wanting to break her little heart or deflate her ego, I searched quickly for something that she could take responsibility for.</p>
<p class="blockquote2">An idea crept into my head just in time. “Paige Ann Michelle,” I announced triumphantly, “now that you are four years old, and old enough to make proper choices, you are responsible for choosing your clothes for the next day. Each night before you take a bath, you should get your clothes out of your drawer, and put them on the bed ready to wear in the morning when you wake up.”</p>
<p class="blockquote2">The house was a flurry of activity. Brandon was zooming around setting the table, and Paige ran straight to her room, where I could hear drawers and cupboards hurriedly opening and closing. About ten seconds later she ran out to report her success. “Look, Mummy, I did it, I got them out! Come and see, come and see!” Sure enough, the clothes were laid out on the bed, ready to go. I told her how proud I was, now that she was growing up and had her very own job to do, and she beamed.</p>
<p class="blockquote2">The next morning, a miracle occurred in the McCabe house.</p>
<p class="blockquote2">Usually, Mummy has to coax a grumpy Paige out of bed, and getting her dressed is difficult, to say the least. If I choose a blue skirt, she wants to wear red pants. If I choose a white shirt with butterflies, she wants to wear the purple shirt with flowers <a id="page_219"/>on it. Finally when I give in and tell her to choose, she takes forever. Paige stays grumpy and I end up frustrated.</p>
<p class="blockquote2">But not that morning. “Look what I am wearing, Mummy!” she said. She had got herself dressed before I had asked her to! I kissed her proudly and told her how happy I was with her choices. It was morning and Paige Ann Michelle McCabe was happy. What a difference that made!</p>
<p class="indent1">Paige Ann Michelle McCabe had lived up to the fine reputation of a grown-up four-year-old that had been bestowed upon her.</p>
<p class="indent">To change somebody’s behavior, change the level of respect she receives by giving her a fine reputation to live up to. Act as though the trait you are trying to influence is already one of the person’s outstanding characteristics.<a id="page_220"/></p>
