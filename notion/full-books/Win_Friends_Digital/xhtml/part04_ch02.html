<p class="paraspaceabove"><span class="big"><strong>B</strong></span>eth was a high-level executive in a Fortune 100 company. While much loved by her bosses and her team, she was in the throes of battle with a colleague, Harvey, who headed up another division. All’s fair in love and war, right? Well, Beth was living by that motto, revealing her most vindictive side in their interactions.</p>
<p class="indent">But Beth wanted to be a better leader, and so she enlisted the aid of Marshall Goldsmith, executive coach and author of <em>What Got You Here Won’t Get You There</em>. What she learned is that while she was respected by many, her behavior with Harvey was still affecting her reputation. She needed to negotiate a peace agreement with Harvey, and to do so, she had to admit fault.</p>
<p class="indent">This might be one of the hardest situations in which to follow this approach—one in which you have to acknowledge your mistakes to the person those mistakes have harmed. Tensions on both sides are already high, competition may be a driving factor, and you may feel it isn’t safe to make yourself vulnerable. Yet these are also the situations that can be most effectively defused by talking about your own mistakes first.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_184"/>So what did Beth say?</p>
<p class="indent">“You know, Harvey, I’ve got a lot of feedback here, and the first thing I want to say is that I’m positive about a lot of it. The next thing I want to say is that there are some things at which I want to be better. I’ve been disrespectful to you, the company, and the traditions in the company. Please accept my apologies. There is no excuse for this behavior.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part04_ch02en1"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part04_ch02en1a">1</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">Harvey’s response? He got tears in his eyes, admitted that he too had behaved dishonorably, and declared that together they would improve.</p>
<p class="indent">A lengthy, embittered turf war ended simply by proclaiming the mistakes she had made.</p>
<p class="indent">It isn’t nearly so difficult to be open to a conversation that may include a discussion of your faults if the other person begins by humbly admitting that she too is far from impeccable. Admitting one’s mistakes—even when one hasn’t corrected them—can help convince somebody to change his behavior.</p>
<p class="indent">Carnegie, the ever-effective communicator, applied this same lesson when writing on it. He began the discussion with a story of how he had failed as a mentor and coach to help readers become open to the idea. It’s a subtle and masterly strategy—and proof that it can be effective in many forms.</p>
<p class="indent">The difficulty that leaders face in implementing this strategy rests on one critical element: you must admit that you have made mistakes, that you are fallible. Leaders across the globe struggle with this, even though most understand inherently the value of it. And if they don’t understand it inherently, research certainly supports it.</p>
<p class="indent">Researchers at the Institute for Health and Human Potential conducted a study of thirty-five thousand people on the factors in career advancement. The item found to be most linked to career advancement? Freely admitting to making mistakes.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part04_ch02en2"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part04_ch02en2a">2</a></span></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_185"/>Admitting you have made a mistake is like the first step in a twelve-step program: it is both the hardest and the most important. Until we accept accountability, how can we learn from our mistakes, use them to propel us forward, and encourage others to trust us? “To leave the road of continual failure, a person must first utter the three most difficult words to say: ‘I was wrong.’ He has to open his eyes, admit his mistakes, and accept complete responsibility for his current wrong actions and attitudes.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part04_ch02en3"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part04_ch02en3a">3</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">Portia Nelson poetically describes this process in her “Autobiography in Five Short Chapters.” What begins in many of our first chapters as a pit of despair progresses only to detachment from the problem until we are able to accept responsibility for our faults. Once we see the link between where we are and what we do, only then do we begin to see quicker solutions to our problems; only then do we begin to walk around the deep holes in our path altogether. Eventually we learn we can simply walk down a less problematic path. That is to say, we move from merely being proficient problem solvers to behaving more proficiently.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part04_ch02en4"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part04_ch02en4a">4</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">Aside from the personal gains of admitting our mistakes, the trust it builds with our colleagues and customers, our friends and families, and our community members is invaluable. Marshall Goldsmith writes, “No one expects us to be right all the time. But when we’re wrong, they certainly expect us to own up to it. In that sense, being wrong is an opportunity—an opportunity to show what kind of person and leader we are. . . . How well you own up to your mistakes makes a bigger impression than how you revel in your successes.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part04_ch02en5"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part04_ch02en5a">5</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">When we talk about our mistakes, it makes us human. It becomes easier for people to relate to us. They feel we understand their perspective better. And in this mental space, they are more open to our advice.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_186"/>What is lovely about this principle is that we all make mistakes and so have an ample supply of stories to use when trying to put someone at ease. Remember to follow the story with constructive advice, not straight-up criticism.</p>
<p class="indent">How did Carnegie use the principle with his niece and new assistant, Josephine? By considering her lack of experience and his own blunders at her age and experience level.</p>
<p class="indent">“You have made a mistake, Josephine,” he would begin, “but Lord knows, it’s no worse than many I have made. Judgment comes only with experience, and you are better than I was at your age. I have been guilty of so many silly things myself I have very little inclination to criticize you or anyone. But don’t you think it would have been wiser if you had done so-and-so?”</p>
<p class="indent">By admitting your own mistakes, you direct the other person’s attention away from his own; you soften the approach and avoid raising his defenses immediately.</p>
<p class="indent">When you acknowledge your baggage, trust builds naturally.</p>
