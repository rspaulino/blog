<p class="paraspaceabove"><span class="big"><strong>G</strong></span>etting people to agree about virtually anything is practically impossible. Take Neil Armstrong’s 1969 romp across the moon. In the United Kingdom only 75 percent of people believe it actually happened.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch02en1"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch02en1a">1</a></span> Only 94 percent of Americans believe it happened.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch02en2"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch02en2a">2</a></span> In countries such as Mexico, China, and Indonesia, fewer than a third of respondents believe al Qaeda had anything to do with the 9/11 attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C. In the United States 16 percent of people believe it was planted explosives rather than burning passenger jets that brought down the twin towers of the World Trade Center.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch02en3"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch02en3a">3</a></span> About half of citizens in the European Union believe in God.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch02en4"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch02en4a">4</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">There is one thing that does unite us, however. According to the American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry, 99.7 percent of adults believe a smile is an important social asset.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch02en5"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch02en5a">5</a></span> It’s a difficult statistic to refute, even if you aren’t in the business of perfecting smiles.</p>
<p class="indent">We gravitate to grins and giggles. Consider the all-time most viewed videos on YouTube. The top two are all about smiles. In the most viewed, from the United Kingdom, Harry, a three-year-old boy, and his one-year-old brother, Charlie, are playing for the camera when Charlie grabs one of Harry’s fingers and shoves it <a id="page_52"/>in his mouth. A moment later he chomps down and Harry yelps in displeasure, retrieving his finger. All the while, Charlie smiles. That smile eventually wins as Harry’s smile returns and giggles ensue.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch02en6"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch02en6a">6</a></span> The other video is from Sweden. In it a baby boy smiles, giggles, and laughs in response to his parents’ silly sounds. It is nearly two minutes of face-cramp-inducing smiles.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch02en7"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch02en7a">7</a></span> A combined half a billion views tell us all we need to know. Smiles send a message we like to receive.</p>
<p class="indent">Smiling is innate, says Daniel McNeill, author of <em>The Face: A Natural History</em>. Some sort of smile, he writes, first appears two to twelve hours after birth. No one knows whether these smiles have any content—McNeill suspects they do not—but studies show they are crucial to bonding. What no one can debate, however, is the power of a smile no matter its origin.</p>
<p class="indent">McNeill notes that while “courtroom judges are equally likely to find smilers and nonsmilers guilty, they give smilers lighter penalties, a phenomenon called the ‘smile-leniency effect.’”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch02en8"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch02en8a">8</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">Smiles also have a proliferation effect. Nicholas Christakis, a physician and sociologist at Harvard, and James Fowler, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego, with special expertise in social networks, published a paper in the <em>British Medical Journal</em> in 2008, entitled “Dynamic Spread of Happiness in a Large Social Network.” They knew emotions could spread over short periods of time from person to person, in a process known as “emotional contagion.” But what they wanted to know was just how widely and sustainably happiness spread in social networks.</p>
<p class="indent">They followed 4,739 people from 1983 to 2003. These individuals were embedded in a larger network of 12,067 people, each having an average of eleven connections to others (including friends, family, coworkers, and neighbors), and their happiness was assessed every few years using a standard measure.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_53"/>The researchers’ findings confirmed the impact of a happy person, which smiling conveys directly. Social networks, they concluded,</p>
<p class="blockquote1">have clusters of happy and unhappy people within them that reach out to three degrees of separation. A person’s happiness is related to the happiness of their friends, their friends’ friends, and their friends’ friends’ friends—that is, to people well beyond their social horizon. We found that happy people tend to be located in the center of their social networks and to be located in large clusters of other happy people. And we found that each additional happy friend increases a person’s probability of being happy by about 9%. For comparison, having an extra $5,000 in income (in 1984 dollars) increased the probability of being happy by about 2%. Happiness, in short, is not merely a function of personal experience, but also is a property of groups.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch02en9"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch02en9a">9</a></span></p>
<p class="indent1">But what of life since 2003? Do our more prominent and ever-present digital walls filter out emotions rather than encourage them? Can happiness still spread in a world of bits and bytes? The answer, they found, is yes—if we can see that people are smiling.</p>
<p class="indent">Christakis and Fowler followed up their first study by looking at a group of 1,700 college students interconnected by Facebook. They reviewed their online profiles, determined their closest friends, and this time studied everyone’s photographs, noting those who were smiling in the photos and those who were not. They then mapped the pictures based on who was smiling and who was not. Each student was represented by a node and each line between two nodes indicated that the connected individuals were tagged in a photo together. Students who are smiling (and <a id="page_54"/>surrounded by smiling people in their network) were colored yellow. Students who were frowning (and surrounded by the same countenance) were colored blue. And finally, green nodes indicated a mix of smiling and non-smiling friends.</p>
<p class="indent">The map showed in vivid fashion how strongly the yellow nodes (smilers) and blue nodes (frowners) clustered together, with the yellow clusters proving to be much larger and more populated than the blues. Additionally, the nonsmilers seemed to be “located more peripherally in the network,” primarily on the outskirts of the map.</p>
<p class="indent">This came as no surprise to Christakis and Fowler, who noted,</p>
<p class="blockquote1">Statistical analysis of the network shows that people who smile tend to have more friends (smiling gets you an average of one extra friend, which is pretty good considering that people only have about six close friends). Not only that, but the statistical analyses confirm that those who smile are measurably more central to the network compared to those who do not smile. That is, if you smile, you are less likely to be on the periphery of the online world.</p>
<p class="indent1">In their final thoughts after noting the large and frequent number of node clusters surrounding smiling people, and the remote and peripherally peppered nodes of frowning people, they wrote, “It thus seems to be the case, online as well as offline, that when you smile, the world smiles with you.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch02en10"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch02en10a">10</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">There is a simple reason for this phenomenon: when we smile, we are letting people know we are happy to be with them, happy to meet them, happy to be interacting with them. They in turn feel happier to be dealing with us. To someone who has seen a dozen people frown, scowl, or turn their faces away, your smile is <a id="page_55"/>like the sun breaking through the clouds. Your smile is often the first messenger of your goodwill.</p>
<p class="indent">Of course we don’t always feel like smiling, but if we make the effort, we not only make those around us happier but also become happier ourselves. You may not be a particularly exuberant, outgoing person, but a simple smile takes little effort—and the rewards can be astonishing.</p>
<p class="indent">For the past decade, as email and texting have supplanted oral communication, we’ve been seduced by the fallacious notion that we live in an emotional desert. Entrepreneurs, business owners, and many professionals can carry on business with only a minimum of tactile interaction. Many modern two-dimensional media allow all of us at one time or another to forget about the importance of a smile.</p>
<p class="indent">In many ways texts and emails of today are like the telegraph messages of old, which had their own share of troubles. A reporter once telegraphed actor Cary Grant about his age. “HOW OLD CARY GRANT?” the message read.</p>
<p class="indent">The actor replied, “OLD CARY GRANT FINE. HOW YOU?”</p>
<p class="indent">Clearly the human proclivity toward misunderstanding is high. Throw in technology and it becomes all the more inevitable. Where telegrams were once ubiquitous, today’s technology can be suffocating.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1929, at the telegram’s peak, 200 million of them were sent. By April 2010 nearly 300 billion email messages were sent every day.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch02en11"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch02en11a">11</a></span> Pile on a daily worldwide barrage of text messages, instant messages, and Facebook wall posts, and it is a small wonder the world hasn’t descended into anarchy.</p>
<p class="indent">Thank goodness for smiles, which can do a better job of clarifying our messages than anything—even if they take the form of traditional emoticons, little faces composed of ordinary <a id="page_56"/>keyboard characters designed to give much-needed context for our communications.</p>
<p class="indent">Recognizing the limitations of these symbols, the three largest Japanese cell phone companies—NTT DoCoMo, au, and Soft-Bank Mobile—created emojis, color pictures displaying a broad range of emotions and symbols to better emulate the face-to-face experience. Google has now adopted them for its email platform, and they are being rapidly integrated into iPhones. Yet while these clever little symbols are endearing, they are unlikely to appear within your next digital message to a board member, a problem employee, or a prospective client. Emoticons are largely for use in casual conversations, and in such contexts they serve well. How, then, do we smile across all media and, when necessary, maintain a certain level of professionalism in the process?</p>
<p class="indent">There is little doubt that letting another see your smile is most effective, but because so many of our interactions today are not face-to-face, you must turn your resources toward overcoming the obstacles to exhibiting friendliness across digital space. It may be simpler than you think.</p>
<p class="indent">Outside of emoticons and emojis, there is only one medium in which you can convey a digital smile—your voice, whether it is written or spoken. How you write an email, the tone you use, and the words you choose are critical tools of friendliness and subsequent influence. Your written words are like the corners of your mouth: they turn up, they remain straight, or they turn down. The subsequent effect—whether the words garner friendships and influence—has much to do with the linear trajectory of the emotion they convey.</p>
<p class="indent">Smile through your written words and you convey to others that their well-being is important to you. You and your message will have the best chance of being received. Frown through your words and others will often frown on the message and messenger.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_57"/>These conclusions certainly do not account for those occasions when a more serious tone ought to be taken. Still, a good rule of thumb here is to make sure the linear thread of the message trends upward. Always begin and end the message on a positive note rather than on a pessimistic or detached one. Between two people there is nearly always a reason to smile. If you can’t see a reason, then perhaps you need to wait before you write or not write at all. As many relationships have been damaged by insensitive, knee-jerk notes as by verbal insults or tirades.</p>
<p class="indent">The reason is simple: Written words and their effect are permanent and largely irrefutable. While you might argue against your email’s negative or tactless tone, the echoing effect it has on its recipient is nearly impossible to silence. And today that effect can multiply quickly, damaging relations between employees, departments, and even entire value chains.</p>
<p class="indent">According to a recent issue of <em>Fast Company,</em> “New research is adding a Twittery flavor to the old adage ‘birds of a feather flock together,’ because it suggests happy twitterers tend to aggregate.” The article goes on to explain, “Above many other factors that cause people to aggregate together, people who are sad or happy tend to communicate on Twitter with other people who are sad, or happy.”</p>
<p class="indent">The research team, including University of Indiana professor Johan Bollen, analyzed the tweet streams from 102,000 Twitter users over six months, examining 129 million tweets.</p>
<p class="blockquote1">The analysis used standard algorithms borrowed from psychological research to assess the “subjective well-being” of users from their tweets by looking for trends in positive or negative words. Then they looked at aggregation trends, and found that happier people are more usually found re-tweeting <a id="page_58"/>and messaging other Twitter users who are also happy. The same is true for unhappy people.</p>
<p class="indent1">From the findings, Bollen suggests a tweet is more infectious than we realize, “and very effectively communicates joy or sadness. People who are happy would then tend to prefer (on average) happier fellow tweeters because they echo their own emotions.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch02en12"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch02en12a">12</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">The fact remains—if you can’t convey the proper amount of positive emotion in a written note, you are better off leaving the page blank, or perhaps even inserting an emoji (to the detriment of your professional reputation). There are worse things, in other words, than being thought a bit unprofessional. Avoiding negative sentiment with your written words altogether is obviously the goal. It is largely possible. Perhaps it is time to rethink the value of those writing skills your teachers insisted would be necessary one day. They were right, after all.</p>
<p class="indent">The other way in which you convey your digital voice, your spoken words, has heavy implications as well. How you speak, the tone in your voice, and the words you choose often express more than the words themselves. You have no doubt heard the retort: “Your actions speak so loudly I can hardly hear a word you are saying.” It is just as true to assert: “Your tone speaks so loudly I can hardly hear a word you are saying.”</p>
<p class="indent">Asserting you are glad to meet someone on a phone call means little if said with minimal facial movement and no positive inflection. It simply comes across that you are bored or busy with something more important, or worse, the complete opposite message—that meeting the person is an unpleasant proposition. Avoiding such situations begins in the same way it would begin if you were standing in front of the person.</p>
<p class="indent">Numerous studies have shown that the physical act of <a id="page_59"/>smiling, even while on a phone call, actually improves the tone in which your words are conveyed. It is no coincidence that one of the central tenets that all speaking, singing, and broadcasting coaches drill into their students is that your voice sounds more pleasant, more inviting, and more compelling when you are smiling. A smile, in other words, translates across wires whether or not the person on the receiving end can see your face.</p>
<p class="indent">When seeking influence that leads to positive change, there is no sidestepping the door of healthy human relations. A smile opens this door whether it’s visible, written, or verbal.</p>
<p class="indent">Rosalind Picard is a professor at the MIT Media Lab and internationally known for her book <em>Affective Computing,</em> about giving technology emotional qualities that help people communicate more effectively. The advances she highlights are nothing short of staggering—machines with “faces” that can respond appropriately to reprimands or praise, encouragement or rebuke.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch02en13"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch02en13a">13</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">Of course, these machines are merely responding to preprogrammed commands, much as a computer screen responds when a key is pushed. These machines mimic physical cues, words, and verbal tone, yet they do not feel. It is worth noting that humans can program such technology. This fact alone provides compelling evidence of how well we know pat responses to others’ cues, words, and tone. We are wired in the same way we wire our technologies, only with feeling to boot.</p>
<p class="indent">“There are two kinds of people,” blogged media maven Chris Brogan,</p>
<p class="blockquote1">those who see the computer/internet/buttons as being attached to human, feeling beings, and those who think it’s just online and that it doesn’t attach. That’s like saying the phone is just something to talk into and there’s no emotions there, either. It’s <a id="page_60"/>not just online. People do have feelings that they associate to these “at a distance” places.</p>
<p class="blockquote2">Yes, people overreact. We agree there. But to dismiss emotions simply because of the medium would be to dismiss letters, telephones, pictures, etc. Lots of things happen at a distance and yet convey consequences.</p>
<p class="blockquote2">I think there are most definitely two sets of minds at work, and that by realizing the above, it describes/defines a lot of those times when one side or the other feels misunderstood. Just remembering this one detail, and realizing which of the two people you’re dealing with [and which one others perceive you to be], and things might get better.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch02en14"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch02en14a">14</a></span></p>
<p class="indent1">Emotions, it seems, are the boundless gifts (and burdens) that humans carry. This can either discourage or encourage. Your mouth has a lot to say about your choice.</p>
<p class="indent">A smile, someone once said,</p>
<p class="blockquote1">costs nothing but gives much. It enriches those who receive without making poorer those who give. It takes but a moment, but the memory of it sometimes lasts forever. None is so rich or mighty that he cannot get along without it and none is so poor that he cannot be made rich by it. Yet a smile cannot be bought, begged, borrowed, or stolen, for it is something that is of no value to anyone until it is given away. Some people are too tired to give you a smile. Give them one of yours, as none needs a smile so much as he who has no more to give.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch02en15"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch02en15a">15</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">Smile. It increases your face value.</p>
