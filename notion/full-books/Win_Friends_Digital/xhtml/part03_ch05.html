<p class="paraspaceabove"><span class="big"><strong>L</strong></span>ike. Friend. Follow. Share.</p>
<p class="indent">In the digital age, affinity often exists before we share the first hello. In Carnegie’s time friendship and commonality walked hand in hand. You met. You talked. You found common ground and with it a fondness that led to deeper friendship. Today people follow you on Twitter or belong to the same Facebook group or “like” your latest video on YouTube before you ever meet. Often there are numerous threads of affinity before you actually meet.</p>
<p class="indent">With the particulars of what we like and dislike—digital buttons and thumbs-up included—we give and are given permission to make agreements and disagreements based solely on affinity. We have points of affinity and points of dissonance, and more often than not, we gravitate and grant influence to those with whom we have the most in common. This can be a tremendous boost to building lasting relationships in which influence exists.</p>
<p class="indent">We are not speaking of the law of attraction. You can think about having lots of friends with whom you have lots of influence, but nothing much will change if you don’t take genuine, meaningful action to build those relationships. We <a id="page_134"/>are speaking of what author John C. Maxwell calls “the law of magnetism.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Effective leaders are always on the lookout for good people,” he writes.</p>
<p class="blockquote1">Think about it. Do you know who you’re looking for right now? What is your profile of perfect employees? What qualities do these people possess? Do you want them to be aggressive and entrepreneurial? Are you looking for leaders? Do you care whether they are in their twenties, forties, or sixties? . . . Now, what will determine whether the people you want are the people you get, whether they will possess the qualities you desire? You may be surprised by the answer. Believe it or not, who you get is not determined by what you <em>want</em>. It’s determined by who you <em>are</em>.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch05en1"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch05en1a">1</a></span></p>
<p class="indent1">Like attracts like—in character and commonality. Today, however, we can have a head start. We can ascertain affinity before we approach a person. Liking serves, in the digital age, as a perfect door to influence.</p>
<p class="indent">When someone joins the same Facebook group, follows your blog, or comments on a website, he or she is saying yes to you. That creates an intensely powerful position to hold if you want to influence that person.</p>
<p class="indent">When a person says no and really means it, a physiological cascade of reactions is taking place that is putting the person in a defensive position, ready to withdraw. But when this same person says yes and really means it, he is in a position of acceptance, of openness, of moving forward. So the more yeses you can get at the outset of an interaction, even if they have little to do with the ultimate proposal, the more likely you are to put the person in a mood to agree with you along the way.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_135"/>Getting to yes is so much easier if you start with yes.</p>
<p class="indent">We have an obvious opportunity—a positive position from which to start dialogue. With the vast opportunities available to us to connect with the people who are interested in who we are and what we have to say, there is little excuse for starting a relationship, or even a conversation, on the wrong foot.</p>
<p class="indent">More than that, organizations have the power to get their constituents saying yes based purely on the influence of the community. Microsoft understood this well when it released Windows 7.</p>
<p class="indent">The computer giant had been dealt a blow with the exasperating launch of Windows Vista, a universally derided operating system. But it was ready to reenter the fray with Windows 7, and it had learned from past experiences. It had to get its customers, its users, onboard right from the start. It had to get them saying yes. First it had to find its fans, the potential influencers in the community of PC users.</p>
<p class="indent">In <em>Empowered,</em> authors Josh Bernoff and Ted Schadler explore Microsoft’s strategy for getting back in the ring. To combat the slick Mac-versus-PC commercials that depicted the PC as a nerdy, inefficient, outdated number cruncher, it solicited “I’m a PC” videos directly from users via a YouTube channel. It edited them together to create a powerful beginning to their yes-based marketing campaign. When it released a beta version of Windows 7 to targeted users, it trolled the feedback on blogs, Twitter, Facebook, discussion forums, and other social communities. In preparation for the market release, it created a moderated feed of the content posted on a host of other sites and platforms and presented the feed on its website, Facebook page, and elsewhere. It created advertising featuring users, highlighting the concept that Windows 7 was designed in part as a result of customer suggestions. The tagline: “I’m a PC, and Windows 7 was my idea.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_136"/>The coup de grâce, though, was how it got its fans to celebrate Windows 7 and to share it with others. It offered an opportunity to its fans—it made them feel important.</p>
<p class="blockquote1">If you were a Windows 7 fan you could sign up to have a party in your home to show off the new features—Microsoft would send along materials. . . . Word about the party opportunities spread through social media and before long, tens of thousands of people in fourteen countries had signed up. Microsoft estimates that the parties reached about eight hundred thousand people, including hosts and guests.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch05en2"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch05en2a">2</a></span></p>
<p class="indent1">Considering how the release of Windows Vista had gone, PC users could have said no to Windows 7 right from the start, but Microsoft got them to say yes.</p>
<p class="indent">When we start with yes, at the most basic level we are creating affinity. But to turn affinity into influence, there must remain a foundation of empathy. We must be able to constantly see the interaction from another’s point of view so that we know the ultimate value of our points of affinity.</p>
<p class="indent">Rather than use social media opportunities to help us start from yes and maintain that necessary commitment, we often ignore what it is that others want and bombard them with our pitch. Instead of getting them to say, “Yes! Yes!” we force them to say, “Stop! Stop!” Social media guru Chris Brogan calls it the blizzard of business rather than a communication snowfall:</p>
<p class="blockquote1">Conversations and relationships are based on several touches. In the traditional marketing and communication world, people would use each touch to ask for something, to issue a call to action. This isn’t how social networks work. . . . They are there to give you permission to reach someone who has opted into <a id="page_137"/>a relationship with you. . . . It’s a snowfall. Every individual flake doesn’t mean a lot, but the body of work can change everything.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch05en3"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch05en3a">3</a></span></p>
<p class="indent1">You have to offer them what they want in your communication if you want to begin and remain at yes. Only then have you earned a level of trust that permits you to confidently offer others your pitch, whether it is for a product, service, or cause.</p>
<p class="indent">Of course, this principle is equally relevant and required outside of the digital realm. A newspaper company had a policy of delivering a new paper to customers who called to complain that their papers had been damaged by inclement weather. But over time rising gas prices and fewer subscriptions made it financially impossible to maintain the practice. So they sent what they believed to be a very friendly letter to their customers. It began something like this:</p>
<p class="blockquote1"><em>Dear valued customer,</em></p>
<p class="blockquote2"><em>We will no longer deliver replacement newspapers when previously delivered newspapers have been damaged by weather.</em></p>
<p class="indent1">They went on to explain the change in policy. And then, at the very end of the letter, they wrote this:</p>
<p class="blockquote2"><em>If you do receive a damaged newspaper, please let us know and we will refund the price of the newspaper on your next bill.</em></p>
<p class="indent1">The first response customers might have when reading this letter is irritation and protest. By the end of the letter, they’re <a id="page_138"/>too worked up to care that an alternative—and possibly a better one—is being offered.</p>
<p class="indent">What if, instead, the company had written the letter as follows:</p>
<p class="blockquote1"><em>Dear valued customer,</em></p>
<p class="blockquote2"><em>We recognize how frustrating it can be when the paper you receive is damaged due to the weather.</em> (Yes, it is!) <em>You pay for a product and service and expect quality in both areas.</em> (Yes, I do!) <em>Consequently, we will now offer a full refund for any paper you receive that has been rendered unreadable because of the weather.</em> (Really? Great!)</p>
<p class="blockquote2"><em>We also wanted to make you aware that, like you, our business has been affected by rising gas prices. Consequently, we will no longer be able to offer to deliver replacement papers. Just call us, and you will receive a refund instead.</em> (Oh, okay.)</p>
<p class="indent1">At the very least, customers might have viewed the actions of the company in a much more favorable light.</p>
<p class="indent">Today, there are two kinds of agreement. We need to keep both in mind where our interactions are concerned. The first kind of agreement is the common variety. It is the sort that surrounds two parties holding the same opinion on a particular issue. The presumption with this kind of agreement is that they were engaged at one time in a dialogue in which they uncovered their harmony of opinion. For most of us this sort of dialogue-based agreement is the only kind of agreement we consider.</p>
<p class="indent">But there is another kind of agreement that was far less feasible during Carnegie’s time but has become all the more important today. This second kind of agreement is based on two parties liking the same thing—or, as we might view it, being <a id="page_139"/>similar people. We don’t typically call this sort of harmony an “agreement,” but in the digital age it is best to think of it as such because we are always drawn to those with whom we have something in common.</p>
<p class="indent">Establishing this commonality or affinity at the outset is a new form of yes. The more early yeses you possess, the more likely you are to succeed in capturing a yes to your idea, solution, or transaction.</p>
<p class="indent">Access affinity as early and often as possible.<a id="page_140"/></p>
