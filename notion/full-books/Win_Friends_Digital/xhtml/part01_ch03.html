<p class="paraspaceabove"><span class="big"><strong>I</strong></span>n early 2002, <em>Time</em> put an odd-looking computer on its cover. It had a small, domed base and a jointed, shiny chrome neck affixed to a flat-screen monitor that enabled it to be pushed, pulled, turned, lowered or raised with the nudge of a finger. It was called the iMac, and the company introducing it, Apple Computer, desperately needed it to work in order to stay in business.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part01_ch03en1"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part01_ch03en1a">1</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">Apple had always been the darling of a particular computing niche—generally creative, antiestablishment types. But in the article that accompanied the cover story, its CEO, Steve Jobs, enunciated a brand-new vision for consumers.</p>
<p class="indent">He said he believed the future lay in the PC as the “digital hub” of camcorders, digital cameras, MP3 players, Palm PDAs, cell phones, and DVD players. He risked the company’s future on a vision of a place where an entire digital life could be consolidated. And so with the iMac came a free suite of software that today is synonymous with the digital age—iTunes, iPhoto, and iMovie.</p>
<p class="indent">Critics and competitors mocked Jobs. Some of Apple’s longtime rivals called the computer “clownish” and “silly” and the vision “far too grand.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_28"/>The public? They embraced the vision and the life that it promised. And Apple Computer, now simply Apple, has seen its share price increase 4,856 percent. The closest competitor has increased approximately 14 percent.</p>
<p class="indent">Why?</p>
<p class="indent">Is it because other computer companies would prefer no one buy their products? Of course not—they all want to be successful. They all want to be well liked. What they are after is more and more influence in the form of people consuming their products.</p>
<p class="indent">The difference is that Steve Jobs recognized something Dale Carnegie championed repeatedly: to influence others to act, you must first connect to a core desire within them.</p>
<p class="indent">This is a universal truth whether you are dealing with children or clients or calves. One day the famous philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson and his son were trying to get a calf into the barn. It was going rather poorly. They pushed and the calf pulled. They pulled and the calf pushed.</p>
<p class="indent">Meanwhile, their housemaid noticed their predicament, and though she couldn’t write brilliant essays or books, she possessed an insight she thought might solve the problem. She walked over to the calf and put her finger in its mouth. While the calf suckled, she gently led it into the barn.</p>
<p class="indent">What did the maid know that the luminous philosopher had forgotten?</p>
<p class="indent">She knew that one of the calf’s core desires was food. Once she tapped into that desire, the calf willingly followed.</p>
<p class="indent">Emerson and his son merely thought about what they desired—the calf in the barn so they could eat their lunch. But the calf, happily grazing in a green pasture, had little interest in descending into a dark, confined barn that curtailed his dining options. That is, until the housemaid showed up, offered her <a id="page_29"/>finger, and reminded the calf that some warm milk was in his future.</p>
<p class="indent">It is an excellent metaphor because it reminds us of two key insights we often overlook when trying to influence others.</p>
<p class="numberlist">1. Influence requires more intuition than intellect. The critical contrast between the luminary Emerson and his humble housemaid is not one of dissimilar brainpower. While Emerson was likely the more learned of the two, the divergence between them was one of intuition. The housemaid had what Emerson lacked.</p>
<p class="indent1">The public world tends to freely ascribe sway to those in lofty positions that require much education and aptitude—the CEO, department chair, physician, and billionaire. We assume such people can move majorities with a whisper and the snap of a finger. But as Guy Kawasaki, former chief evangelist at Apple, pointed out, “If such a person does not have a deep relationship with people, she won’t have much influence with them.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part01_ch03en2"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part01_ch03en2a">2</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">The truth is that such stately individuals possess merely above-average conditions to influence, while the way in which influence is won remains no different for them than for anyone else. Influence is no respecter of education or experience; it goes only with the one who will set aside his status—be it high and mighty or low and lowly—and put himself in the place of another. To do so takes a shrewd and spontaneous ability to read beneath the surface of an interaction. “What is essential,” wrote Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, “is invisible to the eye.” This is an important truth to keep in mind when dealing with those you would like to win over. Influencing others is not a matter of outsmarting them. It is a matter of discerning what they truly want and offering it to them in a mutually beneficial package.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_30"/>“He knows so little and accomplishes so much,” Robert McFarlane, the third of President Reagan’s six national security advisors, once marveled of his boss. When Reagan “left Washington more popular than when he first took office,” writes Richard Norton Smith, he accomplished something that hadn’t been done since Dwight Eisenhower.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part01_ch03en3"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part01_ch03en3a">3</a></span> How? According to President Obama, “Reagan recognized the American people’s hunger for accountability and change. . . . He tapped into what people were already feeling.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part01_ch03en4"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part01_ch03en4a">4</a></span></p>
<p class="numberlist">2. Influence requires a gentle hand. There were Emerson and his son in a four-handed, eight-legged tug-of-war with the obstinate calf who was holding his ground. It is no way to sway another to your side. Onto the scene, in great contrast, strides the housemaid with an index finger extended, straight and not hooked no less, and the once stubborn calf is suddenly light on its hooves and willingly wrapped around the housemaid’s pointer.</p>
<p class="indent1">Lest we forget, it is a memorable image of what little moving we have to do to move another to action. As a constant reminder, former U.S. president Dwight Eisenhower displayed a paperweight in the Oval Office that, in Latin, read: “Gently in manner, strong in deed.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part01_ch03en5"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part01_ch03en5a">5</a></span> There is no question of his global influence.</p>
<p class="indent">“Action springs from what we fundamentally desire,” author Harry Overstreet writes in <em>Influencing Human Behavior</em>. “And the best piece of advice which can be given to would-be persuaders, whether in business, in the home, in the school, in politics, is: First, arouse in the other person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part01_ch03en6"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part01_ch03en6a">6</a></span></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_31"/>The practice of connecting with core desires is applicable across industry lines and international borders. It is as important for the energy executive from Holland as it is the executive producer in Hollywood. The interpersonal efforts that inevitably succeed are those in which the messenger stops dictating and starts discovering what the recipient wants. The interpersonal efforts that inevitably fail, be they corporate collaboration, personal cooperation, or artistic rendering, are those in which the messenger attempts to tell the recipient what he wants. This is perhaps no more evident than in the sales industry, an industry of which, in a semantic sense, we are all part.</p>
<p class="indent">In his book <em>Killing the Sale</em> bestselling author Todd Duncan describes the ten fatal mistakes salespeople make. One of them he calls “arguing,” and when we fail to connect with another’s core needs we are just as guilty of it, whether or not we call selling our profession.</p>
<p class="blockquote1">The mistake of arguing . . . is staking your sales success on your ability to state your case in convincing fashion. It’s mastering a monologue and then expecting the jury of your prospects to be convinced to take your side. But . . . establishing an initial level of trust takes more than flowery monologue. It takes dialogue. It takes actual conversation. There is no other way for you to know your product or service will meet [a person’s] needs.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part01_ch03en7"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part01_ch03en7a">7</a></span></p>
<p class="indent1">He later cites Dr. Theodore Zeldin, author of <em>Conversation,</em> who makes the point succinctly: “Real conversation catches fire.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part01_ch03en8"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part01_ch03en8a">8</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">It is mind-boggling that despite the millions of branding and marketing dollars spent every year, much is still spent on the messengers’ wants or whimsies rather than the recipients’ core desires. We get an idea in our head for who we want to be or how we want others to perceive our offering, and we spend more <a id="page_32"/>time shaping and shining that image than we do ascertaining whether the image really matters to those to whom it must matter. Most individuals and organizations invest more resources in campaigning than in connecting. It should be the other way around.</p>
<p class="indent">Consider the comparison chart Duncan offers juxtaposing what the two forms of interpersonal communication say about you:<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part01_ch03en9"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part01_ch03en9a">9</a></span></p>

<p class="indent1">Of course, connecting to people’s core desires does not mean the world will be your oyster. Suffice it to say that without this approach, others will remain largely unapproachable. Their ears will close and their eyes will look elsewhere for something or someone more engaging. And their options are endless in the very world Steve Jobs saw in 2002.</p>
<p class="indent">Fortunately, most corporate emails, company tweets, brand blog entries, and commercial ad campaigns are monologues meant to broadcast opinions, distinguish brands, launch products, and construct personas. It is precisely because this is so that the person who speaks in a spirit of dialogue and altruistic discovery nabs a significant advantage.</p>
<p class="indent">How do you know if you hold this advantage?</p>
<p class="indent">An honest inventory of your impact is usually enough. Have your employees really stepped it up, or do they remain in a cycle <a id="page_33"/>of fits and falters? You are confident your marriage is on the upswing, but what does your spouse have to say? You insist the customers are impressed by your new products; does your sales revenue concur? You say your brand is sweeping the nation, but against what standard are you measuring brand recognition?</p>
<p class="indent">In <em>The Seven Arts of Change,</em> author David Shaner clarifies the difference between those who truly connect with core desires and those who are merely playing influence the way kids play doctor. He writes,</p>
<p class="blockquote1">Nearly every study of organizational change over the past two decades indicates that companies fail to make the change they intend approximately seventy percent of the time. . . . Before organizational change can succeed, it must first occur at the subtle spiritual level in the individuals of the organization. . . . All lasting transformation must begin there because, ultimately, your spirit and mine is the primary driver of all our behavior.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part01_ch03en10"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part01_ch03en10a">10</a></span></p>
<p class="indent1">True change is born of an interpersonal reach that takes hold of the deepest part of an individual. Shaner’s explanation is dead on, and he should know. His company, CONNECT Consulting, has for thirty years helped multinational corporations such as Duracell, Ryobi, MARC USA, and SVP Worldwide lead successful company change efforts. His words remind us that no companywide campaign or individual communication strategy garners influence until it connects with people at their core. It is an essential principle in all your efforts to influence others, whether your audience is a five-year-old child or five thousand employees.</p>
<p class="indent">A former U.S. secretary of education once recounted how he didn’t learn this essential element of engagement until after his first year on the job.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_34"/>He felt pretty good about his progress. He’d ventured out and given speeches, and people had applauded and smiled. He’d attended many dinner parties and sumptuous gatherings, and all seemed to go off without a hitch. But to what end?</p>
<p class="indent">While home over Christmas with time to reflect, he came to acknowledge that while he’d been highly visible and highly promissory, nothing in the department had really changed. Five thousand employees showed up on time. They completed their assigned work. They went home. There was movement, but few if any were moved, inside or outside the office walls.</p>
<p class="indent">He wanted to understand why. Over the first two months of the following year he spent a lot of time with the people who really ran the Department of Education—the career civil service workers who pressed forward no matter which political party filled the White House. He came to the sobering realization that while he stood on the bridge, turning the wheel, the wheel wasn’t connected to anything below. And since he had no authority to hire or fire from the civil service ranks, the only way he could influence positive progress in the department was by winning them over. The problem was, they’d seen politicians come and go. They’d grown tired and cynical. They’d given up on deriving inspiration from the top.</p>
<p class="indent">The secretary’s wife suggested the way to win them over was by reminding them he was passionate about education, and to do so not with new words but with new actions. “Go to schools, spend time with kids. Do retail. Everyone will notice because these are the things they really care about.”</p>
<p class="indent">“I don’t do retail,” he huffed. “I’m the secretary of education. I do wholesale.”</p>
<p class="indent">His wife, the daughter of a salesman, smiled. “Darling,” she said, “if you can’t do retail, you’ll never do wholesale.”</p>
<p class="indent">She was right, and the secretary knew it.</p>
<p class="indent">For the next year he toured the country, rolled up his sleeves, <a id="page_35"/>read stories, listened to teachers, and was reminded how much he loved retail education. It was a personal victory. More significant, however, was the effect his actions had on his employees. Their passion was revived—passion for their daily tasks, for better education, for more opportunities for more families. They were inspired by the secretary’s work because his actions had accomplished something the speeches and sumptuous gatherings had not. They had tapped a core desire of the tireless Department of Education workers: purpose. They wanted to believe again. They just needed to be reminded that their work still mattered. The secretary offered this reminder, and it dramatically turned the tide.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part01_ch03en11"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part01_ch03en11a">11</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">In our rushed world, it is easy to forgo the secretary’s level of analysis. So much of our digital communication is one-way that we come to believe we have limited opportunity to uncover another’s perspective. While we communicate with more and more people every day, we also become more insular in our approach. We are far more inclined to focus on how we can best broadcast our points from our own perspective, quickly, broadly, or both. Isn’t this what we witness all around us?</p>
<p class="indent">It is easy to get so caught up in the fray that we forget what we are aiming for: connection, influence, agreement, collaboration. We can start to believe the battle is won by mere frequency and occasional originality—useful strategies in the right context, but greatly insufficient as your only influence strategies.</p>
<p class="indent">There is a good side, however, to this constant barrage of onesided broadcasting, which spans the spectrum from corporate posturing to celebrity positioning. Today, with a few keystrokes, we can better educate ourselves about other people’s perspectives and goals.</p>
<p class="indent">Earlier we discussed the dangers of using your digital space to spout off your complaints. Most of us are more discerning about what we divulge. We reveal what matters to us, what we think <a id="page_36"/>about often, what we love and like and hope to see happen soon. These tidbytes of information add up to a body of knowledge that offers clues or even clear windows to our core desires. This knowledge is invaluable where influence in concerned because, like the calf that just wanted more food, we only move toward what moves us.</p>
