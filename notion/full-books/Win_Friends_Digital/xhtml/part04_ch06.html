<p class="paraspaceabove"><span class="big"><strong>O</strong></span>ne bright day in 2010, the hotel company Best Western created a special Facebook page. Visitors flocked to it. Hundreds of messages were posted to the wall.</p>
<p class="indent">“Wallace makes weary travelers feel like they’re coming home! The best thing about the hotel lobby is his smile.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Wallace is the best. We love going back just to visit with him!”</p>
<p class="indent">“Upon leaving, the kids asked when we were coming back to see Wallace!”</p>
<p class="indent">“I may pass him in the lobby or the hall fifteen times in a visit, and every time, he has a great big smile and something fun to say. He is one of the greatest parts of my visits!”</p>
<p class="indent">“We should all relate to one another as Wallace does. If he ever has a bad day, you wouldn’t know it.”</p>
<p class="indent">“In all of my travels, I’ve never encountered anyone more kind and helpful, more eager to make a guest feel welcome.”</p>
<p class="indent">“My day is always made brighter by seeing Wallace. His always warm welcome, his knowledge of the city, his kindness and professionalism, and that terrific smile make my stay so enjoyable. . . . He has a special gift for connecting with people.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_208"/>Who is this Wallace? Wallace Pope—Chicago native, single dad, longtime employee of Best Western River North Hotel, and a man who loves helping others.</p>
<p class="indent">When Wallace was nominated for the Stars of the Industry award from the Illinois Hotel and Lodging Association, Best Western was determined to show its pride and support—and to help him win.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part04_ch06en1"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part04_ch06en1a">1</a></span> So the company created a Facebook page called “Wallace Should Win” and encouraged visitors to the hotel to go to the page and share their stories of Wallace’s customer service skills. The page had 2,722 visits within the first week. Heartfelt stories of love and support poured in from the hotel’s customers. Wallace’s genuine kindness and his ability to improve customers’ travel and personal outlook were lauded again and again. And while Wallace didn’t win the award, the praise and encouragement he gained from the Facebook page was far more meaningful than a plaque.</p>
<p class="indent">Praise and encouragement: the two essential elements of motivating any person to fulfill their potential, to improve, or to tackle change. Yet it’s difficult for many of us to recognize the efforts of those around us.</p>
<p class="indent">Dr. Gerald Graham was curious about what managers could do to better motivate employees. So he surveyed fifteen hundred employees, and the results were rather shocking:</p>
<p class="bulletlista">• 58 percent reported that they seldom if ever received praise from their manager</p>
<p class="bulletlist">• 76 percent reported that they seldom if ever received written thanks</p>
<p class="bulletlist">• 81 percent reported that they seldom if ever received praise in public</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_209"/>And yet praise from a manager, written thanks, and public praise were three of the top five motivators among the surveyed employees.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part04_ch06en2"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part04_ch06en2a">2</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">These results were from 1982. Decades later, things haven’t changed all that much. Employees who receive frequent praise are still more productive, and organizations in which employees receive frequent praise are universally more successful. It’s one of the twelve indicators of success that Marcus Buckingham and Curt Koffman outline in <em>First, Break All the Rules</em>, indicators based on extensive Gallup Organization research. Yet managers are still notoriously bad at delivering praise.</p>
<p class="indent">We all crave appreciation; we all desire to feel important. And when we have improved in some way or performed well, receiving praise sends a clear message that others have noticed and that it makes a difference. This is true at work, at home, at school, in our communities. One of the basic psychological tenets of human behavior is that we persist in behaviors for which we are praised; those behaviors that are not positively recognized are likely to fall by the wayside.</p>
<p class="indent">The Center for Management and Organization Effectiveness offers the following advice for praising those around you:<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part04_ch06en3"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part04_ch06en3a">3</a></span></p>
<p class="numberlist">1. “Deliver praise from your heart.” Be genuine and sincere.</p>
<p class="numberlista">2. “Deliver praise as soon as possible.” Don’t wait for the next meeting, performance review, family meal, or church gathering. By then, the person’s own joy at the success has dissipated, and you’ve lost an opportunity to amplify that joy.</p>
<p class="numberlista">3. “Make praise specific.” A simple thank-you is not praise; it is politeness. To feel that their efforts are heading them down the path you want them to go, people need to know exactly what you valued in their effort.</p>
<p class="numberlista">4. “Praise people publicly.” In this era of social technology, praising publicly gets easier every day, so there is no real <a id="page_210"/>excuse not to do it. Best Western certainly did. Today you don’t have to wait for the next quarterly meeting to recognize a job well done.</p>
<p class="indent1">We should strive to praise as often as possible. Most of us don’t have to struggle to find opportunities to do so; we simply have to take advantage of the opportunities that exist every day.</p>
<p class="indent">Captain Abrashoff of the USS <em>Benfold</em> understood the power of praise better than most:</p>
<p class="blockquote1">Most of my young sailors came from hardscrabble backgrounds and had struggled to make it into the Navy. I put myself in their parents’ shoes and imagined how they would feel if they got letters from their kids’ commanding officer, and I imagined how the kids would feel when their parents told them. I began writing letters to the parents, especially when their sons or daughters did something I could honestly praise. When the letters arrived, the parents invariably called their children to say how proud they were of them.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part04_ch06en4"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part04_ch06en4a">4</a></span></p>
<p class="indent1">One sailor was part of a team that had performed very well, but was himself not a star. Captain Abrashoff recognized that praising his accomplishments as part of a team would give this sailor the boost he most likely needed. So he sent the letter of praise to the young man’s parents. Two weeks later, the sailor knocked on Captain Abrashoff’s door with tears streaming down his face.</p>
<p class="indent">“I just got a call from my father, who all my life told me I’m a failure. This time, he said he’s just read your letter, and he wanted to congratulate me and say how proud he was of me. It’s the first time in my entire life he’s actually encouraged me.”</p>
<p class="indent">Obviously this was a powerful moment for this young man. <a id="page_211"/>How do you think it affected his view of what he could achieve and his level of devotion to the success of his team?</p>
<p class="indent">Praise, while powerful and necessary, also implies evaluation against some standard. What great leaders and those with influence recognize is that the rest of the time, we must use encouragement. “Praise is given only when one achieves ‘good’ results; encouragement can be given any time, even when things go poorly.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part04_ch06en5"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part04_ch06en5a">5</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">That is the essence of encouragement—showing your belief in the talents, skills, and inherent abilities of another person because she exists, regardless of how things are going right now.</p>
<p class="indent">Being encouraging requires a special attitude. When you look at another person, rather than seeing her faults, you need to be able to see her strengths and possibilities, what she is capable of. Insincere encouragement, without the strength of your genuine faith in the other person, only belittles her efforts.</p>
<p class="indent">What does encouragement foster in the other person? Psychological hardiness—the ability to weather the stressful and anxiety-inducing challenges that we encounter every day, to face those challenges and move forward in spite of them, to pick ourselves up and keep going, keep trying. It is the hallmark of positive, successful people.</p>
<p class="indent">Encouragement provides motivation, and finding ways to motivate is a huge struggle for leaders in all areas of life. The primary cause of that struggle? Many of us don’t take the time to consider what actually motivates people. We often assume that people want material rewards, that the carrot-and-stick approach is the best approach—but this is rarely the case. People are genuinely more motivated by personal and social encouragement than by material rewards.</p>
<p class="indent">Through his research on healthy marriages and families, <a id="page_212"/>author and psychologist Jon Carlson defined some essential practices that we can use to create an encouraging environment:<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part04_ch06en6"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part04_ch06en6a">6</a></span></p>
<p class="numberlist">1. Make healthy relationships a priority. Respect and positive communication are two key elements of making that happen.</p>
<p class="numberlista">2. Practice encouragement daily. Don’t wait until somebody has stumbled on the path toward a goal. Recognize every effort and every improvement, even if it is slight, to let them know that your faith in them is unwavering.</p>
<p class="numberlista">3. Be inclusive. For instance, include others in your decisionmaking process whenever possible; it shows your faith in their sound judgment.</p>
<p class="numberlista">4. Don’t let conflicts fester. When we’re in conflict mode, it’s easy to slip into discouraging or belittling dialogue. Compare “I think you can do it” and “Looks like we have problem—what should we do about it?” with “Just let me take care of this” or “I told you to be careful.”</p>
<p class="numberlista">5. Have fun!</p>
<p class="indent1">Clarence M. Jones, a Carnegie Institute instructor, told how encouragement and making faults seem easy to correct completely changed the life of his son:</p>
<p class="blockquote1">My son David, who was then fifteen years old, came to live with me in Cincinnati. He had led a rough life. In 1958 his head was cut open in a car accident, leaving a very bad scar on his forehead. In 1960 his mother and I were divorced and he moved to Dallas, Texas, with his mother. He had spent most of his school years in special classes for slow learners. Possibly because of the scar, school administrators had decided he was brain-injured and could not function at a normal level. He was <a id="page_213"/>two years behind his age group, so he was only in the seventh grade. Yet he did not know his multiplication tables, added on his fingers, and could barely read.</p>
<p class="blockquote2">There was one positive point. He loved to work on radio and TV sets. He wanted to become a TV technician. I encouraged this and pointed out that he needed math to qualify for the training. I decided to help him become proficient in this subject. We obtained four sets of flash cards: multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction. As we went through the cards, we put the correct answers in a discard stack. When David missed one, I gave him the correct answer and then put the card in the repeat stack until there were no more cards left. I made a big deal out of each card he got right, particularly if he had missed it previously.</p>
<p class="blockquote2">Each night we would go through the repeat stack until there were no cards left. Each night we timed the exercise with a stopwatch. I promised him that when he could get all the cards correct in eight minutes with no incorrect answers, we would quit doing it every night. This seemed an impossible goal to David. The first night it took 52 minutes, the second night, 48, then 45, 44, 41, then under 40 minutes. We celebrated each reduction. I’d call in my wife and we would both hug him and we’d all dance a jig. At the end of the month he was doing all the cards perfectly in less than eight minutes. When he made a small improvement he would ask to do it again. He had made the fantastic discovery that learning was easy and fun.</p>
<p class="blockquote2">Naturally his grades in algebra took a jump. It is amazing how much easier algebra is when you can multiply. He astonished himself by bringing home a B in math. That had never happened before. Other changes came with almost unbelievable rapidity. His reading improved rapidly, and he began to use his natural talents in drawing. Later in the school year his <a id="page_214"/>science teacher assigned him to develop an exhibit. He chose to develop a highly complex series of models to demonstrate the effect of levers. It required skill not only in drawing and model making but in applied mathematics. The exhibit took first prize in his school’s science fair and was entered in the city competition and won third prize for the entire city of Cincinnati.</p>
<p class="blockquote2">That did it. Here was a kid who had flunked two grades, who had been told he was “brain-damaged,” who had been called “Frankenstein” by his classmates and told his brains must have leaked out of the cut on his head. Suddenly he discovered he could really learn and accomplish things. The result? From the last quarter of the eighth grade all the way through high school, he never failed to make the honor roll; in high school he was elected to the national honor society. Once he found learning was easy, his whole life changed.</p>
<p class="indent1">Tell someone that you have total faith in his ability to accomplish a goal and encourage him by highlighting all of the skills he possesses that will help him along the way, and he will practice until the dawn comes in the window in order to excel.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember, abilities wither under criticism and blossom under encouragement. Magnify improvement and you maximize others’ talents.</p>
