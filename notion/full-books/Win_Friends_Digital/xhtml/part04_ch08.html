<p class="paraspaceabove"><span class="big"><strong>T</strong></span>he employees of a manufacturing company had been on strike for six months when a labor contract was finally agreed upon. The terms, however, were less than what the employees had originally asked for. While the employees did return to work, tensions were running high on both sides. The working environment was toxic. How could they get past the animosity and move forward?</p>
<p class="indent">In <em>Crucial Conversations,</em> authors Kerry Patterson, Joseph Grenny, Ron McMillan, and Al Switzer described how they worked with the two groups to build bridges. They instructed each group to spend time considering their goals for the company and to write them out on poster-sized paper. Each group spent two hours discussing their goals, then wrote the goals on the paper and posted it on the wall in the room they were in. The coaches then asked the teams to switch rooms and to review the other group’s goals with the purpose of finding at least some morsel of common ground.</p>
<p class="indent">What do you think happened?</p>
<p class="indent">When the two groups returned to the meeting room, they <a id="page_222"/>were amazed. Their goals were almost identical: “a profitable company, stable and rewarding jobs, high-quality products, and a positive impact on the community.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part04_ch08en1"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part04_ch08en1a">1</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">While this revelation didn’t erase the past, it provided each group with a new perspective on the other. They learned something about each other that would make it easier to reach more positive outcomes in the future.</p>
<p class="indent">Why is common ground so important? For a leader to effectively influence another’s attitude or behavior, he needs to overcome any potential resistance by making the person feel glad to do what is being asked. We aren’t talking about manipulation or mind control here. If you consider what the other’s goals are and how to connect your goals to hers, you will create a win-win situation that will make everybody glad.</p>
<p class="indent">It is amazing how simple it is today to find a connection with another when we take the time to. If you go on an interview or a sales call, wouldn’t you spend time researching the company, discovering its vision, its stated goals, its values? All of this is information that many companies post front and center on their websites. And many go much further, posting employee bios, press releases, and updated information on their blogs.</p>
<p class="indent">Yet we often don’t take the time to make these same inroads with those in our lives, those standing right in front of us, even though it is just as easy. Ask people what they did over the weekend, what they hope to do for their next vacation, or what books they’ve recently read, and you’ll discover something compelling and revealing about their goals, their dreams. And if you’re connected with them online, it may be even easier.</p>
<p class="indent">Six degrees to Kevin Bacon is an interesting pop culture phenomenon, but it’s actually a fantastic way to think about those you want to influence. When you expand the translation to include common interests, common experiences, common goals, <a id="page_223"/>the truth is that we are only one degree away from anyone. To be influential with others, to make them happy to do what it is we would like them to do, we simply have to find that one degree that connects us.</p>
<p class="indent">One student of the Dale Carnegie Training Institute in Germany discovered that taking the bold path of simply writing to those people she wanted to learn more about—to possibly find that one degree of connection—produced wondrous results.</p>
<p class="blockquote1">As I was very shy, I decided to write emails to the people I was interested in. I researched and found the addresses of very famous and well-known people and started to ask them questions about their backgrounds, such as how they got started in their businesses and what was important to them personally.</p>
<p class="blockquote2">Two weeks later I received a two-paged letter from the German president Johannes Rau, who answered my questions. Six weeks later I received another letter. It was a big envelope, and a book was enclosed that would answer my questions. It was sent to me by His Holiness the Dalai Lama.</p>
<p class="indent1">What did this person learn? If you make the effort, people—all people, even those who seem unapproachable—will tell you their stories, their motivations and their goals.</p>
<p class="indent">One night, Dana White, the president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship sports league, accidentally tweeted his direct phone number to more than one million fans, who retweeted it to untold numbers of people. The fans began calling within minutes. A leader less focused on making his customers happy would have called the phone company and had his number changed immediately. But that is not what Dana White did.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_224"/>For more than an hour and a half, he took the calls that came in and talked to the fans. They loved it.</p>
<p class="indent">It was a fortunate mistake, and Dana White learned a lot from it. He learned that talking to fans was valuable, and the PR company that helps manage UFC’s online presence learned that they had a new opportunity to “provide value to fans, when, where and how they want to receive it.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part04_ch08en2"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part04_ch08en2a">2</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">Now Dana White has a dedicated line that he uses to take calls from fans. It’s posted on all of his social media outlets. When he has time, he lets them know he’s ready to talk, and the phone starts ringing.</p>
<p class="indent">His accidental ninety minutes on the phone with UFC fans from all over the world was no gimmick, and that is key to ultimate fighting being the fastest-growing sport in the world, according to Mashable’s Greg Ferenstein.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part04_ch08en3"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part04_ch08en3a">3</a></span> White has been passionate about connecting with fans through social media from the start, and relied on the grassroots support of his fans when major media refused to cover UFC events. When he hired Digital Royalty to grow UFC’s online presence and train the fighters in social media techniques, he told the fighters, “I want you to tweet your asses off!” The secret of his success in connecting with his fans: he is brutally honest and frank.</p>
<p class="indent">To prove the power of this connection to a companion, White left a restaurant and walked to a nearby gas station at eleven-thirty at night. He tweeted his location. Within three minutes, there were about one hundred fans there.</p>
<p class="indent">In his analysis of Dana White’s efforts, Greg Ferenstein wrote, “Transparency, outreach and openness are now more important than ever, as social media allows fans to subvert traditional channels and voice their opinions directly. White is willing to meet them halfway, foregoing false showmanship in order to genuinely connect with fans.”</p>
<p class="indent">While social media is a great tool for learning what drives <a id="page_225"/>somebody, it is only a tool. What leaders need to foster within themselves is a genuine desire to ascertain the answer and then to act on the information, a desire that many failed executives undermine, both knowingly and unknowingly. Of this depreciated desire among many high-powered executives, <em>Derailed</em> author Dr. Tim Irwin concludes:</p>
<p class="blockquote1">Just as humility seems to be at the epicenter of leadership effectiveness, arrogance is commonly at the root of a leader’s undoing . . . and ours. . . . Arrogance takes many forms. The most rudimentary is the self-centered focus that fosters a belief that I am central to the viability of the organization, the department or the team. The resulting dismissiveness of others’ contributions is inevitable. When arrogance blossoms into hubris, a sense of entitlement results. “This place can’t function without me, and I deserve special perks.” Arrogant leaders also seem to eschew feedback so beneficial to any leader. They become truth-starved.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part04_ch08en4"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part04_ch08en4a">4</a></span></p>
<p class="indent1">A contrasting approach is found in Yvon Chouinard, co-founder (with his wife, Malinda) of Patagonia and author of <em>Let My People Go Surfing</em>. Yvon is proud of the fact that Patagonia hires the intensely independent—people who “would be considered unemployable in a typical company,” he’s been told by organizational consultants. While he revels in his independent-minded employees, it also presents a management challenge: how to build a collaborative unit all focused on the same goals.</p>
<p class="indent">One tool he uses is the design of the offices. “No one has a private office in our company and everyone works in open rooms with no doors or separations [including Yvon and Malinda]. What we lose in ‘quiet thinking space’ is more than made up for with better communication and an egalitarian atmosphere.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part04_ch08en5"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part04_ch08en5a">5</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">Now take it a step further and consider Admiral Janitorial <a id="page_226"/>Services, the fictional company described in Matthew Kelly’s <em>The Dream Manager</em>. Turnover is high and costly, not surprising for a company staffed by transient workers. What to do? First, find out their biggest struggle. The company assumes that the biggest cause of turnover is pay, but when it surveys the employees it discovers that their biggest struggle is transportation. Many rely on public transportation, which is spotty and even dangerous at night. What should the leaders of the company do? They provide shuttle service. It’s costly, but what they save in turnover costs more than makes up for it. Employees stay twice as long, sick days have dropped, and morale is higher.</p>
<p class="indent">Still, the leaders know they could do better. What really makes people leave? they wonder. The jobs are dead-end ones, not dream-fulfilling positions, and everybody knows it. The leaders decide that they can’t fix that, but they can find ways to help employees move closer to their dreams while they work for Admiral. So they ask the employees, “What are your dreams?” Surprisingly (or maybe not), the employees tell them. Now the company has powerful information—and it uses it to help the employees achieve their dreams. One employee wants to learn Spanish; another, who happens to be a Spanish speaker, wants to teach. So the company connects them.</p>
<p class="indent">Yes, this story is fictional, but does the example seem extreme?</p>
<p class="indent">Why shouldn’t we know what our colleagues, coworkers, friends, and family members dream? How powerful that information would be. How central that information would be for sustaining a course whereby you and those in your sphere of influence achieve what is desired.</p>
<p class="indent">Do you know what motivates the people around you? There are simple ways to find out. And once you have the information, it is a simple process to link your desired outcomes with their goals:</p>
<p class="numberlist"><a id="page_227"/>1. Be sincere. Do not promise anything that you cannot deliver.</p>
<p class="numberlista">2. Be empathetic. Ask yourself what it is the other person really wants.</p>
<p class="numberlista">3. Consider the benefits the person will receive from doing what you suggest.</p>
<p class="numberlista">4. Match those benefits to the other person’s wants.</p>
<p class="numberlista">5. When you make your request, put it in a form that will convey to the other person the idea that he personally will benefit.</p>
<p class="indent1">The more you know of others and the more they know of you, the easier it will be to find common ground on which to base all future creativity and collaboration. Staying connected with customers in the digital world, says Richard Branson, the Virgin Group mogul recently voted Most Influential British Business Figure, is keeping many executives awake at night.</p>
<p class="blockquote1">How companies adapt to this energetic and sometimes chaotic world will define their future success. The website, Facebook page, blog and Twitter feed are no longer add-ons to a business’s communication budget: They should be central to its marketing strategy, and used in coordination with other marketing efforts.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part04_ch08en6"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part04_ch08en6a">6</a></span></p>
<p class="indent1">The key, says Branson, is not defaulting your digital media into mere transactional mode; instead, open them wide for ongoing communication as well. We now live in a connected world where the idea of companies and customers being instantly and constantly in touch is not an exception; it’s the expectation.</p>
<p class="indent">“The rise of social media,” writes Branson,</p>
<p class="blockquote1"><a id="page_228"/>has presented exciting challenges and caused us to question our usual ways of doing business. . . . To succeed, such efforts must be supported from the top. David Cush, CEO of Virgin America, freed up the management of these social media channels from the company’s classic hierarchy. His social media team is made up of 20-somethings who have been given broad guidelines and then let loose.</p>
<p class="indent1">These digital natives at Virgin have employed Facebook and Twitter as part of the company’s communication strategy. This open digital connection allowed for a unique connection opportunity that flowed into a successful marketing campaign.</p>
<p class="indent">Many West Coast animal shelters were bursting at the seams with Chihuahuas, and something needed to be done to give the little dogs a better chance to find good homes. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals intervened, contacting Virgin America and asking if the airline would help fly several dogs from San Francisco to New York. Virgin immediately agreed and even volunteered crew members to accompany the small passengers.</p>
<p class="indent">Virgin’s digital team promoted this story through all their communication channels. “It went viral,” explains Branson, “and also sparked the interest of the traditional media—drawing attention to the ASPCA and Virgin Atlantic’s efforts to help. We then used the story as the basis of a very successful online sale on flights to Mexico.”</p>
<p class="indent">The traditional roles of advertising, marketing, and customer relations have changed. So too has the role of today’s leader. In digital time and space, with open access and frequent communication, the perfunctory principles of corporate activity have largely broken down and been replaced by the basic principles of human relations. If you don’t know how to <a id="page_229"/>win friends and influence people in a genuine and positive manner today, not only will you have trouble keeping pace in a marketplace ruled by the consumer, you will also have trouble keeping your people employed.</p>
<p class="indent">Long gone are the days when leaders can lord it over their reports from behind closed doors in top-floor offices accessible only by private elevators. In truth, those days never existed where effective leadership is concerned—not in 1936 and not now. Today, with full-time connectivity as the norm, the consequences of remote leadership are more palpable. Physical proximity is not the main issue. Relational proximity is.</p>
<p class="indent">While an individual can only occasionally maintain a productive, progressive relationship without a reasonable measure of physical presence, no person in the world—especially a leader—can maintain progressive influence without relational proximity.</p>
<p class="indent">It is true that the world is now open for business, but your first task remains the business of humanity. The greatest endeavors are and always will be interdependent and interactive. In the end, the art of winning friends and influencing people in the digital age is summed up in the activity of connecting and staying connected on common ground.<a id="page_230"/></p>
