<p class="paraspaceabove"><span class="big"><strong>O</strong></span>nly slightly less of a cliché than “The check is in the mail” is this: “The ref blew the call.” While the sport and circumstances vary, referees regularly make mistakes. Occasionally the consequences are significant. Around the world some are so famous they have their own monikers.</p>
<p class="indent">Take the “hand of God” goal, for instance. In the 1986 World Cup quarterfinals, Argentina and England were locked in a scoreless tie when Argentina’s captain, Diego Maradona, leapt high in the air over goalie Peter Shilton and punched the ball into the net. The referee, Ali Bin Nasser, didn’t see the handball and ruled the goal legal.</p>
<p class="indent">Then there was Jeffrey Maier. In the 1996 American League Championship Series, the Orioles led the Yankees 4–3 in the bottom of the eighth inning when Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter hit a long fly ball into right field. The twelve-year-old Maier reached over the wall and caught the ball, preventing Orioles right fielder Tony Tarasco from making the play. Umpire Rich Garcia improperly called a home run instead of an out or automatic double. The Yankees went on to win the game.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"/>Add to these incidents ten thousand other blown calls, and fan exasperation at referee errors can be faintly understood. Certainly we are passionate about our teams. But referees are human, after all, and we can understand making mistakes. What makes exasperation linger, however, is the inability or unwillingness of the referees to admit their mistakes.</p>
<p class="indent">That is what makes one of the worst examples of referee error so extraordinary—and ultimately redeeming.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s been called the “perfect game robbery.” Since 1900—the generally recognized start of baseball’s modern era—nearly four hundred thousand games have been played in the United States. During this span only eighteen times has a pitcher delivered perfection, retiring every opposing batter in order without giving up a walk or a hit and without his teammates putting a runner on base with an error. To put this in perspective, the odds of a perfect game being thrown in baseball (one in twenty thousand) are far smaller than the chance you will be struck by lightning in your lifetime.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch03en1"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch03en1a">1</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">But a perfect game is precisely what Detroit Tigers pitcher Armando Galarraga had happening one early June evening in 2010. He’d recorded twenty-six consecutive outs and had gotten the twenty-seventh batter to tap a weak ground ball to the first baseman. Galarraga ran from the mound, took the throw from the first baseman, tagged the bag ahead of the runner and got ready to celebrate. There was only one problem: the umpire, Jim Joyce, swung his arms wide and shouted, “Safe!”</p>
<p class="indent">Galarraga’s perfect game had been lost in one of the most egregious blown calls in sports history.</p>
<p class="indent">But here is where things took an equally unexpected turn. It is perhaps the most significant and memorable detail of the story.</p>
<p class="indent">When he got back to the umpire’s locker room, Joyce immediately <a id="page_117"/>cued the game video and watched the play—only once. He saw how badly he’d blown the call. But instead of letting the dust settle in silence like so many of his colleagues, Joyce chose a different path. He walked straight to the Detroit Tigers locker room and requested an audience with Galarraga.</p>
<p class="indent">Face red as a tomato, tears in his eyes, he hugged Galarraga and managed to get out two words before dissolving into tears: “Lo siento.”</p>
<p class="indent">He apologized boldly and unreservedly. In doing so he changed sports history. There had been previous perfect games in baseball, but this was the first redemption game.</p>
<p class="indent">There are many things that are common to us all—birth, death, and a lifetime full of mistakes, errors, and gaffes. We all know this, and the vast majority of our mistakes, while temporarily frustrating and even maddening to others, are forgivable.</p>
<p class="indent">Why, then, do we have such a hard time admitting them?</p>
<p class="indent">Take Tiger Woods, for example. His Thanksgiving-night car crash outside his home quickly triggered seemingly endless accusations and allegations of extramarital affairs. Where once rumors of affairs would be passed around town as unsubstantiated gossip, our digital age can broadcast, accuse, and convict almost overnight.</p>
<p class="indent">Woods’s response? A prepared, vague admission of his “transgressions” and a request for privacy. His professional and personal world soon collapsed around him. Sponsors dropped him, his wife left him, and his golf skills suffered greatly.</p>
<p class="indent">Could he have taken a different road? Of course.</p>
<p class="indent">In the first weeks of the breaking news, before the fallout of endorsement deals being cancelled or Woods’s wife’s departure, PR experts pointed to a different approach that could have stopped the bleeding much sooner. In a <em>Phoenix Business Journal</em> <a id="page_118"/>article, journalist Mike Sunnucks cited Abbie Fink of HMA Public Relations:</p>
<p class="blockquote1">Fink said Woods and his camp chose silence over getting in front of a story that ended up being driven by TMZ and the <em>National Enquirer</em>. “In the absence of anything coming from Tiger, the media will go find the sources elsewhere. And after today’s news, it would appear that there are plenty of people willing to share their side of the story,” Fink said.</p>
<p class="blockquote2">Troy Corder, a principal with Critical Public Relations in Phoenix, said the Woods camp made numerous mistakes including essentially lying, hunkering down with a bunker mentality and not being ready to respond to tabloid reports, which have been true in part.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch03en2"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch03en2a">2</a></span></p>
<p class="indent1">A sincere and swift apology, publicly made, would have brought him to earth in the right sort of way. He had been an untouchable icon. A quick and emphatic admission not only would have cleared the air but also would have confirmed to people he was like all of us, human, mistake-prone, and messy—something we all knew anyway. That would have only helped him return to others’ good graces much sooner.</p>
<p class="indent">Digital Royalty CEO Amy Martin observed at the time:</p>
<p class="blockquote1">Tiger should humanize his brand via social media outlets, specifically with Twitter and real-time raw video. His Facebook presence has a polished and promotional tonality leaving fans wanting a glimpse behind-the-scenes. . . . If he had allowed people to see the person behind the superstar personality, perceptions and expectations could have been different in recent events.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch03en3"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch03en3a">3</a></span></p>
<p class="indent1"><a id="page_119"/>Unfortunately, it was not the road Tiger’s team chose after the events that changed the course of his career. And the dust took much longer to settle. Such is the effect of ignoring this principle in the digital age. Negative news spreads faster than ever. If you’ve made a mistake, it is far better that you control the news being spread. Come clean quickly and convincingly.</p>
<p class="indent">One reason we find it so difficult to admit our faults is that we are inclined to forget the messages that apologies bear. This forgetfulness is all the more dangerous today. If we admit our faults immediately and emphatically, it is like shooting a full-page press release across the wires that confirms we genuinely care about the people we hurt, that we are humbled, and that we want to make things right. People rarely hold on to anger and disappointment when they can see that we view ourselves and the situation properly. We are much more forgiving of those who are willing to come clean right away.</p>
<p class="indent">Contrast the public’s view today of baseball slugger Jason Giambi, who immediately and tearfully admitted steroid use as the scandal was coming to light, against former slugger Mark McGwire, who waited five years to clear the air. Giambi had his life back rather quickly. The public was gracious and quick to forgive. While McGwire certainly had his reasons for delaying his explanation, in many baseball fans’ minds he forever wears a scarlet S on his chest. A half decade after his stellar career ended, he still remained a long way off from receiving the Hall of Fame induction that was once a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p class="indent">If we are aloof and ambiguous about our mistakes, we also shoot out a full-page press release, but one that reads: “I would like my life back.” While we’d all like our pre-mistake lives back after a mistake has been made, we have to remember that no one changed the circumstances but us. It is not others’ duty to give <a id="page_120"/>us back the life we took from ourselves. Only we can get our life back. That always begins with admitting our faults quickly and emphatically.</p>
<p class="indent">What all of us at one time or another forget is that there is a certain degree of satisfaction in having the courage to admit one’s errors. It not only clears the air of guilt and defensiveness but also often helps solve the problem created by the error much quicker.</p>
<p class="indent">Ronald Reagan was known as the “Great Communicator” because, to the joy of his supporters and the consternation of his critics, he could move from a place of defensive weakness to undeniable strength with a simple quip.</p>
<p class="indent">One of his tried-and-true methods? An easy familiarity with the apology. During one particularly rocky patch of his presidency, he poked fun at his own White House, conceding, “Our right hand doesn’t know what our far right hand is doing.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch03en4"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch03en4a">4</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">Reagan knew it was easier to bear self-condemnation than condemnation from others. If we know we are going to be rebuked anyhow, isn’t it better to beat the other person to the punch?</p>
<p class="indent">When we recognize and admit our errors, the response from others is typically forgiveness and generosity. Quickly the error is diminished in their eyes. It is only when we shirk responsibility or refuse to admit our errors immediately that we raise the ire of those around us and the original misjudgment seems to grow in importance and negative effect.</p>
<p class="indent">Today we have the opportunity to broadcast our apologies, to let everyone involved know we made an error and are sorry for it. We nip negative opinions in the bud when we take that action. And we gain people’s respect, because it takes courage to admit our faults publicly.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"/>It also takes courage to admit our faults privately. Consider our families. How hard is it for husbands and wives to admit their mistakes to each other? It’s akin to stabbing yourself in the gut. But no matter what that mistake may have been, it is crucial to choose the path of humility and rely on the power of forgiveness.</p>
<p class="indent">Anne was a successful finance executive and mother of three. Honors graduate of an Ivy League school, she’d never really failed at anything. She married the man of her dreams and then one night found herself hanging out with some of her buddies from work while at an out-of-town convention. One drink led to two, and two to four, and the group of buddies got smaller until it was just a male coworker and her.</p>
<p class="indent">They decided to leave the bar, and in the elevator they kissed. A few more floors and footsteps later and they stood outside her hotel room door. She opened it. They kissed again. Then they stopped. He backed away and so did she.</p>
<p class="indent">Each was married; they loved their spouses. They kissed again. And then they stopped, and he left and the door closed behind him. Anne went to bed alone . . . and then woke up to the nightmare that she’d betrayed the man of her dreams.</p>
<p class="indent">She went home two days later and said nothing for six years. It was a mistake. A one-time mistake with only one witness, who wasn’t going to say anything either.</p>
<p class="indent">The years passed with the memory locked away in a mental and emotional safe. She knew that if this secret got out, it would be the end of her life as the one who had it all together, the one who made no mistakes.</p>
<p class="indent">But one evening, while on vacation, she told her husband everything. He looked at her and started crying. Of all the reactions she’d considered, that hadn’t been one of them.</p>
<p class="indent">Over the next several weeks, they talked to each other, to <a id="page_122"/>their friends, and to their pastor. Her husband grieved, and with every minute of his grief her own heart broke. But something else broke as well—her mask of perfectionism. As friends learned of her mistake, she was overwhelmed by the very thing she never considered possible—grace and forgiveness.</p>
<p class="indent">She discovered that the truth did indeed have the power to set her free. Anne’s mistake was not without consequence, but in admitting the mistake and seeking forgiveness, she allowed room for a different perspective on her life, a perspective in which she was safe being imperfect. If only she had given herself room six years sooner.</p>
<p class="indent">The same perspective exists for us all if we are brave enough to own it. Any fool can defend a mistake—and most fools do—but admitting your mistake raises you above the pack and gives you a feeling of exultation.</p>
<p class="indent">At the end of 2010, people in the sports world engaged in that casual end-of-year discussion about whom <em>Sports Illustrated</em> would name as its “Sportsman of the Year.” The honor ended up going to New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees for leading the once hapless Saints to their first-ever Super Bowl victory. It was a fitting selection.</p>
<p class="indent">But Chris Harry of <span class="weblink"><a class="nounder" href="http://AOLnews.com">AOLnews.com</a></span> believed two different men should have shared the prize instead. “As far as sheer sportsmanship, to me, nothing compared to the fallout from the night of June 3.” Harry goes on to recount the now-famous story of the blown perfect game and concludes:</p>
<p class="blockquote1">About 16 hours later, the Tigers and Indians played again, but the meeting that mattered came before the game when Galarraga was tabbed for the trip to home plate to turn in the lineup card. Joyce was waiting for him. The two exchanged handshakes and hugs in one of the most inspiring, emotional <a id="page_123"/>and moving displays of sportsmanship any sport had ever seen. It was a moment worthy of being relived and helped us learn a lesson about invoking class and dignity when circumstances very easily—especially in this day and age—could have brought about a very different reaction.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part03_ch03en5"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part03_ch03en5a">5</a></span></p>
<p class="indent1">Oh, the power of two words to change everything: “Lo siento. I’m sorry.”<a id="page_124"/></p>
