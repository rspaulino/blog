<p class="paraspaceabove"><span class="big"><strong>H</strong></span>ow do you get the job, land the client, increase your influence, and not lose $180 million in market capitalization? Listen.</p>
<p class="indent">In March 2008 the members of a little-known indie band from Canada were on their way to Nebraska to for a weeklong tour. The first leg of their United Airlines flight landed in Chicago. As the guys began to deplane, they heard a woman behind them exclaim, “They’re throwing guitars out there!” They pressed their noses up against the windows to see for themselves. The woman was right; their guitars were being tossed and dropped and tossed again onto the luggage cart.</p>
<p class="indent">One of those guitars, a $3,500 Taylor, belonged to the band’s lead singer, Dave Carroll, who immediately tried telling a flight attendant what was happening.</p>
<p class="indent">On his website he explains she cut him off. “Don’t talk to me,” she said. “Talk to the lead agent outside.”</p>
<p class="indent">He went outside, where another employee never took the time to listen to his complaint. A third employee dismissed him saying, “But hun, that’s why we make you sign the waiver.” He explained that he hadn’t signed a waiver and that no waiver would excuse what many people on the plane had seen. She told him to wait until Omaha to talk to someone.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch04en1"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch04en1a">1</a></span></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72"/>Not surprisingly, when he opened his guitar case he discovered it had been badly damaged. Thus began a yearlong odyssey in which Dave Carroll tried to get someone at United Airlines to listen.</p>
<p class="indent">During those twelve months, every United employee Carroll spoke with told him what to do, but none bothered to listen to him. At one point they told him to bring the guitar to Chicago for inspection. He had long since returned to his home in Canada, some fifteen hundred miles away.</p>
<p class="indent">In the meantime, Carroll had the guitar fixed for $1,200. He was a professional musician and needed the primary tool of the trade. But the sound wasn’t the same.</p>
<p class="indent">He told United he would settle with them for the repair bill. His request fell on deaf ears.</p>
<p class="indent">But a traveling songwriter always has two things: something to say and a means to say it. If United wouldn’t listen, perhaps his music audience would.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch04en2"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch04en2a">2</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">Carroll sat down and wrote a song called “United Breaks Guitars,” and on July 6, 2009, he uploaded a video of it to YouTube. He hoped for a million views in the first year. People listened far more than he anticipated: two weeks after it premiered, the video had nearly four million views. Within days, <em>The</em> <em>Times</em> of London revealed, “the gathering thunderclouds of bad PR caused United Airlines’ stock price to suffer a mid-flight stall, and it plunged by 10%, costing shareholders $180 million. Which, incidentally, would have bought Carroll more than 51,000 replacement guitars.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch04en3"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch04en3a">3</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">The power of listening is the power to change hearts and minds. More consequentially, it is the power of giving people what they most desire—to be heard and understood.</p>
<p class="indent">Seesmic founder Loïc Le Meur maintains that the very idea of online ad campaigns is passé. The key for any and every company <a id="page_73"/>is a “long-term engagement program” that facilitates listening to customers.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch04en4"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch04en4a">4</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">Online ad campaigns have so much promise, though. They can deliver a demographic profile unlike any other medium. Your company wants a twenty-three-year-old female computer programmer who likes basket weaving? There’s almost certainly a site where she can be found. Such profiling has long been the dream of advertisers everywhere. How could this not work?</p>
<p class="indent">It doesn’t work, Le Meur says, because generating impressions or exposure simply isn’t how the world works.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch04en5"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch04en5a">5</a></span> Rather, it works through listening and building up trust. This process is a slow one, but one that will always bear fruit.</p>
<p class="indent">During the darkest hours of the Civil War, Lincoln wrote to an old friend in Springfield, Illinois, asking him to come to Washington. Lincoln said he had some problems he wanted to discuss with him. The old neighbor got to Washington as quickly as he could. Lincoln talked to him for hours about the advisability of issuing a proclamation freeing the slaves. He went over all the arguments for and against such a move, and then read letters and newspaper articles, some denouncing him for not freeing the slaves and others denouncing him for fear he was going to free them. After the long conversation, Lincoln shook hands with his old friend, said goodnight, and sent him back to Illinois without ever asking for his opinion. Lincoln had done all of the talking. But the talking seemed to clarify his mind.</p>
<p class="indent">“He seemed to feel easier after that talk,” the old friend said. Lincoln hadn’t wanted advice. He had wanted a sympathetic, trusted listener to whom he could unburden himself. Ultimately it is what we all seek at one time or another. The question is whether you are discerning enough to be a burden lifter.</p>
<p class="indent">When President Coolidge became vice president, Channing H. Cox succeeded him as governor of Massachusetts and came <a id="page_74"/>to Washington to call on his predecessor. Cox was impressed by the fact that Coolidge was able to see a long list of callers every day and yet finish his work at 5:00 p.m., while Cox found that he was often detained at his desk up to nine o’clock. “How come the difference?” he asked Coolidge. “You talk back,” said Coolidge.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch04en6"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch04en6a">6</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">Listening’s power, like that of smiling, is strong. When you listen well you not only make an instant impression, you also build a solid bridge for lasting connection. Who can resist being around a person who suspends his thoughts in order to value yours?</p>
<p class="indent">Few people in modern times have listened as well as Sigmund Freud. A man who once met him described his manner of listening:</p>
<p class="blockquote1">It struck me so forcibly that I shall never forget him. He had qualities, which I had never seen in any other man. Never had I seen such concentrated attention. There was none of that piercing “soul penetrating gaze” business. His eyes were mild and genial. His voice was low and kind. His gestures were few. But the attention he gave me, his appreciation of what I said, even when I said it badly, was extraordinary. You’ve no idea what it meant to be listened to like that.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch04en7"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch04en7a">7</a></span></p>
<p class="indent1">One might argue that people such as Freud, Lincoln, and others in an age gone by had it easier. Their world was smaller and certainly more controlled. There is some truth to this argument, but not anything that provides us an excuse.</p>
<p class="indent">Yes, our age is broader and far more untamed, but we made it so. And it is therefore we who can make such traits work in our favor. Unfortunately, it seems many haven’t yet figured it out.</p>
<p class="indent">While our circle of influence balloons well beyond our neighbors and work colleagues to encompass, primarily through Facebook, much of our relational history, such an expansive <a id="page_75"/>network that numbers in the hundreds if not the thousands seems to be overwhelming to most. While the number of people to whom we might listen has expanded, the number of people to whom we actually listen is diminishing.</p>
<p class="indent">A recent study profiled in the <em>American Sociological Review</em> reveals that people are growing more socially isolated than they were even twenty years ago:</p>
<p class="blockquote1">Overall, the number of people Americans have in their closest circle of confidants has dropped from around three to about two. . . . Whereas nearly three-quarters of people in 1985 reported they had a friend in whom they could confide, only half in 2004 said they could count on such support. The number of people who said they counted a neighbor as a confidant dropped by more than half, from about 19 percent to about 8 percent.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch04en8"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch04en8a">8</a></span></p>
<p class="indent1">“We’re not saying people are completely isolated,” notes Lynn Smith-Lovin, a Duke University sociologist who helped conduct the study. “They may have 600 friends on Facebook . . . and e-mail 25 people a day, but they are not discussing matters that are personally important.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch04en9"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch04en9a">9</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">More so than when this book was first published in 1936, there is a crying need for people who will make the time to listen, for people who will resist the “skitterish impatience” so prevalent in our age and make people more important than progress. It is of course absurd to believe progress can be made without the fidelity of other people, but we usually don’t see this until other people let us know—with their eyes, with their silence, with their closed wallets.</p>
<p class="indent">There are few new tips that can create a personal or corporate cache of better listening. But there is one principle that, if applied <a id="page_76"/>daily, can reconnect you with others on a lasting level: presence. A martyred spiritual ambassador once framed the principle this way: “Wherever you are, be all there.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch04en10"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch04en10a">10</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">John, an aspiring political writer, understood this principle far earlier in life than his peers. His claim is that he’s never given a bad job interview. For every interview, he’s received an offer. But what is perhaps most interesting is that there has rarely been anything on paper to suggest he was the best fit. “I have, more often than not,” he admits, “been an average prospect on paper.”</p>
<p class="indent">To what, then, does he attribute his uncommon interview success rate? A counterintuitive perspective on interviews. He explains:</p>
<p class="blockquote1">Every interview is a chance to learn something new about people I’ve never met. Think about it; the environment is conducive to it. There’s already a natural give-and-take. In my interviews I’ve learned about everything from culinary tastes to dashed dreams to crazy hopes. People want to be listened to and they want people around who will listen. So I listen. And I’ve found that listening imparts a great deal of respect—more so than any planned speech ever could.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch04en11"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch04en11a">11</a></span></p>
<p class="indent1">So it turns out that listening also garners great respect. And John’s rare interview presence has translated into rare opportunities—he has served as both a CIA agent and a White House speechwriter.</p>
<p class="indent">When asked for suggestions on embodying his level of presence with others, he says his personal goal is to ask fifteen questions per day. The most important five, he explains, are to your family or those in closest proximity to you. Sure, ask about their day. But go deeper. Ask what made them laugh. Or perhaps what made them cry. Ask them about a lesson they learned or a person they met whom they liked.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_77"/>The next five are for the people with whom you work on a regular basis. “The old truth that there are no bad questions may or may not be true in a brainstorming session. It is certainly true when done with sincerity in a conversation with another person. If you ask with respect and interest, you cannot go wrong.”</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, he explains, the last five questions are for your digital space—Facebook, emails, Twitter, and blogs. “Read others’ posts and messages closely; comment or reply with questions, and do it for at least five different people every day. In addition to that, use your posts and updates to ask more questions of your friends and followers. You may be surprised at how many people respond.”</p>
<p class="indent">These are lessons Bob Taylor of Taylor Guitars certainly takes to heart. When he heard that Dave Carroll’s Taylor guitar had been damaged by United Airlines, he called Carroll directly and offered him two guitars of his choice.</p>
<p class="indent">Imagine what might have happened if someone, anyone, at United exercised an ear for how to make things right with David Carroll. If they had, chances are high they would not have had to issue the following statement when Carroll’s video went viral:</p>
<p class="blockquote1">This has struck a chord with us. We are in conversations with one another to make what happened right, and while we mutually agree that this should have been fixed much sooner, Dave Carroll’s excellent video provides United with a learning opportunity that we would like to use for training purposes to ensure all customers receive better service from us.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="part02_ch04en12"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#part02_ch04en12a">12</a></span></p>
<p class="indent1">It is often said that you live and learn, but perhaps an equally important lesson for us all is that if you listen and learn, you live more harmoniously.<a id="page_78"/></p>
