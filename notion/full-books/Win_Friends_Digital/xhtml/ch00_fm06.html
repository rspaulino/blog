<h2 class="h2"><a id="ch00_fm06"/><a id="page_ix"/><span class="AvenirLTStd-Heavy"><strong>Why Carnegie’s Advice Still Matters</strong></span></h2>
<p class="paraspaceabove"><span class="big"><strong>I</strong></span>n 1936, Dale Carnegie made a compelling statement to his readers: “Dealing with people is probably the biggest problem you face.” This is the foundation of <em>How to Win Friends and Influence People,</em> and it is still true today. However, developing strategies for dealing with people is more complex.</p>
<p class="indent">Messaging speed is instantaneous. Communication media have multiplied. Networks have expanded beyond borders, industries, and ideologies. Yet rather than making the principles in this book obsolete, these major changes have made Carnegie’s principles more relevant than ever. They represent the foundation of every sound strategy, whether you are marketing a brand, apologizing to your spouse, or pitching to investors. And if you don’t begin with the right foundation, it is easy to send the wrong message, to offend, or to fall embarrassingly short of your objective. “Precision of communication,” insisted American writer James Thurber, “is important, more important than ever, in our era of hair-trigger balances, when a false, or misunderstood, word may create as much disaster as a sudden thoughtless act.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="ch00_fm06en1"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#ch00_fm06en1a">1</a></span></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_x"/>Consider the era of hair-trigger balances in which we live today, more than fifty years after Thurber penned the phrase. The stakes are higher. Amid the amalgam of media, distinction is more difficult. Every word, every nonverbal cue, every silent stare is scrutinized as it has never been before. One wrong move can have far greater implications. Still, every interaction from your first good morning to your last goodnight is an opportunity to win friends and influence others in a positive way. Those who succeed daily lead quite successful lives. But this sort of success comes at a philanthropic price some aren’t willing to pay. It is not as simple as being ad-wise or savvy about social media.</p>
<p class="indent">“The art of communication is the language of leadership,” said the presidential speechwriter James Humes.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="ch00_fm06en2"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#ch00_fm06en2a">2</a></span> In other words, people skills that lead to influence have as much to do with the messenger—a leader in some right—as with the medium. This book will show you how and why this is true, just as it has shown more than fifty million readers around the globe, including world leaders, media luminaries, business icons, and bestselling authors. What all come to understand is that there is no such thing as a neutral exchange. You leave someone either a little better or a little worse.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="ch00_fm06en3"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#ch00_fm06en3a">3</a></span> The best among us leave others a little better with every nod, every inflection, every interface. This one idea embodied daily has significant results.</p>
<p class="indent">It will improve your relationships and expand your influence with others, yes. But it will do so because the daily exercise elicits greater character and compassion from you. Aren’t we all moved by altruism?</p>
<p class="indent">“You can make more friends in two months by becoming more interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get people interested in you.” Carnegie’s assertion remains relevant, albeit counterintuitive, because it reminds us the secret to progress with people is a measure of selflessness swept under the drift of the digital age.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_xi"/>We live in an unprecedented era of self-help and self-promotion. We watch YouTube videos like the Double Rainbow go viral in a matter of weeks and garner the sort of global attention people used to break their backs for years, even decades, to obtain. We witness allegedly leaked sex videos create overnight celebrities. We watch talking heads and political pundits tear down their competition and elevate their ratings. We are daily tempted to believe that the best publicity strategy is a mix of gimmick and parody run through the most virally proficient medium. The temptation is too much for many. But for those who understand the basics of human relations, there is a far better, far more reputable, far more sustainable way to operate.</p>
<p class="indent">While self-help and self-promotion are not inherently deficient pursuits, problems always arise when the stream of self-actualization is dammed within us. You are one in seven billion—your progress is not meant for you alone.</p>
<p class="indent">The sooner you allow this truth to shape your communication decisions, the sooner you will see that the quickest path to personal or professional growth is not in hyping yourself to others but in sharing yourself with them. No author has presented the path as clearly as Dale Carnegie. Yet perhaps even he could not have imagined how the path to meaningful collaboration would become an autobahn of lasting, lucrative influence today.</p>
<p class="noindents1"><span class="AvenirLTStd-Heavy"><strong>More Than Clever Communication</strong></span></p>
<p class="noindent">While the hyperfrequency of our interactions has made proficient people skills more advantageous than ever, influential people must be more than savvy communicators.</p>
<p class="indent">Communication is simply an outward manifestation of our thoughts, our intentions, and our conclusions about the people around us. “Out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="ch00_fm06en4"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#ch00_fm06en4a">4</a></span> <a id="page_xii"/>These internal drivers are the primary differentiator between today’s leader and today’s relational leech.</p>
<p class="indent">The two highest levels of influence are achieved when (1) people follow you because of what you’ve done for them and (2) people follow you because of who you are. In other words, the highest levels of influence are reached when generosity and trustworthiness surround your behavior. This is the price of great, sustainable impact, whether two or two million people are involved. Yet it is only when generosity and trust are communicated artfully and authentically that the benefits are mutual.</p>
<p class="indent">Because we live in an age when celebrity influence can be borrowed like credit lines and media coverage can be won by squeaky wheels, it is all the more critical that every communication opportunity matter—that every medium you use be filled with messages that build trust, convey gratitude, and add value to the recipients. The one thing that has not changed since Carnegie’s time is that there is still a clear distinction between influence that is borrowed (and is difficult to sustain) and influence that is earned (and is as steady as earth’s axis). Carnegie was the master of influence that is earned.</p>
<p class="indent">Consider a few of his foundational principles—don’t criticize, condemn, or complain; talk about others’ interests; if you’re wrong, admit it; let others save face. Such principles don’t make you a clever conversationalist or a resourceful raconteur. They remind you to consider others’ needs before you speak. They encourage you to address difficult subjects honestly and graciously. They prod you to become a kinder, humbler manager, spouse, colleague, salesperson, and parent. Ultimately, they challenge you to gain influence in others’ lives not through showmanship or manipulation but through a genuine habit of expressing greater respect, empathy, and grace.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_xiii"/>Your reward? Rich, enduring friendships. Trustworthy transactions. Compelling leadership. And amid today’s mass of me-isms, a very distinguishing trademark.</p>
<p class="indent">The original book has been called the bestselling self-help book of all time. From a modern standpoint this is a misnomer. “Self-help” was not a phrase Carnegie used. It was the moniker assigned to the genre created by the blockbuster success of <em>How to Win Friends</em>. The irony is that Carnegie would not endorse all of today’s self-help advice. He extolled action that sprang from genuine interest in others. He taught principles that flowed from an underlying delight in helping others succeed. Were the book recategorized, <em>How to Win Friends</em> would be more appropriately deemed the bestselling soul-help book in the world. For it is the soulish underpinning of the Golden Rule that Carnegie extracted so well.</p>
<p class="indent">The principles herein are more than self-help or self-promotion handles. They are soulful strategies for lasting, lucrative progress in your conversations, your collaborations, your company. The implications are significant.</p>
<p class="indent">By applying the principles you will not only become a more compelling person with more influence in others’ lives; you will fulfill a philanthropic purpose every day. Imagine this effect compounded over the dozens of daily interactions the digital age affords you. Imagine the effect if dozens of people throughout an organization followed suit. Winning friends and influencing people today is no small matter. On the continuum of opportunities, it is your greatest and most constant occasion to make sustainable progress with others. And what success does not begin with relationships?</p>
<p class="noindents1"><a id="page_xiv"/><span class="AvenirLTStd-Heavy"><strong>Starting Soft</strong></span></p>
<p class="noindent">The business community tends to patronize soft skills, as Carnegie’s principles have been called, as if to conclude they are complementary to hard skills at best. This is backward. A permanent paradigm shift is necessary if you want to make the most of your interactions, let alone this book.</p>
<p class="indent">Soft skills such as compassion and empathy drive hard skills such as programming, operations, and design to a rare effectiveness. How? Soft skills link hard skills to operational productivity, organizational synergy, and commercial relevance because all require sound human commitment. Does the hard-skilled manager who sits in lofty obscurity lording over his reports trump the hard-skilled manager who walks among his people, who is known, seen, and respected by his people? While the former might win some success by forcing his hand for a time, his influence is fatally flawed because his power is not bestowed on him by his people. His influence is only a veneer of leverage with a short shelf life.</p>
<p class="indent">In his book <em>Derailed,</em> corporate psychologist Tim Irwin details the downfall of six high-profile CEOs over the last decade. Every downfall was triggered by the executive’s inability to connect with employees on a tangible, meaningful level. In other words, every derailment was the result of a hard skill surplus coupled with a soft skill deficit—corporate savvy minus compelling influence. And such failings are no less our own. Theirs were public, but ours are often as palpable.</p>
<p class="indent">We lose the faith of friends, family members, and others when we follow the steps of relational success without feeding the essence of the relationships—the measuring and meeting of human needs.</p>
<p class="indent">What makes so many well-meaning people get this wrong? <a id="page_xv"/>Perhaps the ethereal nature of soft skills leads us astray. We can lean unilaterally on what is measurable.</p>
<p class="indent">Hard skills can be tested, taught, and transferred. Most business books are written with this in mind because we can pinpoint hard skill progress—individually and corporately—with charts, metrics, and reports.</p>
<p class="indent">Not so of soft skills. They can be difficult to reduce to steps. They are often messy and only crudely quantifiable through better responses and improved relationships. Yet aren’t these the best measurements of all? What good is a list of accomplishments if they have led to relational regress? When any progress is bookended by self-promotion and self-indulgence, it will not last.</p>
<p class="indent">On a small scale, do we keep friends whose actions regularly demonstrate the relationship is about them? When we learn a person’s behavior has an ulterior motive, he has less influence with us than someone we’ve met only once. The relationship is doomed unless he confesses and makes a change. Even then, a residue of skepticism will remain.</p>
<p class="indent">On a large scale, do we remain loyal to brands that regularly demonstrate either an inability or an unwillingness to embrace our needs and desires? Gone are the days when the majority of companies tell consumers what they need. We live in a day when consumers hold the majority on design, manufacturing, and marketing decisions. “Going green” was once a small, well-meaning ad campaign for a handful of products. The collective consumer voice has made it a mandatory marketing mantra.</p>
<p class="indent">Individuals and companies insensitive to soft skill success miss the mark today.</p>
<p class="indent">Some insist you can’t teach soft skill instincts. It is true if you approach soft skills with a hard skill methodology. Carnegie didn’t make this mistake. He discovered that altruistic instincts rise to the surface not from shrewd step-by-step strategy but <a id="page_xvi"/>from the exercising of core desires. When we behave in ways that befriend and positively influence others, we tap a deeper well of inspiration, meaning, and resourcefulness.</p>
<p class="indent">Hardwired into all of us is the desire for honest communication—to understand and be understood. Beyond that, for authentic connection—to be known, accepted, and valued. Beyond that still, for successful collaboration—to work together toward meaningful achievement be it commercial success, corporate victory, or relational longevity. The crowning essence of success lies along a spectrum between authentic human connection (winning friends) and meaningful, progressive impact (influencing people). “There is no hope of joy,” concluded the French aviator and writer Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, “except in human relations.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="ch00_fm06en5"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#ch00_fm06en5a">5</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">How does one access these soulful skills that power effective communication, meaningful connection, and progressive collaboration?</p>
<p class="indent">We must first remember that today’s relational successes are not measured on the scale of media—which ones to use and how many friends, fans, or followers one can accumulate. They are measured on the scale of meaning. Become meaningful in your interactions and the path to success in any endeavor is simpler and far more sustainable. The reason? People notice. People remember. People are moved when their interactions with you always leave them a little better.</p>
<p class="indent">Meaning rules the effectiveness of every medium. Once you have something meaningful to offer, you can then choose the most proficient media for your endeavor. However, when you put the medium before the meaning, your message is in danger of becoming, in the words of Shakespeare’s Macbeth, “a tale, told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="ch00_fm06en6"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#ch00_fm06en6a">6</a></span> The advent of tweets and status updates, while providing convenient ways to keep friends, family, and colleagues in the loop, have <a id="page_xvii"/>created an onslaught of such sound and fury. But it is not only the messages going out at 140 characters or less that are at risk of signifying nothing. Any medium carrying a message that lacks meaning will fall short of its intention: a television ad, a department memo, a client email, a birthday card.</p>
<p class="indent">With so few media in his day, Carnegie didn’t need to thoroughly address both sides of this equation. He could focus on how to be meaningful in person, on the phone, and in letters. Today, we must thoroughly consider both the meanings and the media of our messages.</p>
<p class="noindents1"><span class="AvenirLTStd-Heavy"><strong>Straightforward Advice for Succeeding with People Today</strong></span></p>
<p class="noindent">“Simple truths,” wrote the French essayist Vauvenargues, “are a relief from grand speculations.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="ch00_fm06en7"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#ch00_fm06en7a">7</a></span> The reason <em>How to Win Friends and Influence People</em> remains a top seller to this day, moving more than 250,000 units in the United States alone in 2010, is that the principles within it are simple yet timeless. The underlying wisdom is straightforward yet transcendent. Since the inception of Carnegie’s first course on the subject in 1912, his simple truths have illuminated the most effective ways to become a person others look to for opinions, advice, and leadership.</p>
<p class="indent">If there is therefore any opportunity in rewriting the classic tome, it is not in the context of supplanting its advice. The prose threaded through the pages before you is in a different context: reframing Carnegie’s advice for a wholly different era—the same timeless principles viewed through a modern lens and applied with digital, global mind-set. The opportunities to win friends and influence people today are exponentially greater than they were in Dale Carnegie’s time. Yet when you break <a id="page_xviii"/>the opportunities down the numbers matter little because “the entire universe, with one trifling exception, is [still] composed of others.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="ch00_fm06en8"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#ch00_fm06en8a">8</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">It is true, writes <em>50 Self-Help Classics</em> author Tom Butler-Bowdon of <em>How to Win Friends,</em> that “there is a strange inconsistency between the brazenness of the title and much of what is actually in the book.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="ch00_fm06en9"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#ch00_fm06en9a">9</a></span> View this book’s title through today’s skeptical lens and you might miss its magic. The book is above all a treatise on applying the unmatched combination of authentic empathy, strategic connection, and generous leadership.</p>
<p class="indent">It is important to remember that in Carnegie’s time the many media of veneered identities (websites, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter) and gimmick-laden persuasion (pop-up ads, celebrity endorsements, televangelism) were not around. The idea of winning friends had not been reduced to an “accept” button. The idea of influencing people did not include the baggage of a half century’s worth of inflated ad campaigns, corporate deception, and double-living luminaries. Carnegie had an intuitive reason for identifying his title the way he did.</p>
<p class="indent">Back then, if you didn’t foster a friendship, influencing a person was nearly impossible. Social media didn’t exist. Digital connections were not available. In fact, you rarely did business with a person you did not know in a tangible way. The average person had only three ways to connect with another: face-to-face, by letter, or by telephone. Face-to-face was the expectation. Today it is the exception.</p>
<p class="indent">While indirect influence via celebrity or social status existed in Carnegie’s time, it was neither instant nor viral like it is today. Friendship was once the bridge to everyday sway. You earned friends with the firm shake of a hand, a warm smile, and an altruistic body of activity. You were worthy of the influence that resulted. The cause and effect are not so tidy today.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_xix"/>Consider the 2010 issue of <em>Time</em> magazine’s “100 Most Influential People in the World.” With more than six million Twitter followers, Lady Gaga made the list.<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="ch00_fm06en10"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#ch00_fm06en10a">10</a></span> There is no need to discuss whether she has influence over her massive fan base, which has since climbed over 10 million. If she nods to a certain brand of shoes or a certain bottle of water, the products move. The real discussion surrounds the value she ascribes to her relationships and to what end her influence leads. Should she seek the highest measure of both, her influence is a significant force. Should she seek only to increase the numbers, she will make more money but have no more impact than a crack Polaroid campaign.</p>
<p class="indent">The inherent, relational value of influence has not changed. It is still the currency of interpersonal progress. Yet the plethora of communication media has made it possible to acquire dime-store versions. And you get what you pay for.</p>
<p class="indent">While we live in an era when “noise plus naked equals celebrity,” this is not a book about soliciting friendships and exploiting influence, a path Carnegie described as originating “from the teeth out.”<span class="c-tx-sup"><a id="ch00_fm06en11"/><a class="nounder" href="part04_ch09.html#ch00_fm06en11a">11</a></span> This is a human relations handbook that originates “from the heart out.” It is about winning friends the way your good grandfather won your wise grandmother’s heart—through sincere interest, heartfelt empathy, and honest appreciation. And it is about guiding the lasting influence that arises toward mutual progress and benefit.</p>
<p class="indent">There is a right and effective way to do this, and Carnegie depicted it superbly. Seventy-five years later, the principles remain true, but some definitions have changed and ramifications have expanded. The trajectory of this book will thus be toward new explanation and application. How do we understand and utilize Carnegie’s principles in a digitized world? Certain clues can be derived from lists that didn’t exist in Carnegie’s time, <a id="page_xx"/>such as <em>Forbes</em> magazine’s “World’s Most Admired Companies,” the <em>Harvard Business Review</em>’s “Best-Performing CEOs in the World,” and <em>Time</em>’s “100 Most Influential People” list, already mentioned. These clues, or at times warnings, have served as occasional guides for the context in which interpersonal success is achieved today. In the spirit of the original book, the pages that follow will also serve as a constant reminder that the reasons we do things are more important than the things we do.</p>
<p class="indent">While the journey to applying Carnegie principles today is not as complicated as unplugging and returning to a reliance on telegrams, telephones, and tangible interface, it is also not as trite as injecting a little humanity into every aspect of your digital space. In general, the best practice is a judicious blend of personal touch and digital presence.</p>
<p class="indent">Employing this blend begins with an honest assessment of your current situation. From here your path to progress with others is clear.</p>
<p class="indent">What is your ratio of face-to-face versus digital interactions? For most people, email, texts, blogs, tweets, and Facebook posts are the primary ways they correspond with others. This presents new hurdles and new opportunities.</p>
<p class="indent">By relying so heavily on digital communication, we lose a critical aspect of human interactions: nonverbal cues. When delivering bad news, it is difficult to show compassion and support without putting your hand on another’s shoulder. When explaining a new idea, it is difficult to convey the same level of enthusiasm through a phone call as you would if standing before your audience in person. How many times have you sent an email and had the recipient call you to clear the air when the air was already clear?</p>
<p class="indent">Emotion is difficult to convey without nonverbal cues. The advent of video communication has knocked down some barriers, <a id="page_xxi"/>but video is only a small fraction of digital communication. And still it does not shepherd the highest standard of human dignity the way a face-to-face meeting can. The award-winning film <em>Up in the Air</em> makes this point.</p>
<p class="indent">Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) is a corporate downsizer flown around the country to fire people for companies who won’t do it themselves. Bingham excels at his job, which requires him to lay people off in a dignified, even inspiring manner. He has mastered a speech in which he encourages each person to embrace the new freedom. He even fights against his boss, who requires him to begin delivering layoffs via videoconference to decrease expenses. The great paradox, however, is that Bingham is a loner without one authentic relationship in his life, not even with his baby sister, whose wedding he may not attend. What appears to be an uncanny ability to empathize and connect with those he is firing is actually a confirmation of profound detachment. It is not until a personal experience shows him the raw significance of real human connection that he finally sees the truth. Then even he cannot follow his advice.</p>
<p class="indent">We live in a driven, digital world where the full value of human connection is often traded for transactional proficiency. Many have mastered the ironic art of increasing touch points while simultaneously losing touch. The remedy is found neither in self-preservation (à la Ryan Bingham) nor in stimulating connection through stirring but shallow salesmanship. The former is a philosophical blunder. The latter is a strategic one.</p>
<p class="indent">There is a threshold to today’s productivity, found at the very point where progress with people is supplanted by progress. Often it’s the sheer speed of communication that affects our judgment. Because we believe others expect immediate responses (as we do ourselves), we often don’t take the time to craft meaningful responses; we ignore the niceties of common <a id="page_xxii"/>courtesy; we say, “I can’t possibly apply these principles to a blog comment, to an email, at a virtual conference where I’m not even sure I can be heard.” But these interactions are when Carnegie’s principles are most valuable. It is in the common, everyday moments where altruistic actions most clearly stand out.</p>
<p class="indent">We expect courtesy on first dates and follow-up meetings; we are impacted when the same courtesy shows up in a weekly progress report or a shared ride in the elevator. We expect humble eloquence in an ad campaign or a wedding speech; we are inspired when the same humble eloquence shows up in an email update or a text reply on a trivial matter. The difference, as they say, is in the details—the often subtle details of your daily interactions.</p>
<p class="indent">Why do such details still matter in this digital age? Because “the person who has technical knowledge plus the ability to express ideas, to assume leadership and to arouse enthusiasm among people—that person is headed for higher earning power.” It is remarkable how much more relevant Carnegie’s words are today.</p>
