<p class="BODY_Intro-Bio-First-Paragraph" style=";color:black;">
<span class="AllCaps-Bold _idGenCharOverride-1" style=";color:black;">Osi Imeokparia</span>
 is a VP at Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) where she leads the technology teams for the Justice &amp; Opportunity Initiative. Most recently prior to CZI, she was the chief product officer for the Hillary for America presidential campaign. Before working in philanthropy or on political campaigns, she was a product leader at Google working on ad tech platforms like Google AdWords and DoubleClick. She began her career in product at a venture-backed consumer startup before moving on to product roles at eBay.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1076" style=";color:black;"></a>
 How did you get into product management?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When I was at Stanford, I participated in the Mayfield Fellow Program, which is a twelve month entrepreneurship program done in partnership with VCs. This opened my eyes to product management, and I then joined a startup at graduation.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I learned an incredible amount through reading as well as trial and error, but my coworkers and I were all new to PM. I felt like I didn&apos;t really have a solid foundation of skills. So when the company started to go bust, I decided to go to eBay, where I knew there were operationally excellent product managers.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1077" style=";color:black;"></a>
 What was it like at eBay?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I was surprised to see that I knew more than my impostor syndrome had allowed me to believe. I&apos;d learned a bunch at the startup but hadn&apos;t realized it because I didn&apos;t get positive reinforcement that told me I was doing it right.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">At eBay, I could see the progress I&apos;d made, and I could also learn from my incredible colleagues. The VP of Engineering at that time ran an incredibly tight operational ship where we&apos;d launch in 23 companies and across a dozen languages at a time.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I eventually left because I wanted to go live in New York. I had the good fortune to start working at the Google New York office. My first role was in ad tech and I worked on ad tech for 7 Â½ of the almost 10 years I was at Google.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1078" style=";color:black;"></a>
 How was being a PM at eBay different from Google?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">At the time, eBay and Google had very different approaches to products.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">With eBay, it was much more of a business-driven product management approach, where you would do things like write the business case and work with your business partners to figure out the actual revenue opportunity.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">At Google, our collaboration was much more around finding the interesting tech problems. Technology and engineering were much more the center of how decisions and products were launched at Google.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The other material difference is that eBay was a consumer company and the work I did with the Google ads team, DoubleClick acquisition, and larger agency products were enterprise product management.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1079" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Tell me more about your time at Google, and how you moved on after that.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">At Google, I ended up finding my role as the fix-it person. I went where I could be the most useful. I paid attention to which products the executives were asking for help on. That&apos;s how I ended up on the DoubleClick acquisition team, which then led to a big opportunity leading an ad server. A bit of that was also driven by the fact that I was in New York and not in Mountain View. Being in a distributed office, my value-add was filling in where there was a need.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The last product that I worked on at Google was in an autonomous unit called &quot;help out.&quot; We were trying to start a new consumer brand within Google. It ultimately failed, but it was an incredible opportunity to not only be the product lead but also the team lead.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Finally, after about a decade at Google, I left to join the Hillary Clinton campaign as Chief Product Officer in 2015.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1080" style=";color:black;"></a>
 What does PM work for a political campaign look like?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It was <span class="CharOverride-1">nothing</span>
 like anything that I&apos;ve done before, and at the same time it was <span class="CharOverride-1">everything</span>
 like things I&apos;d done before.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">One of the things that was most surprising was that a lot of the muscles that you use in commercial product management are the same ones that are necessary to deliver products on a political campaign. You were just doing it under much tighter time constraints with way less control. That was both surprising and relieving.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">That experience opened my eyes to the ways in which a lot of skills that we have as product managers are applicable across domains. Particularly for me, what I found most compelling was the question of &quot;How can I use product management skills in a civic tech and social impact space?&quot;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">That&apos;s what landed me at Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), which is where I am now.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1081" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Tell me more about your work at CZI.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I currently lead the technology team for our justice and opportunity initiative, which covers three main programmatic areas: criminal justice reform, immigration reform and housing affordability. We partner closely with our programmatic and domain experts to shape and understand the &quot;theory of change&quot; for making an impact in those three spaces.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">For example, our theory of change for criminal justice could be that decarceration is an important long-term outcome to have, and the lever that&apos;s going to help us get there the fastest is by understanding how prosecutors make decisions in this system and then changing that culture and practice of prosecutorial decision-making. The domain experts figure out the strategy and theory of change. My job as the tech lead is to figure out how tech can help support that theory of change, scale that theory of change, or drive more adoption and understanding and awareness of that theory of change.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1082" style=";color:black;"></a>
 How is social impact work different from other PM work?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There are several ways that social impact work is different.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The way we envision our role at Chan Zuckerberg, our principles are very invested in system change. When you&apos;re thinking about changing the 50 year embedded history of criminal justice behaviors, it&apos;s going to have a long arc. The work that you put into the world today might not have an outcome that you can measure for five to ten years. The pace and the feedback loops are very different from commercial product management.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When you&apos;re dealing with social impact, you&apos;re dealing with vulnerable communities. You&apos;re dealing with dynamics of power and inclusion and exclusion. You have to be really thoughtful about how you approach conversations, how you approach partnerships, and how you lift up voices that might not otherwise have a seat at the table. Again, that&apos;s a very different set of concerns than you would have as a product manager for the AdWords dashboard.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There are big dimensions of how this work is different from what I did in the past, but just like on the campaign, surprisingly, a lot of the same muscles apply. One of the great things about product management is the skill sets that you learn are so durable, in so many different spaces. It allows you to flex in a way that I find really rewarding. You can show up in a lot of different ways and have an impact.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1083" style=";color:black;"></a>
 How might a PM know if social impact work is a good match for them?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You don&apos;t know until you try. Trying could be working with a nonprofit in your spare time. There&apos;s no shortage of nonprofits and things they need help with. I see a lot of people finding it hard to imagine where they might be useful, but there is no shortage of need. That&apos;s a really interesting market failure that somebody should fix.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There&apos;s a ton of need in the nonprofit and social impact space for people with technology skills, and specifically with product management skills. Find an issue that you&apos;re interested in and call an organization that works on the issue. 99% of the time, there will be a need for a person with technical skills to fill.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There is benefit and power and necessity in having people flow between the domains of social impact work and the commercial side. The best outcome is to have professionals that move across the two fluidly. They&apos;ll get robust and rich professional experience because the problem spaces are very different. The work that we do in social impact would not be possible if not for the contributions of engineers and technologists creating products like Stripe and <a id="_idIndexMarker884"></a>
 AWS. There is a symbiosis.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1084" style=";color:black;"></a>
 What advice would you give to PMs who want to advance in their careers?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Never feel like you&apos;re too good to do something. No matter how seasoned you are in your career, or how long you&apos;ve been at a company, you should never feel like it&apos;s not your job. When you&apos;re in management, if necessary, you should roll up your sleeves and get stuff done. That opens up paths that you might not have been thinking of.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As an example, at Google I helped some leaders with a roadmap process. The work was basically spreadsheet gymnastics and it didn&apos;t seem ideal for how far I was into my career. But, I was making myself useful. That got me exposure to start working on larger agency products for AdWords.</p>
