<span class="AllCaps-Bold _idGenCharOverride-1">&quot;What got you</span>
 here won&apos;t get you there.&quot; It&apos;s a common refrain we heard from product executives about the move into management.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">

<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Priyanka was a well-loved, results-oriented, hard-working PM who cared about all of the people on her team and worked hand-in-hand with them to solve any problem that came up. She seemed like an obvious choice for management, but soon ran into issues.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As a PM, she was willing to do whatever it took to ship a successful product. She looked into every detail, joined every user session, and triaged every bug. As a manager, she tried to stay as closely involved, but got complaints about <a id="_idIndexMarker545"></a>
 micromanaging. The better PMs tried to switch to other teams where they&apos;d have more <a id="_idIndexMarker546"></a>
 autonomy.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Things weren&apos;t any better with the PMs who were struggling. As a PM, she was careful to never blame her teammates when things went wrong. As a manager, she didn&apos;t hold people accountable; after all, weren&apos;t they all in this together? Unfortunately, at review time, they were quite surprised to hear they were missing expectations.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There were more problems when she worked with other company leaders. People loved the way she advocated for her team when she was a PM. At the leadership strategy session, however, she was called myopic for protesting an important pivot that would cancel one of her team&apos;s projects.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In many ways, success as a PM manager is the same as success for an IC PM—shipping great products by leading a team of people. As a PM manager, you&apos;re just working through one more layer of people. The leadership skills from <a href="text00028.html#_idTextAnchor524">(see Part F: Leadership Skills)</a>
 are as important as ever.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In a few ways though, as Priyanka learned, people management requires new, different leadership skills. Your official role changes your relationship with coworkers. Your scope expands to more teams, more strategy and a longer time horizon. To succeed in your new role, you&apos;ll need to develop your reports to take over your old responsibilities so that you can continue to expand even more.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor732" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Responsibilities</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor733"></a>
 See yourself as a member of the leadership team <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As a people manager, it can be tempting to direct your attention downward and focus on being the best possible manager for your reports. You&apos;ll remember all of your own past managers and what you liked and didn&apos;t like and want to make your reports love you. You&apos;ll want to shelter them from unpleasant directives, defend them in conflicts, and never change plans on them when they&apos;re in the middle of a project.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">That might sound nice in theory, but there&apos;s much more to management than getting stellar reviews from your reports. As a manager, you need to work with other leaders to create great outcomes across the entire company. You are more <a id="_idIndexMarker547"></a>
 accountable to the teams above you than the teams below you.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Sometimes you will need to change plans on people and waste their work. Sometimes you&apos;ll ask one of your teams to set aside their own goals to help another team. You might need to defend a company policy to your reports, even if you personally disagree with it.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">To succeed, you&apos;ll need to invest in your relationship with other leaders at the company. If you&apos;ve found yourself in conflict with one of them in the past, now is the time to be the bigger person and step up to resolve it, for the good of both of your teams.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor734"></a>
 You speak on behalf of the company</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When you are a manager, you&apos;re in a position of authority and your words carry more weight than they did before.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Imagine you&apos;re attending a meeting of your company&apos;s employee group for women. People are discussing that the new member of the executive team is a man. &quot;I&apos;m not surprised,&quot; you say, &quot;This company only promotes men.&quot; As an IC, that comment would just be a complaint about the company&apos;s past behavior. As a manager, however, people in the room might construe it as an admission of discrimination. One of your reports, who was in the room, might sue the company stating that her boss told her only men could be promoted.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This isn&apos;t saying you should condone bad behavior, but you shouldn&apos;t speak carelessly around ICs, especially those who report to you. Even friendly teasing that was fine between peers can become scary when it comes from the person who determines your paycheck.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor735"></a>
 Hold people <a id="_idIndexMarker548"></a>
 accountable <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As a manager, you need to foster accountability in your team. This means ensuring your reports follow through on their commitments, and if they miss their commitments, they explain why and take steps to do better next time. This doesn&apos;t mean that people need to be punished for missing a launch date; rather, that mistakes are taken seriously and learned from so that things can run more smoothly the next time.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The <a id="_idIndexMarker549"></a>
 Five Whys process <a href="text00011.html#_idTextAnchor167">(see Five Whys in Chapter 6)</a>
 is a great way to foster <a id="_idIndexMarker550"></a>
 accountability on your team. When OKRs are missed or other problems pop up, you can ask the PM to run a Five Whys and report back to you with what they learned, and what steps they&apos;re taking to avoid the problem in the future. The formalized steps help keep the conversation away from unproductive blame and towards future learning.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">More generally, you can ask people to explain their actions and thought processes. Set up processes to ensure people do <a id="_idIndexMarker551"></a>
 retrospectives for launches. Follow up with people when you notice something surprising. Ask people whether they are on track to hit each of their goals. If they are off track, ask what their plan is for getting back on schedule.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor736"></a>
 Set strategy for your team <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As a manager, you&apos;ll rely on other people to execute your strategy. You need to find a way to divide the components of your strategy so multiple PMs can work on it at the same time. Here are some tips for approaching strategy as a manager:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Write your strategy in a way that connects the dots between the company&apos;s higher-level strategy and the strategies for the teams under you. For example, if the company has ten priorities, you might own one of those priorities and write a strategy for it. You could then break it down into five initiatives and assign each initiative to a team.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Be intentional about how teams will build on your strategy. Create clear places for them to carve out their own strategic approach while staying aligned with your intentions.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Treat your reports like stakeholders in your strategy. Give them a chance to give their input before it&apos;s finalized. Reinforce that anything they intend to work on will need to connect to the strategy, so they should speak up if anything is missing.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Be clear about prioritization, especially with peers and your own manager. If high priority work is falling behind, you might be able to reallocate resources from lower priority work on another one of your teams. Ensure teams clearly understand what work is high priority and why.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">For more on strategy, read <a href="text00021.html#_idTextAnchor403">Part E: Strategic Skills</a>
 .</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor737"></a>
 Keep your teams connected to the strategy <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Creating a strategy isn&apos;t enough. You need to ensure that strategy is understood and followed. Small misunderstandings can cause big problems: wasted work, missed priorities, misaligned product decisions, and decreased morale.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You&apos;ll need to repeat the strategy more often than you&apos;d think. Take every opportunity to connect things back to the strategy. State what part of the strategy you&apos;re using when you make decisions. Remind teams how their project connects to the strategy. Talk about the strategic impact when you celebrate wins.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">OKRs <a href="text00027.html#_idTextAnchor519">(see OKRs in Chapter 18)</a>
 are a powerful tool to connect strategy to execution. Review each team&apos;s OKRs and don&apos;t settle until you&apos;re happy with them. You&apos;ll want to ensure that they are ambitious enough to make good progress towards the company&apos;s larger goals that you&apos;re responsible for.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor738"></a>
 Review and approve work <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Early in your career, you brought your work to someone else for approval. Now, you&apos;re on the other side. <span class="CharOverride-1">You&apos;re</span>
 the one who&apos;s responsible for ensuring the quality of your team&apos;s products.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You&apos;ll need to empower your team and ensure quality. The PMs who report to you are experts in their area and are much closer to the research, customers, and problems than you are. On the other hand, you probably have more experience, judgment, and bigger-picture context.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As a manager you&apos;ll review more work than you did as an IC—not just designs and working products, but also early specs and strategies as well. The best practices you learned while giving <a id="_idIndexMarker552"></a>
 feedback to designers and engineers still apply:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Set goals and define what success looks like. Your team is responsible for the solution.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Frame your feedback in terms of principles rather than personal preference.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Review the work to ensure it meets the success criteria.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Be aware that as a manager, your words carry more weight. People may feel less comfortable pushing back on your ideas or may accidentally interpret a casual comment as a direct order. The Do, Try, Consider Framework <a href="text00041.html#_idTextAnchor750">(see The &quot;Do, Try, Consider&quot; framework for product feedback in Chapter 28)</a>
 can help clarify intentions.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor739"></a>
 Obsolete yourself <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Delegating is always an important skill, but as an IC, there are limits to how much you can delegate without getting into the territory of not doing your job. As a manager, the more you can delegate effectively, the more you can focus on higher-level responsibilities.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The advice in <a href="text00020.html#_idTextAnchor387">&quot;Learn how to delegate well&quot; in Chapter 13</a>
 applies here, but now you have even more flexibility.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Make sure to consider these options:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Coach and train your reports to grow into bigger responsibilities.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Hire new people who are capable of owning those responsibilities.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Become more tolerant of &quot;mistakes.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Many leaders hold on to responsibilities for too long because they don&apos;t feel like they can trust anyone else to do a good enough job. By hoarding responsibilities, they become a bottleneck and slow down dozens, or even hundreds of people. Start by delegating the types of work where a mistake would be tolerable or reversible.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor740" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Growth Practices</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor741"></a>
 Build up a support network <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Management can be isolating; your reports see you as &quot;the boss&quot; and your manager expects you to be independent. You might be surprised that you&apos;re no longer invited to hang out on the weekend, and that people are more cautious when speaking with you. You can&apos;t talk as openly about the challenges you&apos;re facing since they&apos;re often private.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Management is also emotionally taxing. Your reports might cry in <a id="_idIndexMarker553"></a>
 1:1s. They might be mad at you when they don&apos;t get allocated to the projects they want or don&apos;t get the raises they thought they deserved. You&apos;ll hear about the difficult situations people are facing in their personal lives. You&apos;ll feel responsible for the people on your team, and it might sometimes keep you up at night.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">By intentionally seeking out mentors and peers to connect with, you won&apos;t be alone when you need help or empathy. Look for people with whom you can speak openly—for example, other managers at your company or a professional coach. You might also want to find people who are facing the same types of challenges as you, some who are a little ahead of you, and some who are much more experienced.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor742"></a>
 Maintain authenticity <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You don&apos;t have to put on a big show about being the boss when you become a manager.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You&apos;ll be able to build up trust and have the most impact with the people who report to you if they feel like you&apos;re authentic and they can connect with you. One way to do this is to be open about your own failings and struggles.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor743"></a>
 Set healthy boundaries <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Some managers get so caught up in the idea of being a good and supportive boss that they fail to set important, healthy boundaries. They&apos;ll listen to an employee complaining about a new policy for hours or blame themselves when that employee ignores their <a id="_idIndexMarker554"></a>
 feedback. They might make excuses for rudeness or disrespect.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This kind of permissiveness tends to backfire. First, it takes away your time and energy that could be better spent elsewhere. Second, it encourages bad behavior in your direct reports that will eventually limit their career growth.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">If you find yourself upset with one of your reports, that&apos;s a sign that you need to set boundaries.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You can limit the time you spend discussing a topic and end meetings that cross your boundaries. You can give your reports feedback that they&apos;re not taking responsibility for their own problems, pushing back on policies too much, being disrespectful, or that they&apos;re not taking feedback well.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It can feel uncomfortable, at first, to stand up for yourself in this way. It may help to imagine you were setting the boundaries for someone else on your team, not just yourself. You can also write and share a list of cultural expectations so that you have something official to help you feel justified in enforcing the boundaries.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor744"></a>
 Avoid <a id="_idIndexMarker555"></a>
 micromanaging <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Just because you&apos;re accountable for the work doesn&apos;t mean you should start micromanaging. Great PMs do not want to be micromanaged, so if you want to build a strong team, you need to give people <a id="_idIndexMarker556"></a>
 autonomy.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As a manager, it helps to reflect on where you can tolerate mistakes or solutions that are different from what you would have done. If the answer is &quot;nowhere,&quot; then you&apos;ll be forced to micromanage.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Instead, consider letting your team learn things for themselves:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Usability tests and small <a id="_idIndexMarker557"></a>
 A/B tests are safe places to experiment.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Work that&apos;s validated by a usability or A/B test can usually go out without too much extra review.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">For easily reversible changes, you can measure the success after launch to see if changes are necessary.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Often a range of solutions could be acceptable, rather than requiring the absolute best one.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you get stuck, remember that it&apos;s okay to tell them <span class="CharOverride-1">what</span>
 the solution needs to achieve, just not <span class="CharOverride-1">how</span>
 to do it.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor745"></a>
 Be intentional about <a id="_idIndexMarker558"></a>
 velocity <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As a manager, many of your decisions can affect the velocity of people on your teams.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You can increase velocity by hiring talented people, training them well, setting up product principles, creating a design system, and validating ideas early.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you send a team back to iterate more before moving forward, that decreases velocity. That can be okay—after all, it doesn&apos;t matter how fast you go if you&apos;re heading in the wrong direction.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">However, you need to be mindful of the delays you cause when you ask for more iteration. Only ask for this when you think the improvement will be worth the delay.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor746"></a>
 Ensure that your reports feel full ownership over their work <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You want to ensure that the people on your team feel full ownership and responsibility over their work, even if you&apos;re the one who is ultimately accountable. You won&apos;t be able to scale your influence without it.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Adam Thomas, a principal at Approaching One and product leader, puts it this way:</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">You have no way of being more knowledgeable than the PMs on your team, so any traditional advice about the work itself is generally useless. Your job is to help them make better/faster decisions and step out of the way.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">One way to put this into action is with the way you frame your questions. Presume that they are aware and on top of things. Instead of asking &quot;You should find out how our competitors handle this,&quot; ask, &quot;How do our competitors handle this?&quot;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Ask questions to validate their assumptions. For example, you might ask, &quot;How many people used that feature?&quot; if you think it&apos;s important for the decision, or &quot;Did that analysis slice by active and inactive accounts?&quot; if you think they might have mistakenly not excluded inactive accounts.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As much as possible, treat your reports like the owners of the problem and yourself as an advisor. Even when you do know more than they do, don&apos;t let them rely on your knowledge rather than building up their own.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor747"></a>
 Look out for decisions with broad or long-term impact <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You need to step in when the fallout from a decision goes beyond the scope the team is responsible for. In these cases, you might need to ask for extra validation. In extreme cases, you might need to veto a decision.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here are a few situations where the decision might go beyond the scope of the team:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Hard to reverse</span>
 : Could the decision impact the company&apos;s reputation? Would it be so expensive to change after launch that the team couldn&apos;t change it on their own without missing their other goals?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Long-term costs</span>
 : Most teams can plan three months out, but beyond that, they can&apos;t judge the feasibility of future plans. For example, they might say that they can rewrite a solution to be more scalable in a year, but you know the scalability will be needed sooner.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Cross-team impact</span>
 : When the decisions of one team impact another team, you might need to moderate. This is common when there are dependencies.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Consistency</span>
 : Each team might make decisions that make sense in isolation but add up to an inconsistent and confusing experience for users. Engineers might want to build their own infrastructure to optimize for their own use, but from a higher-level perspective, that&apos;s not the best use of engineering time.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Again, empowering your teams and delegating to them is valuable. But, there&apos;s also a time and place to step in.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor748"></a>
 Intentionally create <a id="_idIndexMarker559"></a>
 transparency <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The world of management can be very secretive. You work privately with your reports on their areas for growth. You attend confidential executive meetings. You learn about new initiatives and priorities. Much of your time is spent on work you can&apos;t talk about openly.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This secrecy has a few downsides. Your reports might assume you don&apos;t do much, and that can erode their respect for you. Additionally, when the secrecy involves useful context for decision-making, the team might make uninformed decisions or be confused by the requests they&apos;re getting. It&apos;s useful to counteract this secrecy by intentionally creating transparency:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Send out a list of your monthly priorities.</span>
 This can be high-level bullet points that are appropriately anonymized to maintain privacy. Often, just showing how many different things you&apos;re working on can earn credibility. The list helps people reach out to you at the start of an initiative, when there&apos;s still time for them to have an influence. It&apos;s also helpful to show what things you&apos;re not working on.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Talk to your reports about what&apos;s on your mind.</span>
 What keeps you up at night? What are you excited about? As much as possible, let them learn from you.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Include your reports on your work, whenever possible.</span>
 If you&apos;re working on strategy, ask your reports for their input and feedback. If you&apos;re going to give a high-stakes presentation, do a dry run in front of your team. They&apos;ll get a peek into your world and learn a lot from the example you set.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Share context from your higher-level meetings to your team.</span>
 One easy way to do this is to schedule your team meeting soon after your manager&apos;s team meeting so the information is fresh in your mind. Of course, respect confidentiality, but a lot of content from those meetings are relevant and not confidential.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Transparency can&apos;t always be offered, but when it can, it builds trust, respect, and a sense of fairness.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor749" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Concepts and Frameworks</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor750"></a>
 <a id="_idTextAnchor751"></a>
 The <a id="_idIndexMarker560"></a>
 <a id="_idIndexMarker561"></a>
 &quot;Do, Try, Consider&quot; framework for product feedback</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Asana&apos;s &quot;Do, Try, Consider&quot; framework is a great way to empower your team while ensuring consistent and high-quality results. It gives approvers a clear way to share <a id="_idIndexMarker562"></a>
 mandatory and non-mandatory feedback without being misunderstood.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-002-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00041.html#endnote-002">2</a>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="Text-Center"><img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-1" src="Image00061.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">With this framework, when you give feedback, you clearly state if it is a &quot;do,&quot; &quot;try,&quot; or &quot;consider.&quot; Each type of feedback has clear expectations around the intention of the feedback and how the team should respond.</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Do</span>
 : Mandatory feedback. Teams try to find a solution and implement it by the next milestone. They&apos;ll loop back with stakeholders to let them know it&apos;s done or if any surprises came up. Use sparingly.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Try</span>
 : Request a specific exploratory next step like drawing some options or looking into the code to cost something. After doing the exploration and sharing it with the stakeholders, the team is empowered to decide whether they need to change course or not.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Consider</span>
 : Share ideas or alternate ways of thinking about a problem. After thinking through the point briefly and responding, the team is empowered to take the feedback or not.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">To use this framework with your team, first introduce the concepts, and then be sure to tell them when you&apos;re using it. It might take a few examples before people really understand the type of response you&apos;re expecting. Soon the vocabulary will become second nature.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor752"></a>
 <a id="_idIndexMarker563"></a>
 Editing Framework</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Shreyas Doshi, a product leader who has previously worked at Stripe, Google, Twitter, and other companies, explains that one of the most important changes that a person must make when becoming a manager is shifting from creating work to editing work.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The first part of being a good editor is <span class="CharOverride-1">recognizing</span>
 that your job has shifted from creator to editor. As a product leader, you need to create a strong team of PMs who can self-manage, and to do that you need to give them room to exercise their judgment. That will be the only way you can scale your impact.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Switching to an editor mindset can be especially hard for managers who feel like they need to prove they deserve the job. They might feel like criticizing the decisions of people on their team validates their own skills. Instead, you want to approach the situation with curiosity, such as, &quot;Tell me what problem you&apos;re trying to solve with this.&quot;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The next part is to apply editing to all granularities, from product strategy down to pixels. To do this, you&apos;ll need to set expectations with your team that you intend to edit their work. You intend to offer suitable opinions on the work and evaluate the success of the work. Many PMs don&apos;t know what their manager&apos;s job really is; you&apos;ll need to explain what success looks like for you so they&apos;ll understand why you are editing their work. Be clear on which things you want to edit thoroughly versus which are optional to edit thoroughly. Beyond creating clarity, this signals which projects are the most important and where the PM should be spending the most time.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Finally, when it comes time for the actual editing, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Listen and ask questions</span>
 : Improve your understanding before opining on things.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Reframe problems</span>
 : Is the PM thinking too small? Are they worried about an impediment that you know can be resolved? Are they focused on the wrong problem?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Explore alternatives</span>
 : Ask which alternatives they&apos;ve considered and discuss them. If they&apos;ve missed something in their evaluation of the options, let them know. If they haven&apos;t considered alternatives, ask them to.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Direct or delegate decisions</span>
 : Be clear on which of your <a id="_idIndexMarker564"></a>
 feedback is input for them to consider, which are strong suggestions, and which are non-negotiable.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">By following these steps, you give your team the space and direction they need to deliver great work.</p>

 Key Takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Your team is the leadership team</span>
 : As a manager, your primary responsibility is to the broader company, not the people who report to you. Most of the time what&apos;s best for your team <span class="CharOverride-1">is</span>
 best for the company, but you can&apos;t let fear of upsetting a report prevent you from doing the right thing.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Lead through strategy</span>
 : The primary way you direct your team should be through the strategy you set. If you focus on setting up the right vision, goals, and principles, you can then empower teams to execute. This keeps you out of micromanagement.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Shift from creator to editor</span>
 : Recognize that it is no longer your job to make decisions, but rather to set up the context and review the work. The PMs on your team are now the owners of their work. Be clear when your feedback is mandatory or not. Give them the space to exercise their judgment.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Obsolete yourself</span>
 : The best way to advance as a manager is to coach and train your reports to take on more and more of your current responsibilities. As they grow into your current role, that frees you up to work on higher level responsibilities.</li>
