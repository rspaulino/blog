<p class="First-Paragraph---Main-Book">
<span class="AllCaps-Bold _idGenCharOverride-1">PMs have a</span>
 touchy relationship with technical skills. Some PMs come from an engineering background and need to learn how not to step on their engineer&apos;s toes. Others have never written a line of code and are afraid they&apos;ll sound stupid if they ask questions.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Overall, PMs need to understand the technology behind their product enough to be an effective partner to their engineers in brainstorming, costing, problem solving, and representing the team. Beyond that, engineers often appreciate when PMs are willing and able to take on some easy or tedious coding tasks; it can help teams to hit their deadlines, ship with more polish, and build camaraderie.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor207" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Responsibilities</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor208"></a>
 Partner with engineers on product decisions</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Some PMs believe it&apos;s their job to have all the ideas and do all the product thinking. They&apos;ll go off with their designers and come up with a grand vision to present to the developers for implementation. If an engineer comes up with a proposal, they&apos;ll quickly dismiss it—either out of a lack of respect or because they&apos;re being territorial.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Instead, proactively share your product thinking with engineers. Include them in brainstorming meetings and ask them for their input. Engineers often become the source of innovative ideas because they know the technological possibilities.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Laika Kayani, Sr. Director at AI Platform Product Management at Lumiata, explained how she works with engineers to create great solutions:</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">As a PM, I&apos;m very specific about the outcome I&apos;m looking to achieve for the customer. When we build a new machine learning model, we talk about whether we&apos;re optimizing for speed, cost, or performance and discuss options. One time, I worked with a customer who was hitting capacity issues with their ML models. One option would have been to simplify the ML features of the model all together. When I discussed the customer&apos;s goals with the engineers, we came up with a better solution where our company hosted the infrastructure rather than the customer relying on an internal IT team to allocate additional capacity.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Working together often leads to better solutions than either of you could come up with on your own.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor209"></a>
 Learn about how the technical infrastructure impacts the product</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You might not have a technical background, but you&apos;re probably a generally intelligent person. That, and a little bit of bravery, is really all you need to be successful with technical skills in your early career.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Find an engineer you feel comfortable with and ask them how the system works. They&apos;ll use words you probably don&apos;t understand, so ask them what those words mean. Ask them what the implications of the system are on the product, what kinds of things are easy to build, and what things are difficult.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As a PM, you&apos;ll have assumptions about what types of things can be built and approximately how long they would take. When you&apos;re caught by surprise, or you&apos;re told, &quot;We can&apos;t do that—it&apos;s too difficult,&quot; ask for clarification so you can understand the details.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">For more approaches on how to tackle something that&apos;s &quot;too hard to build&quot;, see <a href="text00013.html#_idTextAnchor236">&quot;What does &quot;that&apos;s too hard to build&quot; actually mean?&quot; in Chapter 8</a>
 . There are often alternative solutions that will accomplish your goals.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor210"></a>
 If you know how to code, consider contributing to help out</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This advice is a bit of a double-edged sword. As you advance in your career, you don&apos;t want to pick up coding responsibilities that take away from your time to invest in strategic thinking. Early in your career, however, writing some code can be a quick way to earn credibility with your engineers and help your team.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The best types of tasks to pick up are those that your engineers don&apos;t really want to do. For example, many engineers shy away from frontend work like writing simple CSS. Often, the work they don&apos;t want to do is tedious, which is great because they can teach you how to do it once and then you can learn by doing it over and over again.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Stay away from any code that your engineers aren&apos;t excited to have your help on, and don&apos;t let your coding erode your <a id="_idIndexMarker172"></a>
 humility. If your attempts to help out aren&apos;t appreciated, there are probably much better things for you to spend your time on.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor211" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Growth Practices</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor212"></a>
 Check in with your manager and engineers</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The amount and type of technical skills that are needed and valued can vary from role to role and company to company.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It&apos;s a good idea to check with your manager and engineering partners as to what they feel might be useful. They can let you know if they think a coding class would be helpful, and if so, what language. Instead of coding, they might prefer you to just familiarize yourself with the specific technologies the team uses or to skip technical skills and focus your time elsewhere.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor213"></a>
 Build your costing intuition <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Early in your career, you want to tread lightly and avoid estimating engineering costs. Engineers are very sensitive to PMs suggesting that work could be done more quickly, so it&apos;s better to ask directly instead of assuming.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Once you&apos;ve built up credibility and formed strong relationships with engineers, you can get a lot of product benefits by understanding engineering costs and being able to do rough costing on your own.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Before we go further, I want to reiterate:</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">You can make a time estimate for your own benefit, but never sign your team up for anything. If you will be using a time estimate outside of just personal use, it&apos;s crucial that this estimate came from the engineers.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">So, what can you do with your own estimates? A few options:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Sift through the solution space to figure out which solutions are likely, or unlikely, to be too costly.</span>
 This is great when you&apos;re working with a designer or a stakeholder because you can quickly flag ideas that might be expensive and come up with alternatives in the moment. That quick feedback can save a lot of iteration cycles. If you&apos;re going with this approach, it&apos;s a good practice to double check the cost of the original idea with an engineer later, to make sure you didn&apos;t dismiss an idea too quickly.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Catch misunderstandings or missing information early.</span>
 If you expected a change to take a few hours, but the engineer thinks it will take two weeks, one of you knows something the other doesn&apos;t. Perhaps you know about an existing component or a pre-calculated value that can be reused. Once you&apos;ve been at the company for a while, or if you&apos;re bringing relevant information from your last company, it&apos;s not that uncommon for a PM to know something that can really speed up the technical implementation.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Take a first pass at</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-1"><a id="_idIndexMarker173"></a>
</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-1">prioritization (on a smaller scale) and</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-1"><a id="_idIndexMarker174"></a>
</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-1">roadmapping (at a larger scale).</span>
 Prioritization and roadmapping are all about cost vs. benefit, so the better your intuition on the cost, the more reasonable your first draft will be. As you&apos;re sharing your draft with engineering, you can include your rough costing estimate at the small/medium/large level of granularity (often called t-shirt sizing). Make sure to ask if any of your estimates are off.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor214"></a>
 How to Build Your Costing Intuition</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">To build your costing intuition, you need to understand how the work breaks down into component pieces, and then pattern match against how long similar pieces took to build. It&apos;s important to pattern match against work within the same company because things like the <a id="_idIndexMarker175"></a>
 infrastructure, <a id="_idIndexMarker176"></a>
 testing framework, and deployment schedule can have a big impact on how long things take.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The two biggest factors in cost are usually:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">How much of the solution can be reused, and how much needs to be built from scratch.</span>
 For example, imagine you&apos;re adding a form to a dialog box and you want it to have a calendar picker and a color picker. If your product already has those pickers, it will probably be pretty cheap to build. If not, it will take longer and be more costly.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Performance.</span>
 If you want something that touches a lot of pieces of data–like counting up millions of records–that will usually be intolerably slow if built in a low-cost and straightforward way. It might even create stability issues. The same thing applies for a design that needs to look up a lot of data sequentially, such as finding all the actors in a movie, and then all the other movies those actors have been in. There are engineering techniques to make designs like that work fast, but it takes longer and is more costly to build them.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor215" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Concepts and Frameworks</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor216"></a>
 Technical terms and concepts</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It&apos;s impossible to teach you everything there is to know about technology, but here is a quick crash course. Understanding this terminology will greatly help you when talking with your engineers.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor217"></a>
 API</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-1">API</span>
 stands for Application Programming Interface. It&apos;s the equivalent of UI for computers communicating with each other.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There are internal APIs that different products and systems within your company use to talk with each other, and external APIs that can be used by developers outside of your company to connect to your product or build on top of it. Just like a person is limited by the UI (for example, the mobile version of an app might not have the same functionality as the web version), computers are limited by what APIs are available.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Companies with a wide variety of products often move to a <a id="_idIndexMarker177"></a>
 <span class="CharOverride-1">service-oriented architecture</span>
 , which is when the components and pieces of <a id="_idIndexMarker178"></a>
 infrastructure are separated into isolated <span class="CharOverride-1">services</span>
 that communicate over APIs, rather than being an interconnected tangle of code.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor218"></a>
 Implementing APIs</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When talking about APIs, you might hear <a id="_idIndexMarker179"></a>
 <span class="CharOverride-1">CRUD</span>
 (pronounced like the word &quot;crud&quot;), which stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete, which are the four basic actions you can take on data. For example, a CRUD API on Twitter for tweets would let you create a new tweet, retrieve the text of a tweet (if you know its numeric ID), edit the tweet, or delete the tweet.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-001-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00013.html#endnote-001">1</a>
</span>
</span>
 A CRUD API is usually the first API a product would provide, before building more special-purpose APIs, such as to pin a tweet to your profile.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Many APIs will either use <span class="CharOverride-1">XML</span>
 or <span class="CharOverride-1">JSON</span>
 (<span class="CharOverride-1">JavaScript Object Notation</span>
 ) to format the information they share. Both are text-based formats that are easy for computers to parse and understand. If you hear people talk about <span class="CharOverride-1">JSON</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-1">objects</span>
 or a <span class="CharOverride-1">JSON Blob</span>
 , they&apos;re talking about a piece of data formatted in that easily shareable and usable structure.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">For <span class="CharOverride-1">authentication</span>
 (<span class="CharOverride-1">auth</span>
 ), APIs usually use <span class="CharOverride-1">access tokens</span>
 instead of sending your username and password around on every request. Think of access tokens like getting a hand stamp after showing your ticket at a museum.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor219"></a>
 Client (also called frontend) and server (also called backend)</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The <span class="CharOverride-1">client</span>
 is the part of the product that runs on the user&apos;s device—for example, the mobile app or the website you see when a page loads. The <span class="CharOverride-1">server</span>
 is the part of the product that runs on the company&apos;s computers or on cloud computing services like <a id="_idIndexMarker180"></a>
 Amazon Web Services (AWS). Any data you can access from multiple devices is stored on the server, and the client only gets a temporary copy.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Things that can be done purely on the client side can be instant, while things that require a <span class="CharOverride-1">round trip to the server</span>
 (the client sends a message to the server of what it wants, and the server sends back a response) often have a noticeable delay of a quarter of a second or more.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor220"></a>
 Mobile vs. web apps</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">On a mobile app, there&apos;s often a lot of content in the mobile client, which is why they take a while to download and you need to perform periodic app updates. Images and especially videos will make it take especially long; text doesn&apos;t make as much of a difference. After you open the app, you&apos;ll sometimes get a slow progress bar that says, &quot;downloading new content.&quot; If you&apos;re using the app in airplane mode, that means you&apos;re using it without the server. If you fix a bug in your mobile app, you need to resubmit it to the app store and wait for people to download the update.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">On a web app, the client code is downloaded from the server every time you reload the page. This is why you never need to update your web app. In a web app, if you notice a problem, you can often fix it for customers within minutes.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor221"></a>
 Optimizations</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Need stuff to go faster? Here are some common approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">There are often <span class="CharOverride-1">background jobs</span>
 or <span class="CharOverride-1">cron jobs</span>
 that run on the server. A job is an independent piece of code that runs separately from the rest of the server code, rather than in direct reaction to a client request. A cron job is a job that runs on a regular schedule (such as every ten minutes or every night) and might be used, for example, to send out a daily summary email. A background job runs in the background to <a id="_idIndexMarker181"></a>
 <span class="CharOverride-1">asynchronously</span>
 perform tasks that are too slow for the client to just wait. Background jobs might perform tasks for users, such as generating a big export file, or they might perform tasks for the system, such as when a profile name change takes a few minutes to propagate through the system.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Somewhere in this system there might be a <a id="_idIndexMarker182"></a>
 <span class="CharOverride-1">cache</span>
 (pronounced &quot;cash&quot;), or multiple caches. One popular caching system is called <span class="CharOverride-1">memcache</span>
 . A cache speeds things up by storing the results of expensive calculations. That&apos;s great, but they sometimes introduce bugs, and they can quickly drive certain server costs up.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Lazy loading</span>
 is a coding design pattern where you defer an expensive calculation until it&apos;s needed. For example, imagine you&apos;ve had a product for a few years and now you want to remove curse words from all user-generated content. Instead of running a background job to update all the content (which could take months), you could remove the curse words only when someone tries to look at the content.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Also read about <a href="text00013.html#_idTextAnchor230">&quot;Optimizing databases&quot; in Chapter 8</a>
 .</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor222"></a>
 Deployments and development, <a id="_idIndexMarker183"></a>
 <a id="_idIndexMarker184"></a>
 testing, staging, beta, and production servers</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Engineers write code all day, but that code doesn&apos;t immediately go live for customers as soon as it&apos;s written. Instead, they test out the code in a sequence of isolated development environments to make sure that it performs as intended, functions well with all the recent changes that other engineers have made, and works with real data. <span class="CharOverride-1">Deployment</span>
 is the process of getting the new code live for customers.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Engineers start with a <span class="CharOverride-1">local</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-1">sandbox</span>
 (also called the <span class="CharOverride-1">development server</span>
 or <span class="CharOverride-1">dev</span>
 ) that runs on their own machine.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-002-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00013.html#endnote-002">2</a>
</span>
</span>
 The sandbox environment might have a lot of differences from the real environment (for example, having just a tiny amount of fake data), but it&apos;s very quick to see how the code works and iterate on it. Each engineer has their own sandbox so everyone can write code at the same time. After an engineer types the code, they might have to <span class="CharOverride-1">build</span>
 or <span class="CharOverride-1">compile</span>
 the code, and that could take a while, depending on the computer language and the architecture of the codebase. Speeding up compile times can make a big difference in the speed of development, as it allows developers to more quickly test their code.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Part of writing code involves writing new <span class="CharOverride-1">tests</span>
 that validate that the code works as expected. If the team uses <span class="CharOverride-1">test-driven development</span>
 (TDD), they write each test <span class="CharOverride-2">before</span>
 writing the associated code—the tests serve as a type of spec or acceptance criteria. For most other teams, the main purpose of the newly written tests is not to catch bugs, but rather to prevent future code from accidentally breaking this code.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor223"></a>
 Managing code</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As the engineers write their code, they use a <span class="CharOverride-1">version control system</span>
 such as <span class="CharOverride-1">git</span>
 or <span class="CharOverride-1">github</span>
 to keep track of their changes and get the new code that the rest of the engineers have written. The centralized copy of all the code is called the <span class="CharOverride-1">master branch</span>
 .</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Each engineer has a <span class="CharOverride-1">local repository</span>
 , or a copy of all the code on their local machine. When they start working on a new feature, they&apos;ll often create a new, named <span class="CharOverride-1">feature branch</span>
 . Each branch has its own changes and version history. Branches are helpful because if an engineer is halfway through a new feature and someone asks them to fix a bug in a different part, they can switch to a new branch to make the small fix while still saving all of their other work separately.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor224"></a>
 Committing code</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As the engineer works, they <a id="_idIndexMarker185"></a>
 <span class="CharOverride-1">commit</span>
 the changes, which is basically saving the changes back to the version control system and updating the version history. Once everything is ready and they want to <span class="CharOverride-1">merge</span>
 their branch back into the master branch, they create a <span class="CharOverride-1">Pull Request</span>
 (<span class="CharOverride-1">PR</span>
 ) or <a id="_idIndexMarker186"></a>
 <span class="CharOverride-1">change list</span>
 . The PR shows all the <span class="CharOverride-1">diffs</span>
 , or changes (lines of code added, removed, or changed). If you know how to read code, it can sometimes be helpful to take a look at the PR—for example, to learn what an event is named in the logs.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The PR might now be sent off for a <a id="_idIndexMarker187"></a>
 <span class="CharOverride-1">code review</span>
 , which is when another engineer looks over the code to catch bugs or style mistakes. Many companies require code reviews prior to checking in code. If your team doesn&apos;t follow this practice yet, you might want to look into it. It&apos;s a good way to catch bugs, ensure good practices, train new people, and also help each person on the team understand the codebase more fully.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Once the PR is accepted, everyone else&apos;s changes from the master branch are <span class="CharOverride-1">merged</span>
 into the local branch. If everyone was editing different lines of code, the merged code will automatically combine everyone&apos;s changes. If two people tried to edit the same line, it will send back a <span class="CharOverride-1">merge conflict</span>
 and the engineer needs to look at it to manually fix it.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor225"></a>
 Validating code before deployment</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The PR is then <span class="CharOverride-1">pushed</span>
 to the <a id="_idIndexMarker188"></a>
 <span class="CharOverride-1">testing server</span>
 to run tests. The <a id="_idIndexMarker189"></a>
 testing server is shared with all of the engineers, so if a lot of them submit code at the same time, there might be a long wait while tests run.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The testing server usually runs <span class="CharOverride-1">unit tests</span>
 and <span class="CharOverride-1">integration tests</span>
 . Unit tests are small isolated tests that automatically run through all the functionality of a component and check that the right results are returned. The point of unit tests isn&apos;t really to check that the code you just wrote is correct; it&apos;s more to ensure that no one else makes a change that breaks your code. Integration tests are larger tests that run through flows and can ensure full use cases work.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If the company uses <span class="CharOverride-1">continuous deployment</span>
 , code that passes tests automatically is merged back into the shared master branch and deployed to the next server in the sequence. It might either go directly to the <span class="CharOverride-1">production server</span>
 (<span class="CharOverride-1">prod</span>
 ) that is used by real customers, to a <span class="CharOverride-1">beta server</span>
 that internal employees or a small percentage of customers use, or to a <span class="CharOverride-1">staging server</span>
 that is an exact copy of production to run <span class="CharOverride-1">load tests</span>
 . Each company will have a set of rules for when the code is ready to go to the next server—for example, after a few hours, or when the production engineer says it&apos;s ready.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor226"></a>
 When the coding stops</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If code is submitted that stops the shared master branch from compiling, this is referred to as <span class="CharOverride-1">breaking the build</span>
 . This usually happens when an engineer skips the testing steps in an attempt to save time. No one can submit new code until the build is fixed.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Once the code goes live, that doesn&apos;t always mean that customers will start seeing the new functionality. Changes or new features can be gated behind a <span class="CharOverride-1">feature flag</span>
 , which is a configuration setting that lets you toggle functionality on or off. Flags are often used as a part of <a id="_idIndexMarker190"></a>
 A/B testing—each user randomly has the flag on or off. The code for using flags simply says, &quot;If the flag is on, run this code; otherwise run that code.&quot;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Sometimes, companies will have a <a id="_idIndexMarker191"></a>
 <span class="CharOverride-1">code freeze</span>
 . This is when code stops automatically deploying to the next server. This is done to prevent new bugs during important times, such as when most people will be out of the office for a holiday, or when there&apos;s a big launch happening. During a code freeze, commits can be manually deployed individually (also called <span class="CharOverride-1">cherry-picked)</span>
 , such as to fix a single bug.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor227"></a>
 Product <a id="_idIndexMarker192"></a>
 analytics and logging</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Modern applications have rich <span class="CharOverride-1">product analytics</span>
 and <span class="CharOverride-1">log</span>
 almost everything that users do.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The things that are logged (such as when a person opens the app, hovers over the search button, clicks the search button, or clicks on a search result) are called <span class="CharOverride-1">events</span>
 . The events aren&apos;t automatically logged; engineers must add a little bit of code for any action they want to log, which is also called adding <span class="CharOverride-1">instrumentation</span>
 .</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When an event is logged, a lot of information can be recorded, such as the name of the event, the time the event happened, the user ID of the person who did the event, the type of device they were on, and any other <span class="CharOverride-1">metadata</span>
 you would want to <a id="_idIndexMarker193"></a>
 slice and dice. For example, when someone presses the search button, you could also log how many words they had typed into the box.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">After the events are logged, they often need to be processed before you can look at them. This usually happens overnight (via a cron job), so when you come in to work in the morning, you can look at data up to yesterday. There are privacy implications of looking at raw logs, so usually the data needs to be anonymized and aggregated before anyone looks at it.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor228"></a>

 SQL and databases</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Databases</span>
 are the systems that store data, like a supercharged spreadsheet for computers to use.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">

</span>
 Just like there can be multiple sheets in a spreadsheet, there can be multiple <span class="CharOverride-1">tables</span>
 in a database. Different database types are optimized to do different things quickly.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Your product will probably use a general-purpose database like <span class="CharOverride-1">MySQL</span>
 , <span class="CharOverride-1">Postgres</span>
 , or <span class="CharOverride-1">MongoDB</span>
 for all of the important data your product has, such as user information and user-generated content.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">For event logs and business analytics, your company might also use a special-purpose <span class="CharOverride-1">data warehouse</span>
 like <span class="CharOverride-1">Redshift</span>
 . The logs are moved into the data warehouse with a process called <a id="_idIndexMarker195"></a>
 <span class="CharOverride-1">ETL</span>
 (Extract, Transform, Load).</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If your product provides search, you might also use <span class="CharOverride-1">ElasticSearch.</span>
</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor229"></a>
 SQL</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-1">SQL</span>
 (pronounced &quot;sequel&quot;) stands for Structured Query Language. It is the computer language used to add, edit, and retrieve data from most databases. As a person, you can use SQL to interact directly with the database, but usually, you would only do that with logs databases, not production databases. For production databases, the server code generates the SQL query and sends it to the database.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In general, doing something in SQL is much faster than doing it in server code, but there are limits to what types of things SQL can do.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor230"></a>
 <a id="_idTextAnchor231"></a>
 Optimizing databases</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The information in a database is generally split across multiple tables to avoid duplication and needs to be recombined before it can be displayed by the product. For example, in a database storing posts and comments, one table might hold comments with its parent (post) ID, while another table stores the actual posts. When the program wants to show how many comments post 1234 has, it may need to perform the relatively slow operation of counting all the comments tied to post 1234.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">To speed up the app, they could store a <span class="CharOverride-1">denormalized</span>
 copy of the precalculated comment count in the posts table and try to keep it in sync with the correct count. Denormalization improves <span class="CharOverride-1">read speeds</span>
 (the time it takes to view data) at the expense of slower <span class="CharOverride-1">write speeds</span>
 (the time it takes to add or update data). It&apos;s widely used, but can lead to bugs and longer development time.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor232"></a>
 <a id="_idTextAnchor233"></a>
 <a id="_idIndexMarker196"></a>
 Algorithms and Data Structures</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A <span class="CharOverride-1">hash table</span>
 or <span class="CharOverride-1">hash map</span>
 is a widely used coding technique (a data structure) that makes it very fast to map a <span class="CharOverride-1">key (</span>
 any unique number, word, or phrase) to a <span class="CharOverride-1">value</span>
 . Engineers figure out all kinds of clever ways to use hash tables to solve problems. For example, you ask your engineer if your idea for a feature would be too slow and they might reply, &quot;No problem. I can use a hash table.&quot; Don&apos;t, however, suggest a hash table to your engineer; if you don&apos;t know what you&apos;re talking about you&apos;ll sound foolish.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Running time</span>
 or <span class="CharOverride-1">big O notation</span>
 is a way of describing the efficiency of an algorithm (in relation to the amount of data). It doesn&apos;t give an exact time; rather, it is essentially a mathematical function to describe how much slower the algorithm gets when the data gets large. For example, if you double the number of contacts in your address book, does your filtering algorithm stay the same speed? Or does it take twice as long—or worse? The common runtimes you&apos;ll hear are:<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-004-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00013.html#endnote-004">4</a>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">O(1) (&quot;constant time&quot;):</span>
 The algorithm stays roughly the same speed, no matter how much data you have.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">O(log n) (&quot;log n time&quot;):</span>
 The algorithm gets a little slower as the dataset increases, but even doubling the data makes little difference. A 10x increase in the dataset might, for example, double the runtime.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">O(n) (&quot;linear time&quot;):</span>
 The algorithm increases proportionally to the dataset size. So if your dataset increases 10x, the runtime might increase 10x too.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">O(n log n) (&quot;n log n time&quot;):</span>
 The algorithm is a little worse than linear. A dataset increase of 10x might, for example, increase the runtime 11x. This is tolerable for real-life problems, and is actually how long sorting will typically take.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">O(n^2) (&quot;n squared&quot;):</span>
 The algorithm is much worse than linear. If the dataset increases by 10x, you might get a 100x increase in the runtime. That&apos;s usually unacceptable for software, unless you know that you&apos;ll only be running it on very small amounts of data.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">O(2^n) (&quot;exponential&quot;):</span>
 Eek. The algorithm is so, so, so much worse than linear; a 10x increase in data may cause a 1000x increase in runtime. A 20x increase would mean a 1,000,000 increase in runtime. See the problem? One would very rarely implement an algorithm like this in production software. It&apos;s just too slow.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Is O(n) faster than O(n^2)? Yes and no. On very small amounts of data, maybe not. But when your data gets sufficiently large, then yes. However, one O(n) algorithm could be much faster than another O(n) algorithm. Mathematicians probably won&apos;t like this, but you can think about big O as a somewhat handy-wavy description of how slow your algorithm gets when you have a ton of data. O(1) and O(log N) algorithms are usually great, and O(n) and O(n log n) is usually fine. O(n^2) or slower is usually unworkable. But it all depends on what you&apos;re doing!<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">

 A few more terms</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Since clients and servers can be anywhere in the world, time zones make dates and times ambiguous. To fix this, the code usually stores and does calculations in <span class="CharOverride-1">UTC time</span>
 (Coordinated Universal Time), and then adjusts for local time zones before displaying to users. UTC time almost matches up with Greenwich Mean Time (GMT, the time zone London, England is in) except it doesn&apos;t change for daylight savings time.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Swag</span>
 stands for Scientific Wild-Ass Guess and is another word for a cost estimate. The word swag is meant to convey that the estimate is just a guess. When using swags to build a timeline, you usually at least double them–perhaps even quadruple them–to account for the estimate being off and to account for all the other things that need to get done in a day, such as doing <a id="_idIndexMarker197"></a>
 code reviews and writing tests.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">UUID</span>
 or <span class="CharOverride-1">GUID</span>
 (pronounced as two syllables: &quot;goo ihd&quot;) stands for Universally Unique Identifier or Globally Unique Identifier. These are very large randomly-generated strings (for example, &quot;712f58d0-0208-4fc4-b80f-fc4e960bfac2&quot;) that are typically used to give an &quot;ID number&quot; to objects in a database. They are handy because you can assume they are unique, without actually having to check if you&apos;ve used that ID before. (Why don&apos;t you need to check? Because it&apos;s just phenomenally unlikely.)</li>

<span class="CharOverride-1">Technical</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-1"><a id="_idIndexMarker198"></a>
</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-1">debt</span>
 is the concept that doing things the fast way now will create bugs, cause future work to take more time, or require additional engineering work in the future. When you borrow money—take out financial debt—you get the ability to buy something now, but you have to pay it back (with interest!) in the future. Technical debt works the same way; you can launch now, but you&apos;ll have to pay for it later. And, just like financial debt, there is a time for technical debt. But one should proceed carefully here because it can catch up to you.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor236"></a>
 <a id="_idTextAnchor237"></a>
 What does &quot;that&apos;s too hard to build&quot; actually mean?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">At many points in your career, an engineer will tell you that your idea is too hard to build. Don&apos;t let that be the end of the conversation. Dig deeper to figure out exactly what they mean. Ask why it&apos;s deemed too challenging, and what parts make it so.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There are three common responses: high expense, poor performance/scalability, and increased technical debt.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor238"></a>
 It would be expensive to build</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">&quot;Hard&quot; often means that it would take a long time to build.</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Perhaps the engineers are using a pre-built component that doesn&apos;t support the functionality you want, and they&apos;d have to build their own component from scratch to support your idea.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">It might be that you&apos;re underestimating how many parts are needed to make your idea work.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">It could mean that they&apos;d have to touch a part of the code base they&apos;re not familiar with, which would require ramp up time.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Maybe it would require a data migration that would take weeks to run.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Once you understand which parts are expensive, you might be able to find alternatives that are much less expensive. The component might provide slightly different functionality that would still be acceptable. You might not need every part of your idea. Perhaps an engineer who&apos;s already familiar with the code base could help out. You might decide you don&apos;t need to migrate old data.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Another good follow-up question in these cases is, &quot;How long do you think it would take?&quot; If the work is important enough, you might decide it&apos;s worth it to take the extra time, or you could ask for more engineers on your team to help.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor239"></a>
 The performance would be very slow or have poor scalability</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">&quot;Hard&quot; sometimes means that the feature you&apos;re asking for requires calculations that take a long time or take up significant computer resources. For example, you have a list that contains millions of items, and you want to count up a subset of them. Or, maybe, you have a list that&apos;s thousands of items long and you want to compare each item to every other item.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There are several ways to handle performance concerns:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Add limits. For example, you could show &quot;99+&quot; if the count goes past 99.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Change the product to something that needs fewer calculations at a time. For example, you could do the comparison only after you&apos;ve narrowed it down to one item.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Invest more engineering time to build a system that can show the results quicker. For example, you could denormalize, <a id="_idIndexMarker199"></a>
 cache, or pre-calculate the information.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Performance is very important, so if you can&apos;t find an alternative solution, you might need to cut the slow feature.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor240"></a>
 It would introduce technical <a id="_idIndexMarker200"></a>
 debt that makes future projects take longer to build</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">&quot;Hard&quot; sometimes means that the solution would add undesirable complexity or be fragile and error-prone. For example, it could mean moving away from standard components, introducing new backend systems, or adding a corner case that needs to be remembered in the future.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Technical debt is challenging to work around. It makes your engineer&apos;s jobs more difficult and slows down future development. It&apos;s not good to argue against it, and it tends to be the least understandable. So, while it&apos;s still a good idea to ask which part adds debt, you may not understand the answer well enough to formulate alternatives.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As always, you can ask your engineers if they can devise alternatives that wouldn&apos;t have the same engineering debt. If they understand the problem space, they might come up with something spectacular.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you still think it&apos;s important to build it, try seeing if the team can launch now, and invest in fixing the engineering debt later. You should only go with this approach if you can actually commit to investing the time later.</p>

 Key Takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Partnering is critical:</span>
 The most important technical skill is building a strong partnership with engineering. If you feel comfortable asking questions and you include engineers early on in the product life cycle, you can almost always learn the technical details you need on the job.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">You don&apos;t need a technical background to learn your product&apos;s technology</span>
 : Develop your understanding of the technical infrastructure of your product to the extent that it impacts user-facing decisions. Don&apos;t let lack of confidence or embarrassment stop you from understanding the constraints. Ask questions.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Dig into &quot;that&apos;s too hard&quot;</span>
 : When an engineer tells you that something is too hard to build, it can mean several different things. Learn which one it is, and take appropriate action from there.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Estimating costs is a skill you build over time</span>
 : Build up your judgment over time of how long different features take to build and which details can make a project longer or shorter. Use that judgment to consider and propose alternate solutions, but check with engineers in case you&apos;re missing something.</li>

On 10 pieces of data, it takes 110 seconds. So it has not actually doubled in time, even though the input size has doubled! However, the slope is linear.
