 How did you get into product management?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I grew up in Texas, far away from the software development world and Silicon Valley, but I always had an interest in computers. I typed in all the metadata for my baseball card collection so that I knew what baseball cards I had without having to flip through the book.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When I got to college, it never occurred to me to choose computer science, so I fell into programming through my part-time job doing tech support. I taught myself to code so I could make the training modules easier to navigate rather than being on the phone myself.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">After college, I started my career as a software engineer at Travelocity, working on partnerships and integrations with sites like Yahoo and AOL. Through that, I got exposure to companies in Silicon Valley and started asking questions about the partnership deals and product choices—the kind of questions that PMs ask.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I wanted to become a PM but was told I needed an MBA, so I applied to business school. After I applied, I got the opportunity to become a PM at Travelocity without said MBA, which I took. When I got my acceptance letter to Haas (Berkeley) a few months later, I decided to go ahead and attend anyway. Then, when I graduated business school and joined Google, the market had changed and I was told I couldn&apos;t be a PM because I didn&apos;t have a CS degree.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">That&apos;s an important thing to know:</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">This role is always evolving and, particularly early in your career, you can run into a lot of reasons why you can&apos;t be a PM. It&apos;s about finding the right place where you can have a positive impact and develop your experience to the point where people stop questioning whether or not you&apos;re really a PM.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It takes a few practice runs for a lot of people. At some point, you&apos;ve got to get a break, and then it&apos;s much easier to find those opportunities afterwards.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">During those years at Google, I advocated for myself trying to make the transition from technology program manager, even moonlighting as a PM on a stealth project. Looking back on it, I was killing myself to try to prove that an exception should be made for me to get back to the role I&apos;d held three years prior before my MBA at Travelocity. Eventually, I left to be a PM at an earlier stage company that was less didactic about the qualifications to be a PM.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A few months later, I got a phone call from a friend at Twitter. I loved the product and couldn&apos;t say no. It was the opportunity to work on something at the intersection of a technology shift, which was mobile apps, and a cultural shift around people wanting to express themselves differently online. I joined Twitter as a PM on the tweet button and other platform products.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1155" style=";color:black;"></a>
 What were some key drivers of your career growth?</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">In terms of career growth, early in my career, I really had to ask for what I wanted. I asked for more opportunities. I asked to be in the room for certain things. I took on work no one asked me to do, as well. I initiated conversations about promotion opportunities or the next job.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">One of those opportunities was at Twitter, when we realized we needed somebody to run part of the newly-forming business development team. We had partnership deals with companies like Google and Microsoft that were really a product exercise. What problems are we trying to solve for our mutual users? How could we do that in a way that served the business goals of each organization?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">So, I switched over to do that. Afterwards, I came back to a traditional product management role to build the ads API and then ended up leading a significant portion of both the ads and the data PM teams.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1156" style=";color:black;"></a>
 How did you get into <a id="_idIndexMarker901" style=";color:black;"></a>
 angel investing?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">After I left Twitter, I launched #ANGELS with five of my ex-colleagues, and started angel investing. We saw some of our male peers were getting the opportunity to participate in the upside of interesting companies as angel investors and we thought we could build an umbrella and bring deals to us.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">That was really the point in my career where I started thinking about it as a portfolio rather than &quot;this is my job, and I give my job 200% of myself.&quot; I instead started to think about the different pots I want to have a hand in and how to run them simultaneously.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1157" style=";color:black;"></a>
 How did you join Slack and grow into the CPO role?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I met Stewart Butterfield, the CEO and one of the founders of Slack, while I was angel investing. I ended up joining Slack as the head of platform when it had about 150 employees. This was a GM role and it was a really valuable way for Stewart and I to get to know each other and assess whether or not we could have a working relationship that would be productive.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I built up the platform using all the skills that I&apos;d gained in my previous roles, like engineering and business development. I took what was a great team and an API and really developed a platform strategy around it. Just launching features into the world is never enough for a platform. You need to have a business development team that goes and works with the largest companies to bring them on board. You need a developer relations team that helps bring the broader ecosystem along and helps people understand what&apos;s possible with the technology. You need a platform marketing team and somebody that can help translate all of this to your end customers.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">We launched the Slack app directory about six months after I joined, and later that week Stewart asked me to be VP of product. In product-founder led companies, the fit between the founder and the first head of product doesn&apos;t work a lot of the time. The head of platform role was a great way to see what working together would be like. I ran the product organization over the next three years as VP and then eventually as chief product officer.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1158" style=";color:black;"></a>
 How might a PM know if product <a id="_idIndexMarker902" style=";color:black;"></a>
 leadership roles would be a good match for them?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The person that would love the VP of product or CPO role loves the internal <a id="_idIndexMarker903"></a>
 communication and leadership aspects of helping the entire company understand what&apos;s important and why. They can help people understand the choices that are being made. They can not only communicate a path forward that guides people to make the right decisions at every level in the organization, but can also institute the governance structure that allows for decisions to be made quickly and clearly.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">Ironically, for those senior leadership roles where you&apos;re managing a portfolio, you have to step back a little from the skills that got you there, like being incredibly passionate about the problem you&apos;re solving and being willing to do whatever it takes to make it successful.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Execs need to maintain some emotional distance from the &quot;what.&quot; Instead, they should ensure that people are staying aligned on the &quot;why&quot; and that they understand how to get work done within the organization.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Another difference between somebody that might be a great product manager and a great product leader might be that they are increasingly comfortable working cross functionally and good at reaching across the aisle to the business or the sales counterparts. A product leader needs to be comfortable playing that role—defining go-to-market strategy and even getting up on stage to unveil product launches. You may not use those skills for a long time in an IC PM career, and then all of a sudden, they&apos;re absolutely critical. And so that leap can be a little hard and a little rocky at times.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">That&apos;s the CPO path. Being an executive in general is about clarity of <a id="_idIndexMarker904"></a>
 communication, some amount of charismatic <a id="_idIndexMarker905"></a>
 leadership skills that make people want to join your organization and want to follow you, and <a id="_idIndexMarker906"></a>
 humility to face problems within the organization and tackle them head on.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1159" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Who is a good fit for angel investing?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You&apos;d enjoy it if you love meeting teams who are working on early ideas—if you are energized by that. I go through periods where I am, and periods where I&apos;m not. A lot of times they are <span class="CharOverride-1">just</span>
 ideas; they&apos;re not even products yet. It&apos;s very, very different than as a CPO, where you&apos;re really in it every single day and the customers and the business and the products are very tactile.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1160" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Who is a good fit for GM?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The GM role is one of the best jobs out there, in my opinion. It allows you to start having real ownership of connecting the dots between the different functions.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">I always say that shipping code to production is not a launch. A launch is when customers actually understand what it is and why they need it. There are lots of different ways to go about that, beyond just marketing.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The GM role is more of the business mold of a product leader than it is the technical- or product -vision piece that sometimes gets glorified. But, the companies that really stand out in terms of their results are the ones that can build a great product, but also are really savvy and work really hard at landing the go-to-market.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1161" style=";color:black;"></a>
 What advice would you give to PMs who want to advance in their careers?</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">The basics are to take responsibility for building a compelling vision that people want to attach themselves to, for things beyond what you&apos;re explicitly asked to do. To me, that&apos;s leadership—full stop.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you only do the things you&apos;re asked to do, then you&apos;re already in the right place on the org chart.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Companies that are growing fast are the best places to be able to advance in your career because there are new jobs opening up all the time and everybody&apos;s job is always getting bigger. There&apos;s movement, and where there&apos;s movement, there&apos;s opportunity.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1162" style=";color:black;"></a>
 What does growth look like for a PM?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There are three axes of growth I think about.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The first is that you <span class="CharOverride-2">identify adjacencies</span>
 to the part of the product you&apos;re responsible for. You identify new greenfield opportunities for products that amplify or extend what you&apos;re already doing. Over time you&apos;re sort of giving yourself a promotion because you&apos;re convincing the organization that they should invest in something bigger.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The second, which is more of a GM path, is to identify that there are <span class="CharOverride-2">other things the organization needs to do, beyond building the product</span>
 , that are going to improve the ROI for that investment. I advise people to get good at writing job <a id="_idIndexMarker907"></a>
 specs for jobs they&apos;ll never take. When you need a marketing partner, write a marketing spec being very clear about what you need. Then use that spec to start a conversation or even start the search yourself with a list of candidates to talk to. Sometimes you&apos;ll end up being the person to hire them, and now that&apos;s a new experience that you have.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The third is that you can <span class="CharOverride-2">create connections cross-functionally</span>
 . Particularly in an enterprise business, you need to spend time selling customers, closing customers, and dealing with them when they&apos;re upset. Almost as important is spending time with the sales team. You need to really have empathy for what it&apos;s like for them to go out and sell the product and market it, even when it might have some real gaps.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">The PMs who are willing to face those realities and work with the sales people build trust. Then you can actually be an enabler for the solution rather than a gatekeeper for the engineering resources, which is a trap that can put a PM in a challenging position in their organization.</p>
