 How did you get into product management?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I started my career as an engineer and startup founder. I was a member of the Snap founding team. After NBC invested, Snap became NBC Internet and I was promoted to CTO of NBC Internet. While I was there, I built sites like News.com and Download.com. My title was CTO, but that included a lot of work we&apos;d call product management. I was responsible for strategic product planning, corporate technical direction, and management.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">From there, I wanted to get back to a startup so I cofounded Grand Central Communications, which was an early cloud integration platform startup. I then went to Inktomi to lead search product strategy. When Yahoo acquired Inktomi, I became senior director of product management for the search products.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">After three years, I wanted to go to a small company again and joined Jotspot as VP of product. Jotspot was acquired by Google and our product offering was folded into G Suite as Google Sites and Google Docs.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">During my years as a product manager at Google, I was the product lead for Google Mobile Maps, Google Calendar, and Google Docs. I was an early member of the Google Apps team that ultimately became G Suite. It was really rewarding because I helped grow the enterprise business from its early beta state to millions of corporate users.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1109" style=";color:black;"></a>
 What led you to Google Ventures?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I had been at Google for a long time and was wondering if I wanted to get back into the startup world, but I still really loved the culture and people at Google. Moving to Google Ventures (GV) was great because I could move closer to startups and at the same time be a part of the Google platform and take advantage of everything that Google has.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I don&apos;t think I would have gone into venture if it hadn&apos;t been for GV. The traditional kind of venture capital environment wasn&apos;t as appealing to me. It was really just this unique kind of combination of opportunity, luck, and timing.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1110" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Do PMs generally do well in <a id="_idIndexMarker889" style=";color:black;"></a>
 VC firms?</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">Product people make great investors because we naturally have a generalist approach to the world. Investing requires the ability to see something from a lot of different perspectives—being able to know enough about business growth, product market fit, the technology, and the direction the industry is going to go.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Most PMs who make the leap into VC become investors, but there are other interesting roles as well. Some venture firms, including GV, have operating partners that aren&apos;t investors who work side-by-side with investors to help the portfolio companies. For earlier stage companies, they might help them find product-market fit. For later stage companies, they might help operationally think about go-to-market, structuring their team, and their processes.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Another role is for people who are thinking about starting a company. You can do the entrepreneur-in-residence route, where you spend time at a venture firm helping them think about the industry, helping them develop a perspective, and helping them with a thesis around a particular opportunity. You use your expertise to help them make investment decisions and then potentially start your own thing.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1111" style=";color:black;"></a>
 How might a PM know if a role at a VC firm might be good for them?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Venture capital isn&apos;t right for everyone. It&apos;s important to understand the difference between being a hands-on product manager and being in a venture firm.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The first thing is that venture capital is kind of a lonely job. You don&apos;t work with a team; you&apos;re on your own.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The second thing is that as a PM you get used to being accountable for your product. In venture, you&apos;re a step removed from the important decisions, and for good reasons.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">A mistake that former product people make is they try to act like they&apos;re still product managers. They&apos;ll either try to run the products or do a &quot;swoop and poop,&quot; where they go way too deep into product decisions and then disappear to go spend time with other companies. That can really distract and randomize the companies.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As a VC, you are the steward of other people&apos;s capital. Your primary job is to make sure that capital makes money. You should be a resource to your companies when they need you. One day, you might help them hire a VP of Sales, the next day, you might connect them to another CEO to unlock a partnership, and the day after that, you help them raise the next round of fundraising. You have to be a Swiss Army knife.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">One area PMs struggle with is the long-term perspective. The exit is what really matters in the long term and it takes five to seven years to know the exit.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Anything that feels measurable in the short term is not the thing that really matters. No one is going to care in ten years if your portfolio had a killer product that was incredible but it failed. What really matters is whether it was a good investment. You are ultimately measured by whether you return money to your LPs.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">

 What advice do you have for PMs who want to advance in their careers?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Luck is a big part of it. People who joined super fast growing companies right before the company exploded saw their careers take off. They were great, but they were also strapped to the side of a rocket ship.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">My advice to earlier stage PMs is to find a strong brand that’s growing. It&apos;s going to give you lots of opportunity for growth. You&apos;re going to get to live and learn so much faster because you&apos;re faced with the challenges of scale and growth. Chances are you&apos;ll be surrounded by other great people that you can learn from. And, those people will go on to do great things elsewhere. They&apos;ll become part of your network later in your career.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Flexibility is also a big part of it. Really good PMs find important things that need to be done and volunteer to lead them. I&apos;ve seen people say, &quot;Hey, our customer experience is bad. I&apos;m going to raise my hand to go build the customer experience team for the next year, because that&apos;s the biggest key to us being successful.&quot; You have to be able to contribute in areas that you didn&apos;t consider to be part of your job. If you&apos;re rigid in your view of what a PM does, you&apos;ll miss a lot of the best opportunities in fast growing companies.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As you advance, you have to think about where you&apos;re trying to go and whether the moves you’re making connect with where you want to be in five years. People sometimes go off the rails a little bit caring about the sexiness of the product or their title. As PMs, we fall in love with the product and tend to be blind to the company&apos;s culture, whether a business can be built around that product, and whether there&apos;s access to the capital necessary to continue building. And, especially if you&apos;re coming from a company like Google or Facebook, you can get a VP title anywhere, but you might have less impact than what you&apos;re doing now.</p>
