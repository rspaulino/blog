<span class="AllCaps-Bold _idGenCharOverride-1">A launch can</span>
 feel halfway between a beautifully orchestrated symphony and that moment when the pinata breaks open, the kids rush at the goodies, and you just hope there are no lasting injuries.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">On one hand, you have a series of <a id="_idIndexMarker291"></a>
 partnerships, with lots of proactive communication and collaboration. Teams are working in sync with each other, with one team picking up where another team left off. Marketing is preparing the blog post, while design polishes up the final screenshots, and engineering is squashing the last few critical bugs.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">But at the same time, it can feel frantic and rushed, with many late nights. Teams are trying to do their part and not let each other down, but cuts will nearly always have to be made. Perhaps engineering isn&apos;t able to get that feature done, and so marketing and sales have to tweak their work. You might discover a major issue at the last minute and have to face the gut wrenching decision of whether to move the launch date.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">And somebody has to make sure that nothing gets left behind.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">

</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A launch is a pinnacle moment for your execution skills. All eyes are on you, waiting to see if you can pull off something spectacular. Your first products might go out into the world with just a blog post and a help article. As you hone this skill, the complexity of your launches can grow, and someday you could be standing on a stage in front of an audience of customers, partners and journalists, announcing your latest product.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor326" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Concepts and Frameworks</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor327"></a>
 Launch Review</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">After your team has been working for months and the code is finally done, can you go ahead and ship your new feature to customers? For most sizable features and products, you still have one more step: a meeting with senior management called the launch review.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The launch review is the meeting where you&apos;ll (hopefully) get the final approval to ship your product. It&apos;s a good idea to hold this meeting several days before your launch date, so you&apos;ll have time to address the issues that inevitably come up. It&apos;s usually okay to take your product to launch review before it&apos;s 100% final, as long as you can clearly let the reviewers know which parts are still in progress.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you&apos;ve been working closely with the approvers and sharing <a id="_idIndexMarker292"></a>
 demos and data along the way, the meeting might be an easy run-through of the product and a quick review of the launch plans and marketing material. The reviewers will likely catch a few small bugs and point out opportunities for improvement. You&apos;ll then work with your team to decide which bugs and ideas to squeeze in before launch.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When you work more independently, the launch review can have more surprises. If you&apos;ve run an <a id="_idIndexMarker293"></a>
 A/B test, this may be the meeting where you present your results and the reviewers decide if the results are strong enough to justify a launch. If your company has a large group of reviewers from different departments, you might learn belatedly that one of them has an issue with the launch. Sometimes you&apos;ll be dismayed to hear the entire premise and approach of your product questioned.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">No matter what happens, stay calm, and don&apos;t take it personally. Remember that the reviewers share the same goals as you—just with their own perspective. Everyone wants to launch great products quickly, and no one wants to waste work. Once it&apos;s clear that everyone shares the same customer and business goals, you can have a logical discussion about how to address the concerns and the tradeoffs involved.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It&apos;s a common mistake to overreact or underreact to executive feedback, so take the time to understand whether their feedback is just an idea, a strong suggestion, or an order. Even when the feedback is closer to a direct order, you&apos;ll still have the flexibility to explain the tradeoffs (perhaps they didn&apos;t realize their idea would add three weeks to the schedule) and propose alternate solutions.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor328"></a>
 Launch Checklist</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">One of the most common reasons for a failed launch is that something gets left behind. A launch checklist can be your savior. Start by considering these areas:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1"><a id="_idIndexMarker294"></a>
 <span class="CharOverride-1">Rollout plan</span>
 : What is the launch date and time? Will it start with an <a id="_idIndexMarker295"></a>
 A/B test, <a id="_idIndexMarker296"></a>
 beta program, or will it go out slowly in a staged rollout?<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-002-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00019.html#endnote-002">2</a>
</span>
</span>
 Which systems need to be pushed and in which order? How long does each deployment take? When in the timeline does the marketing go live? Will you reserve a conference room on launch day (a &quot;war room&quot;) so everyone can be available to handle any issues?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Product</span>
 : Has the product been thoroughly tested and been put through any necessary QA? Is there in-product onboarding? Is it available on all platforms? Is it <a id="_idIndexMarker297"></a>
 internationalized? Has it gone through all the launch reviews? You will probably want to create a separate testing checklist to make sure you consider all the important flows and corner cases.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Logging:</span>
 Is all of the logging in place so you can analyze the success of the launch and learn how people are using the new functionality? Have you tested the logging to make sure it&apos;s working as expected?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Infrastructure</span>
 : Have you reviewed the changes with all of the relevant infrastructure teams (security, stability, site reliability engineers, etc.)? Should you do a dark launch to test the stability?<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-003-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00019.html#endnote-003">3</a>
</span>
</span>
</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Other reviews</span>
 : Does this need any other reviews, such as from the legal or finance teams?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Marketing</span>
 : Are all of the go-to-market materials ready? How will potential users learn about the launch? Will there be a blog post, press release, <a id="_idIndexMarker298"></a>
 email campaign, or larger launch event? Does the app store listing need to be updated? Is the positioning consistent with the launch goals?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Sales and Support Enablement</span>
 : Do they have the training they need? Is documentation updated? Do they need new collateral or videos? Do they need new internal tools?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Other systems</span>
 : Do any other internal systems need to be updated, such as billing systems?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Company communication</span>
 : Will you send out a launch announcement? Will there be a launch party?</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Ideally, your team already has a standard launch checklist that you can use. If not, work with your team to create one yourself.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor329"></a>
 <a id="_idIndexMarker299"></a>
 Go-to-Market (GTM) Strategy</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Launching a product involves a lot more than simply pushing your app to the app store. How will people know it&apos;s there? Why will they choose it over all the other apps?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A go-to-market strategy is the plan, usually owned by product marketing, of how to launch a product to customers. It focuses especially on how to reach customers and how to achieve a competitive advantage. Most of the GTM strategy is developed long before the actual launch, using the skills found in <a href="text00025.html#_idTextAnchor452">Chapter 16: Strategic Framework</a>
 .</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As the launch approaches, you and your product marketer will work to finalize the messaging and plans.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor330"></a>
 <a id="_idIndexMarker300"></a>
 Positioning Statement</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You&apos;ve heard these before: &quot;It&apos;s Uber for photography&quot;, &quot;It&apos;s Pinterest for meditation&quot;, &quot;It&apos;s Khan Academy for cats.&quot; Those are positioning statements.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">For product teams which need to align product, marketing, and brand, a positioning statement is an elevator pitch that articulates how you want customers to view your product. Unlike a mission statement, a positioning statement frames the product within a known category and against the competitive landscape.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-004-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00019.html#endnote-004">4</a>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here&apos;s a popular template created by Geoffrey Moore in <span class="CharOverride-2">Crossing the Chasm</span>
 :</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">
<span class="CharOverride-1">For</span>
 (<a id="_idIndexMarker301"></a>
 target customer)</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Who are dissatisfied with</span>

 (statement of need or opportunity),</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Our product is a</span>

<p class="BODY_Quote">
<span class="CharOverride-1">That provides</span>
 (key problem-solving capability).</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">

 (the product alternative)</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">
<span class="CharOverride-1">We have assembled</span>
 (key whole product features for your specific application / key differentiators).</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Positioning statements are important because potential customers and users aren&apos;t going to take the time to understand your full product vision. Instead, you want every customer touchpoint, from <a id="_idIndexMarker302"></a>
 online ads, to in-product education, to keynote speeches to reinforce the same message. You want that message to be perfectly honed so the person who hears it says &quot;Yes! I do have that problem and I do want that solution!&quot;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Take the time to align with your extended team on a positioning statement before any launch materials get created. All of the other go-to-market materials, from ad copy, to sales talking points follow from that statement.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor331"></a>
 <a id="_idIndexMarker303"></a>
 Promotion</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">How will people learn that your new product exists? If you work at Google or Facebook, the press will be eager to hear about each of your launches and you can usually cross-promote between products. For the rest of us, we need to dedicate special attention to promotion.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There are many ways (channels) to promote a product. Here are a few to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1"><a id="_idIndexMarker304"></a>
 <span class="CharOverride-1">Online ads</span>
 like search ads (search engine marketing or SEM) or social media ads. It&apos;s easy to track the cost and effectiveness of online ads since you&apos;ll know if someone clicked on the ad and whether they eventually became a customer. Which keywords will you target?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Public relations</span>
 (PR). Can you interest the press in writing an article about your launch? Which publications does your audience read?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Search engine optimization (SEO).</span>
 Many companies try to rank their webpages at the top of search results by providing widely useful content, such as StitchFix&apos;s fashion blog.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Blog posts, email campaigns and social media</span>
 . These channels help you reach your existing user base to tell them about new features or products. To get the best results, you&apos;ll want to have happy <a id="_idIndexMarker305"></a>
 reference customers.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Events, conferences, and tradeshows</span>
 . For large launches, an event can help pull press and customers together to gain more attention and make a bigger splash.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1"><a id="_idIndexMarker306"></a>
 <span class="CharOverride-1">Partnerships</span>
 . Launching with partners, especially for platform products, can make a big impact. It&apos;s hard for customers to imagine how a platform will benefit them until they see what partners have built on top of the platform.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Distribution</span>
 . Could your product be promoted by another company or come preinstalled with another product? This can be an expensive approach, but can lead to massive reach.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Sales</span>
 . Will you have a sales team following leads (potential customers) or reaching out to potential customers? What materials will they need to support a sale? How will you generate leads?</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">For most launches, you&apos;ll want to use a mixture of channels based on the customers you&apos;re targeting, the cost of the channel, and the effectiveness of the channel.</p>
<p class="BODY_Sidebar-Heading" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor332" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <a id="_idIndexMarker307" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Reference Customers</p>
<p class="BODY_Sidebar" style=";color:black;">Reference customers are happy customers who got early access to your new product and are willing to give testimonials about how wonderful it is. These customers can be quoted in your press release, featured in case studies, or even invited on stage during a launch event. They serve as social proof that your product works.</p>
<p class="BODY_Sidebar" style=";color:black;">To develop reference customers, invite potential reference customers to a pre-launch <a id="_idIndexMarker308" style=";color:black;"></a>
 beta of the new product and pay close attention to their feedback. Communicate frequently with them and invest in the relationship. You&apos;ll want to start with several potential reference customers, in case one of them ends up having unique requirements that you won&apos;t address before launch.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor333" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Responsibilities</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor334"></a>
 Don&apos;t launch until the product is ready</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As the launch date approaches, the pressure mounts. Be careful: don&apos;t let your eagerness to launch cause you to ship a product that flops.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Drew Dillon, a product leadership consultant and former CPO, shares:</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">A great product launch needs happy customer references. Execute a beta program and dedicate sprints to get to a target satisfaction level.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Running <a id="_idIndexMarker309"></a>
 A/B tests or beta programs will give you a wealth of information you can use to predict success. If customers don&apos;t seem to be loving your product or the changes seem to be a loss, take some time to iterate and improve. It&apos;s better to push the launch date out by a few weeks than to release something you know won&apos;t succeed.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor335"></a>
 Ensure nothing falls through the cracks</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There are too many moving parts during a launch to keep them all in your head. As you&apos;re working through the launch checklist with other people, take a &quot;trust, but verify&quot; approach. Make sure it&apos;s clear who is responsible for each piece and when it needs to be ready. You might want to set up regular meetings to check in on everyone&apos;s progress and make sure nothing has fallen through the cracks. The <a id="_idIndexMarker310"></a>
 RACI/<a id="_idIndexMarker311"></a>
 DACI framework <a href="text00032.html#_idTextAnchor583">(see Step 2: Clarify the decision-maker and other roles in Chapter 21)</a>
 can help make roles clear.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor336"></a>
 <a id="_idIndexMarker312"></a>
 Quality assurance</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Even if you have a QA or Test team (which not all companies do), you should be involved in creating the test plan and you should run through the most important flows yourself. You want to look beyond just software bugs to find anything that could hurt the user experience.</p>
<p class="BODY_Sidebar-Heading" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor337" style=";color:black;"></a>
 It could have been bad!</p>
<p class="BODY_Sidebar" style=";color:black;">Natalia Baryshnikova, former Head of Product Management at SmartRecruiters, once did a roll out of her product for a big Australian company. Everything had passed QA, but she noticed the final screen said, &quot;Congratulations, we&apos;re rooting for you!&quot;</p>
<p class="BODY_Sidebar" style=";color:black;">Having worked across different cultures, she knew colloquial phrases could be problematic and double checked with the customer. As It turns out, that phrase is a bit obscene in Australian slang, and it was a good thing she caught it!</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here are some approaches to <a id="_idIndexMarker313"></a>
 quality assurance:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Team Review</span>
 : Sit down with the designers and engineers and slowly walk through the entire product and every corner case. The engineers should help guide the review to make sure all of the code paths are tested.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Internal</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-1"><a id="_idIndexMarker314"></a>
</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-1">dogfooding</span>
 : From the phrase &quot;Eat your own dogfood,&quot; this is when your team uses the product while it&apos;s in development. Sometimes you need to get creative with how to get people to dogfood if it isn&apos;t a product they would normally use. For example, ordinary Googlers don&apos;t have much reason to run ads, so at various points, Google has given employees a small amount of money to put towards AdWords. Make sure to give people a clear place to share any bugs or feedback that they have.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1"><a id="_idIndexMarker315"></a>
 <span class="CharOverride-1">Testing bash</span>
 : Invite a bunch of coworkers to help you test. You can assign each person a specific area to test, for example a certain browser or part of the app. You might want to bring snacks and have prizes for the most bugs found.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Testing scripts</span>
 : A step-by-step plan of each flow and corner case to test. You can invite your whole team to help brainstorm cases to include.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Run through it all yourself</span>
 : Always make sure you&apos;ve tested the product yourself. You&apos;re the most familiar with how your product is supposed to work, so you&apos;ll be able to spot problems that everyone else missed.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Pay special attention to:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">End-to-end flows with a beginner&apos;s mind</span>
 : During development, you often try out each piece independently. But sometimes, when they all fit together, something is still missing or goes wrong, especially from a usability perspective. Try to imagine you&apos;re a beginner with no product familiarity and walk through from end-to-end.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Each of the different flows</span>
 : If the product works differently for users who are logged in versus logged out, or for premium versus free, make sure to test each of those flows.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Common cases that don&apos;t get internal</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-1"><a id="_idIndexMarker316"></a>
</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-1">dogfooding</span>
 : Consider what parts the dogfooders will miss (e.g., new user signups, empty states, upgrade flows, or onboarding).</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Corner cases</span>
 : The corner cases will be unique for each product. Consider the surprising states the user can get into, like having an empty name field or putting a lot of data into the system. Also, consider various error conditions like entering invalid input, or losing internet connectivity.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Design details</span>
 : Is the alignment and spacing correct? Are the images sharp? Are all of the hover states and animations working? Does the design match up with the mocks?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Devices</span>
 : For web apps, test them in different browsers and with different screen sizes. For mobile apps, test on each supported platform and size. Many at tech companies use Chrome on a Mac, but that&apos;s not true for all users or customers; make sure you&apos;re using Safari, Firefox and Edge as well.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1"><a id="_idIndexMarker317"></a>
 <span class="CharOverride-1">Internationalization</span>
 : You&apos;ll generally want to test using German (to make sure long words don&apos;t display poorly), Japanese (to make sure double-byte characters can render), and Arabic (to make sure right-to-left languages display correctly). You&apos;ll also want to try entering accent marks and emojis to make sure they&apos;re stored and displayed correctly.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It&apos;s important to create a &quot;we&apos;re all in this together&quot; atmosphere towards bug finding and fixing. Even if you have a dedicated test team, the more eyes you have the better.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor338"></a>
 Handle any <a id="_idIndexMarker318"></a>
 launch problems</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Imagine it&apos;s <a id="_idIndexMarker319"></a>
 launch day, and something has gone wrong! The app crashes. The download button goes to an empty page. Users are writing angry tweets. Yikes!</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here are some best practices for handling launch problems:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Take a deep breath. Make sure you&apos;re in the right mindset to problem-solve without assigning blame. You&apos;ll want your team focused on fixing the issue, not feeling defensive.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Bring the key people into a room or video chat together to discuss the problem and potential solutions. Having other people to think through the problem with you can help prevent a hasty mistake. A shared room reduces miscommunications and helps you move quickly.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Let your manager know. Proactive communication will do a lot to build trust, and they may be able to help you.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Consider whether you should roll back the change. How bad are the problems? Can you roll it back without harming customers? Have marketing materials already gone out to customers who will be looking for the new changes? If you&apos;re rolling back the change, make sure you pause any future promotions such as in-product announcements or email blasts.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Can you &quot;cherry pick&quot; a quick fix? Work with the engineers to see if there&apos;s anyway to bypass some of the standard processes to get a fix in quickly. Be careful though; many times skipping tests to push a quick fix for a small bug accidentally causes a larger bug. If your app is in an app store, you may be able to reach out to ask for quicker approval of your new release.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Work with your marketing team on how to reply to customers. Make sure customer service representatives and social media managers have the new messaging.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Once everything is settled, hold a retrospective or &quot;5 Whys&quot; <a href="text00011.html#_idTextAnchor167">(see Five Whys)</a>
 to identify the root cause of what went wrong, and how you can prevent similar problems in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><a id="_idIndexMarker320"></a>
 Launches can be high-stress events, and it&apos;s up to you to stay calm and guide the team through any problems that arise.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor339"></a>
 Celebrate and communicate back to the company</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">After weeks or months of building a product and preparing for a launch, everyone will be eager to hear how the investment paid off. Even people who were not directly involved will want to know how things went and what it all means for the company.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here are some ways to celebrate and inform people:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1"><a id="_idIndexMarker321"></a>
 <span class="CharOverride-1">Launch announcement:</span>
 The day of the launch, send a company-wide message letting people know what was launched (screenshots help) and thanking all of the people who contributed to the launch (including cross-functional partners). If you&apos;re not sure who should be thanked, ask a point person from each team you worked with to gather their list. If you have any early data or anecdotes on how the launch is doing, share that as well.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Launch party:</span>
 This can be as simple as buying cupcakes and inviting people to a conference room (or delivering cookies to people who work from home). For larger launches, you might want a bigger event; talk to your team admin or facilities staff about how to set that up. To make it extra special, write up a toast or small speech to deliver to the team.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Post-launch updates:</span>
 Once you have real data on the success of the launch and have held a retrospective, send another announcement to share. If the news is good, make sure everyone knows about it. If the news is bad, include the key takeaways of what you learned and what it means for the future.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The key to these celebrations and communications is that most people at the company won&apos;t know how to feel about the launch unless you tell them. By properly celebrating, you can improve morale across the company. By honestly sharing launch outcomes, you can prevent people from forming incorrect stories or drawing false conclusions.</p>

 Partner with launch <a id="_idIndexMarker322"></a>
 stakeholders early</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The top complaint that launch partners have about working with PMs is that the PMs don&apos;t involve the partners early enough in the process. Partners need to know about upcoming launches so they can plan their own schedules and give early input. Ideally, you&apos;ll tell them about upcoming launches as soon as the product work is on your schedule.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The most effective way to work with stakeholders is to treat them like true partners, not a service. Make them part of your launch team, rather than treating them as an obstacle or a box you need to check. This increases the communication overhead, but makes them feel invested in the launch.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor342"></a>
 I didn&apos;t loop in stakeholders early enough, and now they&apos;ve identified an issue that will block my launch!</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Breathe. Don&apos;t panic. This can happen to anyone. Let them know you appreciate their concern.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">To resolve the issue:</p>
<ol>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-2" value="1">Bring the stakeholders up-to-date with the goals, context, and priority of the launch.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-2" value="2">Work together to write down options from low risk to high risk, along with the pros and cons of each. Look for ways to mitigate the risk.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-2" value="3">If you don&apos;t agree on an option, escalate the decision. Don&apos;t get emotional or defensive. Stay focused on uncovering what&apos;s best for users and the business.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-2" value="4">Once you have a plan, send an update to stakeholders. Let them know what new information has come to light, what the new plan is, and that you&apos;ll come up with a plan to identify issues like these earlier next time.</li>
</ol>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Take heart that, assuming a healthy company culture, the &quot;blocking&quot; stakeholder has the same end goals as you: successful launch, successful product, and successful company. They might just have a different vision of how to achieve this.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor343"></a>
 Use launch reviews as a way to earn credibility</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">By the time you get to the final launch review, you&apos;re probably feeling impatient to launch.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Be careful, because launch reviews can have a huge impact on your credibility. If you bring a buggy or sloppy product, it will reflect poorly on you.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You can make launch reviews work in your favor if you&apos;re well prepared. Instead of hiding bugs, shortcuts, and other problems, share them proactively. Tell the reviewer what you&apos;re planning to do about each of them. For the problems you don&apos;t intend to fix, explain why. If something new comes up during the review, state that you&apos;ll look into it and prioritize it appropriately.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor344"></a>
 Refine the way you think about launch dates <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As a PM, you&apos;ll often be asked for a launch date. This is not as simple as it sounds. There&apos;s no way you&apos;ll be 100% sure of the launch date.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If the code is all written and you&apos;re planning to launch on Tuesday, you&apos;ll be within a day or two most of the time. The extra day might come from a push that failed or a problem on another team blocking your launch. Occasionally you&apos;ll discover a severe bug that takes more than a week to fix.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you&apos;re talking about a launch that&apos;s planned for three months from now, there&apos;s a lot more uncertainty.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I&apos;ve seen all the following issues occur:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Projects delayed months because the legacy code they touched was more complicated than the engineers had expected.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">One product looked great in design reviews, but when we tried it out with real user data we realized the design was confusing and spent an extra month improving it.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">One time, we built our new features on a new piece of infrastructure that never launched and we had to rewrite half the code.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Another time, we paused work to move several engineers onto an urgent spam issue.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">One feature was a week away from launch when we noticed a data corruption issue that took a few weeks to repair.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In each of these cases, the specific delay came as a surprise. But in the bigger picture, it would have been <span class="CharOverride-2">more</span>
 surprising if all of them had launched on time. Software launches are notoriously difficult to estimate.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">Instead of thinking about the launch date as a single day, think about it as a range of dates, from the earliest you might launch to the latest.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">For each part of the range, make sure you have your team&apos;s full buy-in. Never commit your engineers to dates without their full agreement.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The lower end of the range should be the best case scenario, if nothing goes wrong. To come up with the date consider:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Add in time before the engineering can start—for example, design time, and time learning new technology.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Put a multiplier on the engineering estimates (e.g., one ideal day = two real days). Check with your engineers and other PMs to see what multiplier they recommend.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Check for any planned vacations, offsites, or other non-working days.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Add in time for running <a id="_idIndexMarker323"></a>
 A/B tests or a <a id="_idIndexMarker324"></a>
 beta program. You may also want to share the estimated A/B test start date when sharing your dates.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Add on time for how long the deployment and any other post-code work takes (e.g., translations).</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Consider adding an extra 10 to 20% buffer on top of everything else. Yes, even in the lower end of the range. Good project managers should always assume that something will go wrong.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The middle of the range should be based on your estimate of an average number of things going wrong. Consider:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">What might you learn from user tests, A/B tests, or the beta program? How long would those things take to address?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">What types of problems could the engineering team have, and how much time would they add?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">What are the other risks, and how much time would they add to the project?</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">For the upper end of the range:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Try to figure out the date by which you&apos;re 90 or 95% sure you&apos;ll have launched.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">For a multi-month project, this is usually at least two months after the lower end of the range.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Everyone on the team should agree that if it goes past that date, something went really wrong.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When people ask for a launch date, try to share the range and some examples of what might cause the project to go beyond the best case. When communicated well, this can help build trust and credibility. It shows that your team is trying to move as fast as possible, but also that you&apos;ve planned ahead for what could go wrong.</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">If everything goes perfectly we&apos;ll launch at the beginning of May, but we might learn from the <a id="_idIndexMarker325"></a>
 beta program that we need to build a new onboarding flow, which could move our date out as far as June.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Some people will insist on a date, rather than a range. The <a id="_idIndexMarker326"></a>
 marketing team probably needs to know the lower end of the range so that the go-to-market materials are ready for launch day (although you should really share the whole range so they can plan for marketing across the year). The financial model should be conservative, so use the upper end of the range for the finance team.</p>

 Take responsibility for the end-to-end customer experience <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">April Underwood likes to say, &quot;Shipping code to production is not a launch. A launch is when customers actually understand what it is and why they need it.&quot;<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-005-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00019.html#endnote-005">5</a>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As a PM, you probably won&apos;t drive the areas outside of product, but you can still be an influential partner.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here are some areas to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">The <a id="_idIndexMarker327"></a>
 marketing strategy and positioning</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Pricing and packaging</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Onboarding materials</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Help center documentation</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Sales enablement materials such as talking points and demo environments</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Customer success materials</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">External launch partners</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">External consultants and contractors</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Advertising</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Distribution channels</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">All of these things impact your product, and thus are important to you—even if they aren&apos;t within your jurisdiction. Just as you keep teams like marketing and sales informed about your work, you&apos;ll want to be informed about their progress.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">To be a good, influential partner, first meet with the people driving the decisions and learn about their approach and frameworks. Some people have set processes and timelines, and others might take a more ad-hoc approach. If they already have processes, find the most useful places for you to see work in progress and figure out when it&apos;s most helpful for you to give feedback. If they have a more ad-hoc approach, you might need to put together a timeline to ensure you have a chance to contribute feedback at an appropriate time.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When giving feedback, be respectful of your partner&apos;s expertise, while not underselling your own expertise in the product and problem space.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Simple things to check for are gaps or mistakes, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Does the <a id="_idIndexMarker328"></a>
 marketing strategy assume features that won&apos;t be included at launch?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Does the pricing and packaging cover all types of users?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Are there corner cases that should be explained in the help documentation?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Do the sales talking points include the key things customers have said they care about?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Do any pages on the website need to be updated because of the product changes?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Is the experience consistent, with the same terminology and imagery, across all of the customer touch points?</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Beyond the basics, you can look for opportunities to improve the end-to-end customer experience. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Do you have marketing insights based on the user sessions you did?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Do you have ideas for using launch partners or distribution channels to reach a wider audience?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Are there ways to make the product easier to <a id="_idIndexMarker329"></a>
 demo to customers?</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Share your ideas with your partners, using your knowledge of their approach and frameworks to find a way that could work for them. If your ideas would require a radical change of approach, you&apos;ll need to plant the seeds of the idea early.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor346"></a>
 Get the launch strategy right <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When Nate Abbott launched Airbnb Experiences, he came face-to-face with the tradeoffs around launch strategies.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Airbnb Experiences was a pivotal launch for the company. They were expanding from home sharing to travel, and they needed to reposition themselves in the market. For that goal, a big public launch event was the best strategy. They threw a big party with journalists and shouted their message from the rooftops.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As the product lead, Abbott knew his role would be different in a <a id="_idIndexMarker330"></a>
 marketing-led launch like this. He focused on two things:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Optimizing the product to best help the launch achieve its goals.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Covering every single logistic perfectly.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Being a great PM required setting aside his ego. The marketing message, not the product-market fit, would be center stage. Creating checklists and running a tight ship isn&apos;t glamorous, and in fact can feel quite uncomfortable at times.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Abbott shared how those priorities impacted the product:</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">We didn&apos;t just roll out an entirely new booking system for experiences. We actually re-architected the entire homepage and the way people interact with search on Airbnb.</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">Early on, we had debated having Experiences be a totally separate app, but instead we dedicated a huge amount of product and engineering resources to create an integrated search experience. I had standups with the team every day and a spreadsheet of the red flags that kept me up at night. One of those red flags was that we couldn&apos;t get the animation right on the header bar. I told the team, &quot;if we don&apos;t have this by Sunday, I&apos;m calling a hard stop.&quot; And one of our awesome engineers disappeared and four days later emerged with the perfect header.</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">These details weren&apos;t critical for the product, but they were critical for the launch. They told the company narrative. The CEO could go up on stage and scroll the app itself to show homes and experiences together. The app told the story of the transformation around our trip platform that we really wanted to have.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A big marketing-led launch does have a lot of downsides, however. As Abbott shared:</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">We kept the entire thing under wraps and did not do much market testing with our core market before we launched.</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">We therefore missed some of the key signals—for example, how people were not into three day trips, and instead wanted bite sized afternoon experiences that would work in their existing schedule. It took us two months to adjust to those learnings after the launch.</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">From a product perspective, I wish we could have done a slow <a id="_idIndexMarker331"></a>
 rollout and tested with our existing user base. From the larger perspective however, the success of this launch was measured by whether we&apos;d changed the market&apos;s perception. In this case, the broader story worked, even if the product wasn&apos;t perfect. It was a successful transition for the company.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When deciding between a big marketing-led launch moment (where the date is set in advance and the product is kept under wraps) and a product-led slow rollout (where the product is launched incrementally without any big announcements and marketing materials only go out after the product team says the product is ready), the key is to think about your goals and <a id="_idIndexMarker332"></a>
 target audience. When your goal is to deepen <a id="_idIndexMarker333"></a>
 engagement with your current customer base, there&apos;s not much need for a big launch. When your goal is to enter a new market or change the company&apos;s market perception, a big launch is probably worth the cost</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor347" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Key Takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Launching is a complex, cross-functional process</span>
 : As the PM, you&apos;ll need to make sure every team stays coordinated and on track. Templates are incredibly helpful to ensure you don&apos;t forget about a step.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Treat the launch date as a range</span>
 : It&apos;s impossible to accurately predict when a feature will launch, and guessing incorrectly can cause a lot of problems. Some teams need to know the earliest you might launch so they can prepare supporting materials, while other teams need to know the latest you might launch so they can create conservative financial models. Sharing a range from best case to worst case better conveys the information and helps you build credibility.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Take direct responsibility for the quality of the launch</span>
 : Even if there&apos;s a QA team, you need to try out the product, look for bugs, and make sure the whole thing works end to end. Even if there&apos;s a marketing team, you need to review the launch materials and make sure they&apos;re compelling. Even when you trust your engineers, you need to double check anything that could go wrong with the infrastructure. No excuses.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Treat cross-functional partners as part of the team</span>
 : It takes a lot more than product, design, and engineering to pull off a successful launch. Loop in other teams early, and be open to their influence. Help them feel invested in the launch and give them credit for their work.</li>
