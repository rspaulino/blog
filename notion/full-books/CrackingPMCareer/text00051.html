<span class="AllCaps-Bold _idGenCharOverride-1">While some people</span>
 join product management straight out of college and (aim to) stick with it their entire career, for many others, it ends up being a midpoint in their career. Perhaps they joined product management after a few years of working, and then they transition out of it two, five, or twenty years down the road.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Indeed, the wonderful thing about product management is that it combines so many different and transferable skills. This makes the job complex and ambiguous, but it also means that you have so many options for the &quot;next step&quot;â€”if you choose to do that.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here are some of the more common options.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1049" style=";color:black;"></a>
 General Manager</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">While people say that a PM is <span class="CharOverride-1">like</span>
 a mini-CEO, a General Manager (GM) is truly a mini-CEO. A GM is responsible not only for product teams, but also for the business teams within their business unit. They&apos;re responsible for the full end-to-end success and profitability of their products, including the go-to-market strategy that involves marketing, sales, partnerships, and other teams.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you&apos;re a business-minded PM who loves working across functions to land a product in the market, you might like being a GM. On the other hand, if you get the most energy working on product vision and design and don&apos;t enjoy the operational side, it may not be for you.</p>

 Venture Capital</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><a id="_idIndexMarker869"></a>
 Venture capital (VC) firms raise money from limited partners (LPs), like pension funds, and then invest it in a portfolio of companies. They make money for the LPs when a portfolio company is acquired or IPOs, hopefully for a significant multiple of the original investment. The VCs often advise the companies in their portfolio, and may be given a seat on the board of directors.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There are many different roles at VC firms:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">General Partner / Managing Director</span>
 : The top deal professionals. They raise money, have the final say on which companies to invest in, and become board members. They typically already have a track record of success as entrepreneurs, executives, or experts in their field.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Analysts, Associates, and Principals</span>
 : Junior deal professionals who scout companies, exercise due diligence, write memos, and calculate cap tables. They make recommendations, but don&apos;t get to make the final decisions. Analysts and associates usually leave the firm to work at a portfolio company after a few years.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Operating Partner</span>
 : Generally, the operating partners don&apos;t decide which companies to invest in. Instead, they support the portfolio companies or the VC firm with their specific expertise.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Entrepreneur In Residence (EIR)</span>
 : A 6-12 month role where you&apos;re paid a salary or stipend to explore startup ideas and develop a new venture. The VC firm tries to build strong relationships with the EIR in the hopes of funding the startup.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Hunter Walk, a partner at Homebrew VC and former product lead at YouTube, Google, and Second Life, shared how a PM might know if they&apos;d like being a VC:</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">It&apos;s a love of seeing the future being built. A love of being in the flow of ideas. A chance to be close to the heat of building.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">On the other hand, if you want to stay hands-on building products, you don&apos;t enjoy stakeholder management, or you like tight feedback and learning loops, VC might not be for you. In VC, you don&apos;t learn which decisions were good or bad until many years later. There are also limited advancement opportunities at VC firms; there are very few partner roles, and they are very challenging to get.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Walk also discusses the importance of taking the time to choose the right firm:</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">Some are very collaborative and others are lone wolf. In some, you work closely with each company and others you just write a check. Some firms are trying to rebuild themselves while others are working well. When you&apos;re making a 20-year choice, you should wait a while and cultivate relationships to make the right choice, not just look at the roles that are open to you right now.</p>

 Angel Investor</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">An <a id="_idIndexMarker870"></a>
 angel investor invests their own money in very early stage startups. It&apos;s only feasible if they have the money to invest and connections to entrepreneurs. If they do have that money, it&apos;s a chance to participate in the huge upside of equity, and a chance to support the entrepreneurs they believe in.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">People who love hearing very early-stage ideas, and having skin-in-the-game with multiple companies, might like angel investing. If you&apos;re not comfortable with the risk, it might not be for you.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">For more on the PM to Angel Investing path, see the interviews with <a href="text00064.html#_idTextAnchor1153">April Underwood</a>

 Founder/CEO</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Founding a company is, perhaps, the most common aspiration for PMs. It&apos;s a natural fit, too, because you&apos;re already used to leading teams, thinking about users, and building products.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As the founder of a company, you have a lot of flexibility to shape what your role looks like. You might take on the head of product role and leave the operational side to a cofounder. Or, you might own the operational side and deal with finding office space, paying bills, and hiring a sales team.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Most founders describe the role as incredibly stressful, and argue that you should only attempt it if you feel like you&apos;re the only person who can successfully solve the important problems you want to tackle. They describe struggling through long periods where no one else believed they would be successful, and they constantly questioned themselves. They talk about the weight of being responsible for other employee&apos;s livelihoods and returning investor&apos;s money. They recall nightmare board members who were worse than any boss could be. They lament the frustration of handling all the work that no one else wants to do. They point at their new gray hairs.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">On the other hand, there are serial entrepreneurs who love the role and constantly yearn to get back to their roots. They&apos;ve usually paired up with great co-founders who balance their strengths and weaknesses. They don&apos;t get demoralized easily. They&apos;ve learned from their first startups and are eager to apply that learning again.</p>

<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1053" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Chief of Staff</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The chief of staff is an executive&apos;s &quot;right hand person.&quot; They&apos;re a close confidant of the executive who helps the executive scale. A chief of staff generally gets involved in many projects on behalf of the executive and takes on a few &quot;special projects&quot; to lead directly.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The role can look very different from company to company and executive to executive. Some of the work may include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">improving team processes</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">driving company processes</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">managing investor relations</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">researching strategic initiatives</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">preparing board slides</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">running analyses</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">coordinating cross-functional initiatives</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">running important meetings</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">drafting speeches</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">helping the executive prioritize their time</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you&apos;re interested in a chief of staff role, it&apos;s important to align with the executive on what the role will look like and ensure there&apos;s a good fit. Some people have taken the role hoping for broad strategic exposure, and instead find themselves mostly taking care of administrative duties like scheduling meetings and taking notes. Beyond the responsibilities themselves, it&apos;s important to work for an executive you respect and with whom you have good rapport.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The chief of staff role can be a great career move for someone who wants a broader view of the business. As a chief of staff you participate in senior meetings across the company and see the bigger picture that surrounds the world of product. It can be a stepping-stone to a general manager role or an accelerant for PMs who need more strategic exposure. If you love cross-functional coordination and have the people skills and confidence to work with executives, you might love the chief of staff role.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Jennifer Conti-Davies has moved from product management to chief of staff twice in her career and recommends stints as a chief of staff as a way to broaden your skills.</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">It was a refreshing change to go from a laser focus on the product to a systems view of the organization. As chief of staff, you get a different strategic vantage point which can ultimately make you a better product manager as well.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you&apos;re too early in your career, chief of staff might not be a great match for you. It takes a lot of competence, confidence, and autonomy to be a great chief of staff. Many early-career people are shy around executives or lack the credibility to have the kind of influence they need. Another sign that you might not like the job is if you really love the ownership and accountability of being a PM. As a chief of staff, you&apos;re more often a contributor to work than the owner of it.</p>

<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Product <a id="_idIndexMarker873"></a>
 coaching and <a id="_idIndexMarker874"></a>
 product consulting are paths that capitalize on your PM expertise while gaining independence. Coaches might teach new skills or mentor people through challenges. Consultants step in to fill the PM or product leader role at companies.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you enjoy variety and are looking for better <a id="_idIndexMarker875"></a>
 work-life balance, you might enjoy coaching or consulting. If you really want to stay hands-on and own the results, this might not be for you. Many coaches and consultants are independent and need to handle their own lead generation and business operations, which isn&apos;t for everyone.</p>
