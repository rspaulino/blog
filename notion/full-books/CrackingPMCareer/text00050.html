 product management is constantly changing, and there are always new things to learn. Many great PMs share their insights on Twitter, in blog posts, and in email newsletters. There are meetups and product conferences where product leaders share their hard-earned lessons learned. You can join product communities on Facebook and Slack to connect with other PMs.</p>

<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Beyond those free resources, here are a few paid ones to consider:</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1044" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Courses</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Early in your career, or when you start a new specialization, taking a course can help you gain confidence and familiarity with a product toolset. They&apos;re especially helpful if you don&apos;t have strong product mentors at your company.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Most courses teach materials that you could find online for free, but since the cost of the course should be covered by your company&apos;s training budget, they can be a helpful choice for people who learn better in a class setting.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Not all courses are created equal, however. Ask around to learn if people thought the course was a good use of their time and what the most valuable part was.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1045" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Coaches</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Personalized <a id="_idIndexMarker865"></a>
 coaching is especially helpful as you grow into more senior roles and find yourself getting stuck. A coach can provide a new perspective to help you make progress.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">One product leader found himself stuck on a team <a id="_idIndexMarker866"></a>
 retention problem. He dug in with his coach and they zeroed in on feedback that his reports didn&apos;t feel like they could connect with him. They went deeper and found that he shut down during conflicts. Reflecting on this, he realized conflicts stirred up childhood memories. Once he saw that, he was able to reframe how he saw the work conflicts, connect better with his reports, and improve <a id="_idIndexMarker867"></a>
 retention on his team.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Becca Camp, a product and leadership coach, says that the most consistent advice she gives is around confidence:</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">What gives people confidence is a willingness to experience the full spectrum of human emotion. Confidence is a byproduct of being game to experiment and see the results. Not being afraid to be sad if things don&apos;t turn out the way you want. If we can get comfortable with seeing failure as data and stagnation as the actual enemy, a lot of things will be easier.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Finding a good coach is about fit, so take advantage of the free initial calls that many coaches offer to see what your rapport is like.</p>

 <a id="_idIndexMarker868" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MBA</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Once you&apos;ve already broken into product management, the top benefit of an MBA is boosting your credentials. Enrolling in a respected MBA program can extend your network and open up better job opportunities, especially if you don&apos;t already have a top tier undergraduate school or tech company on your resume.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">MBA programs provide a structured environment where you can learn business fundamentals and practice leadership skills. Those skills are helpful, but you not only pay tuition, you also pay the opportunity cost of your salary over two years.</p>
