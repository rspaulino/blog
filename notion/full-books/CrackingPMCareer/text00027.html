<p class="First-Paragraph---Main-Book">
<span class="AllCaps-Bold _idGenCharOverride-1">Imagine this: it&apos;s</span>
 the end of the quarter, and one of your engineers runs up to you, thrilled to share her work. It took several weeks, but she rebuilt the text editor and now it can handle bulleted lists and emojis.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">That&apos;s great—you wanted those improvements—but… what about the monetization experiment she was supposed to be working on? Revenue hasn&apos;t been doing well and the company really needs a win. &quot;No problem,&quot; she tells you, she&apos;ll get started on it next week after the hackathon.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Next week?! How can she be so calm about this? Why did she think it was okay to work on her own project instead of the one on the roadmap? It turns out she&apos;d heard about the new company initiative to add customer delight and wanted to help out. She hadn&apos;t realized her work on the monetization experiment was more important.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">People commonly run into problems by going after the wrong goals.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Once, I found myself stuck in a surprising disagreement with a designer over whether we needed two more weeks to polish the designs. Neither of us could understand the other person&apos;s point of view until we realized that we had conflicting goals: I was trying to start a small beta program to validate the customer need, and she was thinking about getting the visuals up to our quality bar for a full launch.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Another time, our growth team set a goal to increase adoption by 5% and spent the quarter working on an ambitious experiment that ultimately failed. When we talked to growth PMs at other companies we realized our mistake; we were putting all of our eggs in one basket and not iterating quickly enough. The next quarter we set a goal to run ten experiments and saw much more success.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">As a PM, it&apos;s easy to incorrectly assume that the &quot;right work&quot; is obvious to everyone. PMs think about roadmaps and strategy all day long. The designers and engineers on your team, however, might have looked at the roadmap during a strategy presentation months ago and forgotten most of it. You need a tool to pull the long-term strategy and roadmap into something more tangible that drives day-to-day decisions.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Team goals are that tool.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Once they are written down, shared, and approved, team goals (also called OKRs or commitments) become the guiding light for the team. In a healthy team culture, people <span class="CharOverride-1">really</span>
 want to hit their goals and will work hard to achieve them. Goals align the team towards a shared measurement of success.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor502"></a>
 The importance of setting team goals</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Creating team goals and sharing them with the rest of the company is a well established best practice. The benefits include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Forcing teams to be thoughtful about the purpose of their work.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Supporting cross-team communication, coordination, and alignment. Goals represent a shared set of priorities and are one of the fastest ways to understand what people are working on.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Creating an anchor point for reflection and learning. If you don&apos;t write down your intentions, you can&apos;t tell when you&apos;re exceeding or missing them.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Helping teams make better tradeoffs and decisions.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Creating the nudge that many people need to finish up work and ship it, rather than iterating endlessly.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Enabling product leaders to ensure teams are working towards strategically valuable outcomes.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Establishing clear expectations of what success looks like.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As Yogi Berra said, &quot;If you don&apos;t know where you&apos;re going, you&apos;ll end up somewhere else.&quot;</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor503" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Responsibilities</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor504"></a>
 Create Team Goals</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As a PM, you need to ensure that your team creates good goals that are aligned with the strategy and roadmap. This should be a collaborative process, with the team feeling like they committed themselves to the goals they want to achieve; they should not feel that you imposed goals upon them.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Anything people on your team spend a substantial amount of time on should contribute to a goal.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">That includes the planned product work and engineering investments, plus any responsibilities that are likely to require work (such as &quot;keep the site up&quot;). You don&apos;t usually create goals for internal responsibilities that everyone is expected to do, such as interviews or on-call rotations, unless you&apos;re asking for a shift in this work (more interviews, etc.).</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The standard advice for goals is that they should be <a id="_idIndexMarker427"></a>
 S.M.A.R.T.: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound.</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Specific:</span>
 What are you planning to do, and what will the impact be if it is successful? Be sure that your goal isn&apos;t purely to launch; include outcomes like overall user <a id="_idIndexMarker428"></a>
 engagement, engagement with the feature, or even internal stakeholder satisfaction.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Measurable:</span>
 How will you know if you hit the goal or not? What are the concrete criteria for success? You can add multiple criteria to help your team know what&apos;s important.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Achievable:</span>
 You want the goal to be ambitious, but achievable. This also applies to the set of goals your team is signing up for. Did you sign up for too much work?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Relevant:</span>
 Does the goal contribute to your team or company strategy? If you hit the goal, would you feel good about how your team is doing? Is it clear in the wording of the goal <span class="CharOverride-1">why</span>
 you&apos;re doing it?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Time-bound:</span>
 Goals should always be tied to dates. The dates could be the end of the quarter, or could be the launch date.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If possible, work some flexibility into your goals or the grading process. The spirit of the goal is more important than the actual wording of the goal. It&apos;s silly to get hung up on wording and technicalities, as long as everyone is on the same page about the intention.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor505"></a>
 Good goals and bad goals</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Let&apos;s dig into some examples to see how SMART goals work in practice.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor506"></a>
 Internal <a id="_idIndexMarker429"></a>
 launch</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Bad</span>
 : Create an internal product dashboard (due end of quarter).</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Good</span>
 : Create an internal product dashboard that effectively replaces the legacy script, so that we can remove the legacy script next quarter and improve development speed. Measured by survey of Ops team (due end-of-quarter).</li>
</ul>
<p class="Headings_Heading-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor507"></a>
 Stability and security</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Bad</span>
 : App is stable and secure.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Good:</span>
 Achieve 99.9% uptime and no security breaches during Q1.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Headings_Heading-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor508"></a>
 Growth teams</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Bad</span>
 : Double the user growth rate (due end-of-quarter).</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Good</span>
 : Run 10 experiments focused on increasing user growth rate, with at least one statistically significant win (due end-of-quarter).</li>
</ul>
<p class="Headings_Heading-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor509"></a>
 Feature <a id="_idIndexMarker430"></a>
 launch</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Bad</span>
 : Launch &lt;feature name&gt; (due end-of-quarter).</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Good</span>
 : Launch &lt;feature name&gt; by end-of-quarter, resulting in a 5 point NPS increase measured one month after launch.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-001-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00027.html#endnote-001">1</a>
</span>
</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A good goal keeps the team focused on the right work. By planning ahead you can make sure that everyone on the team has the same definition of success.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor510"></a>
 Ensure the goals are met</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Have you ever suddenly realized, a week before the quarter ends, that you had a goal you forgot about? Maybe it was to create new product documentation or give a public presentation. Perhaps there was some eng debt your team intended to tackle but didn&apos;t get to. It&apos;s not a good feeling.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When you create your goals, set up a cadence of when you&apos;ll check in on the goals. Some goals might be discussed at every team meeting, while others just need to be considered once a month. Set reminders so you don&apos;t forget.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When your team starts to fall behind on a goal or it looks like you won&apos;t achieve it, there&apos;s a lot you can do to help. First, let your manager and other stakeholders know. Then, consider your options.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here are a few ways to get a goal back on track:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Talk to your teammates or other PMs to brainstorm solutions. Two brains are better than one.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Reallocate within your team. Is there a lower priority project that can be paused so you have more people working on the problem?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Clear away other responsibilities. You can help your teammates ask for a reduced interview load or reduction in other activities to help them focus on the goal that&apos;s falling behind.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Ask for more resources. You might be able to borrow people from another team, hand part of the work to another team, get a contractor, or purchase third party software to help.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If it doesn&apos;t look like those approaches will work, see if you can renegotiate the goal to something more realistic.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor511" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Growth Practices</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor512"></a>
 Include counter <a id="_idIndexMarker431"></a>
 metrics in your goals</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Let&apos;s say your team&apos;s goal is to increase new user signups. If that&apos;s your only metric of success, you could easily hit your goal in a way that&apos;s bad for users and the company.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Imagine you offered people $50 to sign up. Signups would sky-rocket, but many of those people only signed up for the free money and won&apos;t return. The leadership team is unlikely to be pleased. What they really wanted was for you to increase signups <span class="CharOverride-1">without</span>
 hurting the <a id="_idIndexMarker432"></a>
 customer acquisition cost (CAC) or decreasing <a id="_idIndexMarker433"></a>
 retention.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">Counter metrics are health metrics that you want to keep an eye on to ensure you haven&apos;t created unwanted side effects, such as CAC and retention in the scenario above. The best counter metrics will be specific to the goal you have and the types of solutions you&apos;re considering.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">For example, let&apos;s say Zoom wanted to improve video quality to increase overall retention. Since the approaches to improve video quality might increase bandwidth which could be a problem, they might want to look at bandwidth usage as a counter metric, or perhaps retention of customers who have lower bandwidth connection. They&apos;d then write the goal as &quot;improve video quality by X% without increasing bandwidth usage.&quot;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">To come up with counter metrics, ask yourself, &quot;Is there a way we could hit this goal but it would be bad for users or the company?&quot;</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor513"></a>
 Use goals to motivate your team <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When done well, goals can be highly motivational. Most people like to hit their goals and will work extra hard if they think it will make a difference. It feels good to accomplish something you said you would. On the other hand, it can feel frustrating to put a lot of work into something that isn&apos;t related to a goal. And, if someone thinks they have no chance of achieving a goal, they might stop working on it entirely.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You can use that bit of human psychology to encourage the kinds of behaviors you want.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As you shape your goals with your team, here are some things to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Paying attention to the incentives which your goals create</span>
 . If people are trying really hard to hit the goals, will they try to cut corners? Try to include criteria that align incentives in the right way. For example, you might want to specify that there are no P0 bugs in the week after launch.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Grouping together small pieces of work into a single goal</span>
 . For example, if your team is going to run ten experiments, you can create one combined goal for all of them. This can help your team focus on the larger impact rather than getting caught up in a single experiment.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Breaking large projects into multiple goals</span>
 . For example, if you can&apos;t set a <a id="_idIndexMarker434"></a>
 launch date until you&apos;ve validated the solution with a beta program, you can create one goal around the beta program, and wait to create the launch goal until after you&apos;ve hit the beta goal. This creates intermediate milestones to celebrate.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Creating separate goals for different types of work</span>
 . Designers love to &quot;clean up as they go,&quot; redesigning bits of the product near the new features they design. Engineers can get frustrated by what they perceive as a distraction from the main goal. An easy fix is to align the team around an additional goal to make some number of design improvements over the quarter. That will help all of the work feel meaningful.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Keep in mind that the scope of your goals should reflect your team&apos;s preferences. Some people like to have really ambitious goals to keep themselves motivated, while others prefer more modest and achievable ones because they hate to fail. Don&apos;t assume everyone shares your preferences, or that everyone thinks about goals the same way.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor514"></a>
 Picking <a id="_idIndexMarker435"></a>
 Targets <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">We know goals need to be measurable, but how do you decide where to set the target? Should you aim for a 10% lift, or a 100% lift?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">On one hand, you might be tempted to set a very low target so that your team can easily beat it and exceed expectations—underpromise and overdeliver. On the other hand, you might want to set a big ambitious goal to motivate the team to achieve more.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When you set targets, you want to consider what the company needs from your team, what your team can achieve, and how the targets will impact decision-making.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor515"></a>
 What the company needs from your team</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">PMs aren&apos;t always proactively told what the company needs from them. Important information (like when the next fundraising round is, what growth rate investors are expecting, or how the monthly finances are doing) is often kept at the leadership level.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you&apos;re not sure, ask!</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor516"></a>
 What&apos;s achievable</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">To figure out what&apos;s achievable, you&apos;ll generally want to compare your planned work to a known baseline.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you&apos;re planning a redesign, look to see how the last redesign impacted metrics, and start from there. If you&apos;re working on improving the <a id="_idIndexMarker436"></a>
 retention rate, see what other work has made a difference, and make an educated guess about where this work might land.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Just as engineers get better at estimating costs over time, PMs get better at estimating impact.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor517"></a>
 How <a id="_idIndexMarker437"></a>
 targets impact decision-making</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">At the end of the day, you&apos;ll need to decide whether you want to err on the side of too low or too high.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you set a high target, you can encourage your team to think of innovative new solutions and make it clear that the team can only succeed if they prioritize this goal. You might also be able to ask for extra resources to achieve your ambitious target. But, if you miss the target, people might be demoralized and you might lose credibility in the organization.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you set a low target, you manage people&apos;s expectations and you have the chance to really impress them if you exceed the target. But, depending on their personalities, your teammates might not work as hard once they&apos;ve hit the target.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor518" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Concepts and Frameworks</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor519"></a>
 <a id="_idTextAnchor520"></a>
 <a id="_idIndexMarker438"></a>
 OKRs</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A popular format for setting goals is Objectives and Key Results, commonly called OKRs.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-002-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00027.html#endnote-002">2</a>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When you write an OKR, the <span class="CharOverride-2">objective</span>
 is your goal or intent. These are often written in the style of a mission statement and might not include specific numeric <a id="_idIndexMarker439"></a>
 targets. An example of an objective could be things like &quot;improve the new user experience,&quot; &quot;successfully launch Version 2 of the product,&quot; or &quot;achieve 90% revenue growth.&quot;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">To avoid confusion about how likely it is that you&apos;ll hit the objective, you can label objectives as &quot;aspirational&quot; when they represent an aggressive target that the team is aiming for but likely will not hit, or &quot;committed&quot; when the team is committing to the result and expected to hit 100% of it. When objectives aren&apos;t labeled, many companies expect the team to hit about 70% of their objectives.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Each objective has three to five <span class="CharOverride-2">key results</span>
 , which are the measurable milestones that contribute to the objective. Key results might look like &quot;improve the onboarding completion rate from 50% to 75% by October 1st,&quot; &quot;launch an experiment every sprint,&quot; or &quot;maintain 99.99% uptime in Q1.&quot;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Many companies create OKRs at multiple levels in the organization. The OKRs at each level can contribute to the OKRs at the level above. In effect, the team objectives are often the key results for the next-higher level of OKRs.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">At the end of each quarter, teams grade their OKRs quantitatively (such as from 0.0 to 1.0) and share the results with their broader group. The grading could be a simple weighted average, a judgment call, or a more complex formula defined when the OKR was first created.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor521" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Key Takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Use team goals to drive cross-team alignment and reinforce strategy</span>
 : When you work with other teams, paired goals can help ensure you&apos;re on the same page about the priority of the shared work. When making tough trade offs, consider how they&apos;ll impact your team goals, and in turn, your team&apos;s progress toward the vision.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Success is more than just launching something new</span>
 : Goals create a focal point for reflecting on how your work went and how you can improve in the future. Make sure your goals capture the positive benefit you&apos;re aiming for, rather than creating bad incentives to launch at all costs.</li>
