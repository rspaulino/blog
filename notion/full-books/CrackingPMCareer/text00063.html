 How did you get into product management?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I was born in Nigeria to middle class parents, but when I was about 15, my dad lost almost all his money. From then on, I resolved to take care of myself. In college, I did a lot of internships and one of them was at a very interesting company. They wanted me to keep writing software for them and paid me what was an extravagant sum for me at the time—enough to pay for me and my brother’s school fees and cover rent for an off-campus apartment.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">After that, I knew I could do really well monetarily in Nigeria, but I felt I needed to leave so I could make my mark on the world. I worked hard and took the GRE, and I got into a couple of schools. But, after getting those acceptances, the US Embassy said I couldn&apos;t go. It nearly broke me.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I decided to try raising money for my first year of school upfront and went to all of my family and family friends with a simple pitch to support my future. I went back to the embassy with the money I&apos;d raised, and someone decided I was okay. I got a student visa, and after my first semester, I got a full-ride scholarship and a masters at USC.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">After my masters, I went to work for a startup and then to work for Microsoft. I started at Microsoft doing high-end enterprise support. I enjoyed it, but it wasn&apos;t really what I wanted to do.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">I knew it would be hard to transition to product management, so I took a product I was working with on the support side. I looked at its weaknesses, coded up a solution, and posted it on the internal tools page of Microsoft. That essentially became my resume, and I became a product manager.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1148" style=";color:black;"></a>
 What was your time at Microsoft like?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As a PM, I joined some of the most complicated projects in Windows and Windows Live. Over my career there, I worked with Office, search, and Microsoft Research, and had twelve patents. At one point, I was so mad that my product wasn&apos;t winning the market that I transitioned to marketing to learn how to tell the story of product. I ran a marketing team for two years and got an MBA at Columbia and Berkeley.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">My big question at Microsoft was:</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">How can I prove to myself that I can solve any technical problem? How do I prove to myself that I can be really original?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This was the reason for the quest for the patents: it was one way I could tally originality. I was looking for a way to say that I could put my stamp on the world, that I could be as innovative as some of the best innovators in the world.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Initially, when I chose my teams, it was all about the problem. The harder the problem, the more original the problem, the more challenge I felt. And the more I thought about it. One time, I came up with a whole new solution to a set of problems while I was in the shower. I evangelized it, and the company ended up spending $20 million to back it.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">Eventually, as I matured, it became more about the people. It became about people I trusted, people that I had good working relationships with, people who could advocate for me and my career. I needed advocates because I saw that I had some managers who were good and some who were horrible and really slowed my career down.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As part of my focus on building relationships, I started a community called Africans at Microsoft. I realized that, in addition to the community of Black people at Microsoft, I also needed people around me who understood the African experience. When you come to the United States, you lose your entire network. It&apos;s an imperceptible lack that you don&apos;t really realize at first.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1149" style=";color:black;"></a>
 What inspired your next moves?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">At the end of my time at Microsoft, I was recruited heavily by a hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates. I&apos;d been at Microsoft for over 10 years. I didn&apos;t feel innovative anymore.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">After a little over a year at Bridgewater, I decided to found a startup that I had been incubating in my head for some time. I felt I was ready, and I felt it was the right time. I did my startup for two and a half years. It mostly failed—while I could keep plugging away at it, I realized the underlying business model wasn&apos;t going to work. I didn&apos;t have enough time and money to pivot out of that, so I folded the company.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Around the same time that I started my business, I created a super <a id="_idIndexMarker900"></a>
 angel group which we call Kernel Fund. Through Africans at Microsoft, I knew a lot of technologists and I knew there was a core group of people who had been looking for opportunities to invest in Africa. So, I basically cobbled that interest together and laid out the rules for how we would operate in collaboration with a few people. I was doing my startup during the week, but on the weekends I would play VC.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">I like to balance my opportunity costs and to start things that I think I want to do long term before I&apos;m fully ready to commit 100%.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It&apos;s worked pretty decently. We have some great investments that are doing really well. We&apos;ve been lucky.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">After my startup folded, I moved to Austin. I joined a smaller company before finding what I thought was my forever company, Atlassian. It just felt much more like home. I was hired to lead the product side of the whole communications division which included HipChat, Stride, and a few other things.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I went into that role because of the people and because it was very connected to some of the things I&apos;ve had a lot of subject matter expertise in. I&apos;ve been working on some form of collaboration tools all my career. Three years in, we divested that business to Slack.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I looked around and found in my inbox an opportunity that turned into Calendly. It&apos;s a very fast-growing company that was almost entirely bootstrapped and was already profitable. The growth upside and the equity upside for me was interesting. It&apos;s a great company and I get to essentially build my dream team.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1150" style=";color:black;"></a>
 What advice would you give PMs who want to advance in their career?</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">I think the first thing is to understand yourself. It&apos;s hard to tell a starting PM to do that because generally when we&apos;re super young, we&apos;re very optimistic about what we are and what we&apos;re good at and what we&apos;re bad at. But I&apos;d say over time, try to understand what makes you happy, what you&apos;re good at, and what you think you can get better at.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Early on, understand that advancement is governed by the approval of people above you. Understand what they&apos;re looking for. Identify it critically. Try to excel at it if it intersects with what you&apos;re good at. Remove all objections to your rapid rise.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">For example, early on in my career, I wasn&apos;t good at writing reports every week. I liked to do the work, but I hated to document it. My manager would say:</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">Documenting is the work. Since you don&apos;t document it consistently, you can&apos;t get promoted. You should work really hard to just document it so that people don&apos;t block you.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I think in your middle career you should look to work with or for people who are advocates for you. Advancement is about more than your competence; now it&apos;s about people who will push you forward.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Then, later in your career, look for opportunities that will, frankly, make you wealthy. Look for things that will help you escape the need to work, if you can.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I always tell young people there&apos;s a trifecta of what should guide your career:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">The first is brand</span>
 . It is governed by the companies you&apos;ve worked for. In my case, it&apos;s ex-Microsoft, ex-Atlassian, ex-Bridgewater. People recognize those names, they have a certain expectation of people who&apos;ve gone through them. It&apos;s very important to align yourself with some of those things. If you&apos;re an immigrant, if you&apos;re a woman, if you&apos;re black, if you&apos;re an outsider of the power dynamics, it&apos;s even more important.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">The second is reputation</span>
 . That&apos;s about you. What have you shipped? What have you built? What are you saying on Twitter? What are you saying on Medium? What are you saying on LinkedIn? What do people know you for? What are they endorsing you for? That is your own thing, and you have to guard it.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">The third thing is money</span>
 .</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you have a perfect triangle of those things, you generally have a good career.</p>
