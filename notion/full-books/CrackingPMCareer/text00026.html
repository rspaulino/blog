<p class="First-Paragraph---Main-Book">
<span class="AllCaps-Bold _idGenCharOverride-1">You&apos;re setting off</span>
 on a long road trip across the country or continent. You pack your bags, prep some snacks and drinks for the ride, load your family and friends in the car, and you&apos;re off. Or are you?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In the days of Google Maps, Waze and other mapping apps, it&apos;s true that you don&apos;t actually need to plan your route. Just punch in your far-off destination and it will indeed route you there—and efficiently, too. Yay.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">But what this approach misses is <span class="CharOverride-1">your</span>
 goals and priorities. It&apos;s optimized solely around getting you to the final place destination as fast as possible. It didn&apos;t consider that you&apos;d like to camp for a few days in a national park, or see the ocean, or visit your friend in Chicago along the way.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It also missed your constraints. You need regular cell and WiFi access, so you don&apos;t want to drive anywhere too secluded. You&apos;ll also need to stop somewhere to sleep each night—and some of those places might need reservations.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It turns out that just blindly setting off toward the final destination (or what you <span class="CharOverride-1">believe</span>
 the final destination to be), doesn&apos;t perform well against your priorities at all. You can go without it for a short trip, but for a longer trip, you need a <span class="CharOverride-1">roadmap</span>
 that takes into account your goals, constraints, and priorities.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">A product roadmap is much the same. Driving toward the final product might get you there eventually, but &quot;there&quot; might not be the right place at all. And it&apos;s often essential, particularly for a bigger project, to make a number of &quot;stops&quot; along the way.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As a PM, you&apos;re responsible for deciding what work your team will pick up, and in what order. You&apos;ll need to balance competing priorities and connect your plans to your strategy and vision to ensure you&apos;re headed in the right direction and can achieve your goals. This is what your roadmap does.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor476" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Responsibilities</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor477"></a>
 Prioritize and sequence work</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Creating a roadmap is basically <a id="_idIndexMarker397"></a>
 scoping (see <a href="text00018.html#_idTextAnchor300">Chapter 11: Scoping and Incremental Development</a>
 ) at a larger scale. Instead of figuring out the incremental releases within a project, you&apos;re ordering work across multiple projects and a larger period of time.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Despite the proliferation of prioritization frameworks, there is no single objectively correct way to prioritize work. Prioritization is about tradeoffs, and it requires sound judgment.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It can be useful to create a table of the factors you&apos;re considering, and even to give each factor a weight. But don&apos;t blindly rely on the score. When you do this, you can wind up pursuing the wrong path, or wasting hours trying to refine your calculations until it gives the results you want. The tradeoffs between options are real, and purely quantitative calculations can miss that.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">With all of those caveats, here are some factors to consider. They can be further subdivided, or grouped together to help highlight the differences. At the simplest, you could look at cost/benefit analysis.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor478"></a>
 Estimated benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Dissatisfiers / Satisfiers / Delighters (The</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-2"><a id="_idIndexMarker398"></a>
</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-2">Kano Model):</span>
 How unhappy are people if the functionality is missing, and how happy are they when it&apos;s there? Make sure you first provide the table-stakes features, and only then invest more in the areas where you haven&apos;t hit diminishing returns.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Size of user benefit:</span>
 Sometimes you can directly measure a customer benefit like &quot;seconds saved&quot; or &quot;money earned.&quot; Other times, you can estimate it at small, medium, or large, based on customer requests and what you&apos;ve learned from in-person interviews.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Number of users who benefit:</span>
 What percent of the user base benefits? To estimate the number of users impacted, you can measure how many users visit the part of your product where the new entry point would be; it might be much smaller than you assumed.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Type of users who benefit:</span>
 How important are the users who benefit? Sometimes, a small slice of the user base contributes disproportionately to <a id="_idIndexMarker399"></a>
 revenue and growth.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Completeness of use case:</span>
 Satisfying a use case completely is significantly more valuable than <span class="CharOverride-1">almost</span>
 satisfying a use case. If your product is excellent for a single use case, people will use it more frequently than if it is just okay for many <a id="_idIndexMarker400"></a>
 use cases.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Size of business benefit:</span>
 How much money is it estimated to bring in? Will it cut down on support costs? Does it help complete a <a id="_idIndexMarker401"></a>
 marketing story?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Size of internal benefit:</span>
 Will it reduce future engineering cost? Will it improve team morale? Will it help the team learn something important?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Progress towards vision:</span>
 Is this an important part of the long-term vision?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Risk/certainty of success:</span>
 Is this a risky bet? Or is it well validated and likely to deliver the expected impact?</li>
</ul>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor479"></a>
 Estimated cost and constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Size of engineering (and design, product, research) work:</span>
 What is the estimated number of days or weeks that the work will take to complete?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Team capacity and skills:</span>
 Has the team done work like this before? Will you have the right people to do this work well?</li>

<span class="CharOverride-2">Within-team</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-2"><a id="_idIndexMarker402"></a>
</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-2">dependencies:</span>
 Are there other pieces of work that need to be completed first? Are there pieces of work that should be done at the same time to avoid switching costs?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Costing risk:</span>
 What&apos;s the chance that this work could be much more costly than originally estimated? Are there significant unknowns? Are there cross-team <a id="_idIndexMarker403"></a>
 dependencies?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Other risks:</span>
 Could this work introduce security, scalability, performance, or brand risk? Is it a complex project where a lot could go wrong?</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When you look at your final prioritization, make sure that you&apos;re tackling enough important work and not just &quot;snacking&quot; on the low cost/low benefit work.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">

 Ensure your work aligns with the strategy <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="BODY_Sidebar-Heading" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor481" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Taking a Step Back</p>
<p class="BODY_Sidebar" style=";color:black;">Adriana was a senior PM at an enterprise company when a customer asked for some new APIs. The APIs would have been cheap to build and would have strengthened the customer relationship, but Adriana took a step back to see how the work connected to the strategy.</p>
<p class="BODY_Sidebar" style=";color:black;">She knew that revenue was the top strategic goal, and saw this API would not help revenue. Digging deeper, she realized it would actually hurt revenue because it would compete with a new product that was launching soon. Instead of building the API, she demoed the new product for the customer, and they loved it. By focusing on the strategy, Adriana avoided accidentally hurting sales for the new product.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As you plan your work, connect each project to the strategy explicitly.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">If a part of your work doesn&apos;t connect, treat it seriously. <span class="CharOverride-1">Do not</span>
 plow ahead on the part of the strategy that doesn&apos;t connect; you&apos;d be investing effort in something that the company doesn&apos;t think is valuable, and it will hold back your career.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Instead, see if there&apos;s a way to connect the dots from the goals you care about to the strategic goals. If not, discuss it with your manager and see if the strategy needs to be updated.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor482"></a>
 Create a long-term roadmap for your team <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There&apos;s a great deal of debate in the tech community about long-term roadmaps. Some people worry that they&apos;ll be locked into dates, feature sets, or solutions that don&apos;t make sense. They worry it will prevent them from adapting and learning on the go.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Those are valid concerns, as these issues can happen when roadmaps are used poorly. Luckily, there are ways to create and use roadmaps that avoid those problems and create huge benefits.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Roadmaps are important for a lot of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Seeing the bigger picture:</span>
 Roadmaps offer a bigger picture that let you double check that all of your small decisions add up to something important and impactful. For example, you might realize that at your current pace, you won&apos;t be able to catch up with competitors before your startup runs out of funding.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Planning:</span>
 Roadmaps let you plan ahead for the resources you need. For example, you might realize that you&apos;ll need to hire another data scientist in the next six months.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Advocating for resources:</span>
 A convincing roadmap can help you advocate for getting a large enough team. When you ask for more people, leaders will want to know what you&apos;ll achieve with them.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Supporting partner teams:</span>
 Teams like marketing often need a headstart on big launches. Sales teams will set their targets based on the launches they&apos;re expecting. If you don&apos;t share your roadmap with partners, they&apos;ll make their own guesses, which may be much less accurate.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Starting important discussions:</span>
 For example, you might have assumed that applying machine learning to your product was low priority and put it far out on the roadmap. But when you showed it to your team, they were able to point out why it&apos;s important to start investing sooner in this.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Future-proof decisions:</span>
 By showing people what changes are coming, they can make sure to account for them in their current work. For example, if you expect to rewrite part of the app soon, people will know not to invest too much time polishing the old version.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Motivate the team:</span>
 People move faster when they&apos;re excited about what&apos;s coming next.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Recruiting:</span>
 People like to join teams when they&apos;re excited about the things they&apos;d work on. When you can talk about what&apos;s on the roadmap, it becomes easier to recruit and close candidates.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here are some tips to avoid the pitfalls of roadmaps:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Don&apos;t treat your roadmap as set-in-stone. Make sure the documentation reflects that uncertainty.</span>
 Invest in setting expectations upfront, so you avoid undue pressure later. For example, your time buckets can be &quot;now, next, later,&quot; or, &quot;this quarter, next six months, next year,&quot; to reflect time uncertainty. The items can be written as problems to be worked on, rather than specific solutions. You can point out the milestones when you&apos;re expecting to learn more and solidify future plans. Be explicit on the roadmap that these are estimates, rather than firm commitments, and that plans will change as you learn new information.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Revisit the roadmap regularly, particularly when new information comes in.</span>
 Just because you set your GPS, that doesn&apos;t mean you have to plow ahead when a road is closed. Depending on how fast your environment changes, you might want to revisit your roadmap every three to six months, and, of course, whenever there&apos;s major new information (which could be anything from a launch that didn&apos;t achieve its goals to a competitor making a big announcement).</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Double check how people are using your roadmap to make sure it matches your level of certainty</span>
 . At many companies, people will understand that the roadmap isn&apos;t fixed. At others, you might need to hide the details to prevent salespeople from pre-selling features that you&apos;re not committed to. Design your roadmap with the audience in mind.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Group the roadmap by theme, initiative, or goal</span>
 . You can group into rows, or use colors. This lets people understand the roadmap at multiple levels of detail, and highlights the reason for undertaking the work.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Work with experienced engineers to roughly cost the size of investments</span>
 . You don&apos;t need detailed costs, but you must have a discussion about the tradeoffs and choices that would have the biggest impact on costs. Teams can later choose to take a different approach, but they should have a discussion with you if they&apos;re expecting to spend a lot more time on an investment.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Align your roadmap with your strategy</span>
 . Does the planned work match up with the goals? Are there any parts of your strategy which are being missed? Does this roadmap get your team to where you need them fast enough? If you&apos;re not sure what &quot;fast enough&quot; is, work with your manager and business teams to understand the broader company constraints.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Compare your</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-2"><a id="_idIndexMarker404"></a>
</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-2">sprint</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-2"><a id="_idIndexMarker405"></a>
</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-2">backlog to your roadmap</span>
 . If they are diverging, that&apos;s a good time to reflect, decide if you want to change anything, and communicate how things are going.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Roadmaps can be powerful tools—when used appropriately.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor483" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Growth Practices</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor484"></a>
 Don&apos;t overlook the obvious wins</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">PMs tend to be lured by fancy new functionality, but the biggest wins are often obvious and even boring. If you can reliably find the cheap changes that bring big wins, you&apos;ll quickly become a top-notch PM.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I&apos;ve seen PMs score big wins through simple improvements like:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Changing the default setting from off to on.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Fixing bugs in onboarding flows.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Optimizing the very top of the funnel—for example, A/B testing the text and images on the signup page.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Optimizing monetization pages.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Optimizing emails and notifications.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Internationalizing.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">These fixes might not look &quot;cool,&quot; but if they bump up your metrics and help customers, that&apos;s what really matters.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor485"></a>
 Learn how to say &quot;no&quot;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Saying &quot;no&quot; is hard, and it&apos;s not a skill most of us practice regularly before becoming a PM. We&apos;re generally told what to do by those with power—our parents, our teachers, our bosses—and we don&apos;t really have the freedom to say no to them.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Cultural expectations can make it even harder.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Kunwardeep Singh, a senior product manager at Chegg, was born and raised in New Delhi. He states:</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">Culturally, we were taught it&apos;s very rude or harsh to say &apos;no&apos; to elders. In my early product days, I thought the business people knew more than me and I was supposed to say &apos;yes&apos; to their product requests. That led to a lot of <a id="_idIndexMarker406"></a>
 scope creep and misalignment between teams. I had to learn that saying &apos;no&apos; is not offensive; it&apos;s not something bad. I&apos;d ask myself after meetings why I&apos;d said &apos;yes&apos; and learned my own way of saying &apos;no&apos; that worked for me.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here are some tips on how to say no:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Let your roadmap say &quot;no&quot; for you.</span>
 Create a visual roadmap for the next quarter or year and fill it with the planned projects. When someone asks for new work, you can show the roadmap and discuss what would need to be removed to make space. The visual of the roadmap helps you and them understand that you can&apos;t say &quot;yes&quot; for free.<br/>
<img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-1" src="Image00045.jpg" alt="" />
</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Reframe no as a good thing.</span>
 Instead of thinking that you&apos;re letting people down when you push back on their requests, frame it as helping people. You&apos;re helping your team by not signing them up for too much work. You&apos;re helping the requestor by letting them find alternatives and plan accordingly. You&apos;re making decisions that are in the best interests of customers and the business.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Make people feel good about your no.</span>
 Being good at saying no doesn&apos;t mean that you make people feel shut down. Often, when you want to say no to a specific product request, there are many parts that you can say yes to. You can agree and empathize with the problem they&apos;re pointing out, and then share your alternate plans for a solution. You can thank them for a good idea while showing them the roadmap of work that needs to come first. You can ask them to explain their reasoning and then say, &quot;Here&apos;s how I&apos;ve been thinking about it.&quot;</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Learn from people who are good at saying no.</span>
 Each company will have its own nuances to how people say no. Watch if people are blunt or gentle. Ask them how they knew what to say. Keep an eye on what works well and what doesn&apos;t.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Reflect on times you wished you&apos;d said no.</span>
 Ask yourself why you said yes and what you would say if you could go back in time. What would have made it easier for you to say no? You might find that feeling more confident in your customer research or having a more tangible plan for your team would have made it easier.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Set up principles to make saying no easier</span>
 . It&apos;s much easier to say no if you can point to a company-wide principle that explains the decision. For enterprise companies, it&apos;s helpful to have clear guidelines about when the product team will build a feature that only one customer is requesting.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Michelle Thong, Senior Product Manager for Nava Public Benefit Corporation, has found that, in government services, it can be particularly hard to say no. While companies can pick and choose their <a id="_idIndexMarker407"></a>
 target customers, the government needs to serve everyone. Thong saw that government departments would sign up for many more projects than they actually had time to complete.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">To help them accept the need to prioritize and cut some work, she had them write all of their projects, products, and services on a wall so they could see how much there was. When they saw it written down, they realized they couldn&apos;t do it all. She then had them slot projects into the next four quarters so the department could focus on the work that could be accomplished in a year.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor486"></a>
 Don&apos;t panic when <a id="_idIndexMarker408"></a>
 executives torpedo your roadmap</p>
<p class="BODY_Sidebar-Heading" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor487" style=";color:black;"></a>
 A Change to the Roadmap</p>
<p class="BODY_Sidebar" style=";color:black;">Tara had spent months researching customer problems and putting together a roadmap that would deliver the optimal customer benefit. Suddenly, the head of marketing stepped in and insisted they add a handful of splashy features to round out the marketing story.</p>
<p class="BODY_Sidebar" style=";color:black;">Tara pulled out customer quotes, ticket counts, and metrics to show that the features on her roadmap had a higher impact, but the head of marketing wouldn&apos;t budge. How could executives be so unreasonable?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Many PMs face similar situations, but it&apos;s rare that the <a id="_idIndexMarker409"></a>
 executive is actually unreasonable. It&apos;s much more likely that the PM was too much in a bubble and didn&apos;t fully understand or respect the executive&apos;s point of view.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In the example above, did you see how Tara took the narrow view of &quot;customer benefit&quot; and dismissed the value of a complete marketing story?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This is not to say that the executive is always right, but if you want a chance of controlling your own roadmap, you need to show executives that you understand the broader picture.</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">First, <span class="CharOverride-2">back up to the shared goals</span>
 . If you need to, you can go all the way back to the company&apos;s mission statement, and try to find more specific goals you all agree on. Tara and her head of marketing agreed on the importance of a successful launch, which would bring in 20% more premium customers.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Then, <span class="CharOverride-2">find the highest level goal or assumption where you disagree</span>
 . Ask questions and get the executives to explain their point of view. Often, they&apos;ll have extra context or a different perspective that they didn&apos;t realize you were unaware of. Take a stance of humility here—if you&apos;ve already assumed the executive is unreasonable, it will be harder for you to be open to their point of view.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In this case, the head of marketing had a draft of market analysis that Tara hadn&apos;t seen yet, and believed the current offering wouldn&apos;t bring in enough new customers. Once Tara understood that, she decided to work with marketing on a test of the marketing message with and without the splashy features to estimate the impact. They could move forward when they had better data.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If there&apos;s still a disagreement, you have a few options:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Discuss what percent of the roadmap should go to each goal</span>
 . You might find that everyone agrees that 10% is a reasonable amount of time to spend on splashy marketing features.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Highlight the tradeoffs</span>
 . You can put together a few roadmap options to make it clear what will get pushed out if you take on the extra work. When they see the alternative, they might realize it&apos;s not worth it.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Bring leaders with conflicting points of view into a room together</span>
 . Instead of serving as an intermediary, let the leaders talk to each other and hear the concerns directly from each other (while still guiding the conversation and forming a point of view). They&apos;ll have more shared context and more experience resolving conflicts at that level.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Test the assumptions</span>
 . Often, there&apos;s a quick test or data analysis that can help resolve differences.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Set up check-in milestones</span>
 . If there&apos;s no quick test and you need to take on the executive&apos;s project, you can still set up intermediate milestones to validate the work as you progress.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As you discuss and debate, assume the other party is acting in good faith. You probably share the same highest level goals, so now you need to figure out whether you disagree due to different information, different priorities, or something else.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor488"></a>
 <a id="_idTextAnchor489"></a>
 Prioritize competing goals with a balanced <a id="_idIndexMarker410"></a>
 portfolio <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Early in my career, I <a id="_idIndexMarker411"></a>
 prioritized work in a single stack-ranked list. It included new functionality that would work towards our vision, ideas for iteration on past features, small customer requests, and a <a id="_idIndexMarker412"></a>
 backlog of long-term engineering investments we wanted to make. We calculated the <a id="_idIndexMarker413"></a>
 cost and benefit of each... and the new functionality won every time.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Each individual prioritization made sense, but, taken together, the quality of our product was declining.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">At some point, while working on strategy, every PM faces a scenario like this.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">The trick to managing these trade-offs is to treat your strategy and roadmap like a balanced portfolio. Decide at a higher level what percentage you want to invest in each goal.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You might decide that your team should focus 80% on user growth and 20% on revenue. Or, you may split your roadmap to be 30% on customer requests, 50% on big bets, and 20% on engineering debt. One common split that Google made famous is 70/20/10: 70% on sustaining the core business, 20% on related projects, and 10% on blue-sky big bets.</p>

</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Once you have your buckets, you can <a id="_idIndexMarker414"></a>
 prioritize potential work within each bucket, without having to compare items across buckets.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When you pick the percentages, you don&apos;t need to be too precise with the exact numbers. What you&apos;ll find is that when you present a percentage to your stakeholders, they will have an immediate reaction around which buckets seem too big or too small. As you iterate, you&apos;ll find there&apos;s some split that feels right to you and your partners based on their relative importance and the minimum investment that would be feasible. If you can&apos;t agree, that usually means there&apos;s deeper strategic misalignment on the relative priorities.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There are a few ways to implement the percentages:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Team size:</span>
 Allocate headcount to teams based on the percentages, and give each team one bucket. The benefit of this approach is that each team is empowered to own a priority and if the work from one bucket takes longer than expected, it won&apos;t crowd out work from another one. The downside of this approach is that if one of the buckets is less exciting (like engineering debt), the team that is assigned to it may suffer from poor morale.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Estimated</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-2"><a id="_idIndexMarker415"></a>
</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-2">cost on roadmap/</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-2"><a id="_idIndexMarker416"></a>
</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-2">backlog:</span>
 Put projects on the roadmap so that the estimated costs of projects from each bucket matches the desired percentage. The benefit of this approach is that it works with any sized team, and gives the team flexibility in how they order the work. The downside is that teams might push unpleasant work to the end of the schedule and run out of time to complete it.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Fixed order on roadmap:</span>
 This is similar to the method above, but enforces that the team picks up the high priority unpleasant work first. It&apos;s a little less empowering, but works well if the team has failed to meet their commitments before, or if another team has a <a id="_idIndexMarker417"></a>
 dependency on the work.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Goals:</span>
 Ask the team to set goals for each bucket; review them to make sure that they roughly match the investment for each bucket, are what you want, and are achievable. This can, and should, be combined with the other approaches, to reinforce the connection between the strategy, goals, and actual work.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You need to find the solution that works for each team—and it might vary across teams or over time.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor490" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Concepts and Frameworks</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor491"></a>
 Return on investment</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This is a simple concept, but PMs sometimes forget to use it.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">When creating a roadmap, you need to consider both the expected benefits and the expected <a id="_idIndexMarker418"></a>
 costs of the work. The ratio of these is called the return on investment.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you have one project that you think will bring in $1 million in revenue and another that will bring in $5 million, it might seem like the second project is the clear choice. But, if the $1 million project takes a week and the $5 million project takes a few months, the obvious choice might not be right.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Similarly, if you have a project that you&apos;re very confident will bring in $1 million in revenue with 1 month of work, that could be a better choice than a project that might bring in $2 million in revenue in a month, but could also take six months. This is one of the reasons estimating costs and timelines is important.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Many projects don&apos;t have a revenue projection, but the same thought process applies. Would the project still feel worth it if it took five times as long as you expect? Software estimates are notoriously inaccurate, but over time you&apos;ll develop an intuition for which projects have higher variance.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor492"></a>
 Outcome-based roadmaps</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The idea behind an outcome-based roadmap is that instead of sharing a roadmap that says which features you&apos;ll build in each timeframe, the roadmap says what outcomes you&apos;ll achieve in each timeframe. For example, instead of saying &quot;build new calendar view,&quot; the roadmap would say, &quot;reduce time-to-schedule-an-event by 20%,&quot; or, &quot;build new calendar view to reduce time-to-schedule-an-event by 20%.&quot;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">What&apos;s great about outcome-based roadmaps is that they keep the team focused on the results that matter, and can prevent stakeholders from thinking that the product team is committing to a specific solution. They emphasize the reasons and goals behind the work. This is particularly important if your team doesn&apos;t have a strategic framework or OKRs <a href="text00049.html#_idTextAnchor1009">(see Goals and OKRs in Chapter 34)</a>
 .</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">An outcome-based roadmap is a way to move in the right direction; they help ensure the team doesn&apos;t think just shipping features constitutes success.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The confusion around outcome-based roadmaps tends to be whether they can or should reference solutions at all.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor493"></a>
 Ignore solutions</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As an extreme approach, you could ignore solutions and create your roadmap solely around the goals you&apos;d like to achieve.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A roadmap that only includes goals could work if you&apos;re creating a roadmap that someone else is responsible for delivering, as long as they have a chance to consider solutions and <a id="_idIndexMarker419"></a>
 costs with their engineers before agreeing to it. It gives them the most autonomy over what to build.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You can also use this approach if partners and leaders at the company don&apos;t need more granular timeframes than now/next/later.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This extreme has some large downsides. If you haven&apos;t thought about solutions, it will be hard to know if those goals are achievable at all, let alone in a given timeframe. It also doesn&apos;t give partners the ability to plan their own workloads.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor494"></a>
 Consider solutions but don&apos;t put them on the roadmap</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A less extreme approach is for the product team to think about what features they might build for each outcome, but not write the solutions on the roadmap. The roadmap that is shared across the company only includes the outcomes. Those outside the team won&apos;t get overly attached to specific solutions, but the team benefits from the planning and has a more realistic chance of achieving the results.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If your team has earned trust that they can deliver, or if stakeholders aren&apos;t that interested in the details, this can be an effective approach. This approach works especially well for growth or monetization teams where the specific optimizations don&apos;t really matter, and the solutions really are likely to change based on how each experiment goes.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor495"></a>
 Include outcomes and solutions</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The most general purpose approach is to start with a traditional feature-based roadmap and add high-level goals, outcomes, and a caveat that the solutions might change. With this approach, if the solutions change in a way that will affect partner teams (for example, changing from a big launch of a brand new calendar view to a small bug fix in the existing product), you&apos;ll want to communicate that change broadly so that people don&apos;t make plans around the original solution.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This approach works best when the high-level shape of the solutions matters to the company, for example, when there&apos;s a lot of <a id="_idIndexMarker420"></a>
 partnership work. It&apos;s also the easiest approach to switch to if you currently use feature-based roadmaps. The other approaches require more <a id="_idIndexMarker421"></a>
 executive buy-in and change management. Company leaders usually need to have an idea of what the product teams are working on, and, often, an outcome is too abstract for their purposes.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor496"></a>
 <a id="_idIndexMarker422"></a>
 Voice of the Customer</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">For most of my career, when it came time to create a product roadmap, I worked with customer-facing and business teams—of which there were many—independently. I&apos;d gather the lists of their top requests, and then use my own judgment and understanding of company strategy to decide how to merge the lists. I spent a lot of energy explaining to the support team why I hadn&apos;t <a id="_idIndexMarker423"></a>
 prioritized a revamp of the scripts they depended on, or I&apos;d wonder if I&apos;d been overly influenced by our charismatic salespeople.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">One day, Asana&apos;s Head of Business, Chris Farinacci, excitedly shared an idea with me: What if the <span class="CharOverride-1">business leaders</span>
 took ownership for collecting and ranking the priorities from the customer-facing and business teams into a single list? The business leaders were much closer to the business strategy and would know how to weigh the feedback coming in from each channel. I wouldn&apos;t be obligated to follow the ranked list when setting the roadmap—I could still use my discretion—but, we&apos;d be aligned on the top customer and market needs.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">And thus, the &quot;Voice of the Customer&quot; process was born.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-002-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00026.html#endnote-002">2</a>
</span>
</span>
 It&apos;s had a huge influence on both the success of the work we tackled, and on cross-functional trust and morale.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor497"></a>
 How to Start</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you want to start a Voice of the Customer process for your product, the first step is to pair with the top customer or business leader for the product, as that person will be the one owning it. The primary benefit for them is that they get more strategic control over how product teams interpret the needs coming from business teams, since they decide the ranking of the final &quot;Voice of the Customer&quot; list. A secondary benefit is team morale and accountability. Each person on the business team will be able to see how their top priorities were merged into the ranking and know that those choices were made by people close to them within the organization.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Once the business leader is on-board and has picked a person to run the process, you&apos;ll want to work closely with that person to make sure the results you get are as useful as possible.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here are some tips:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Coordinate the timing, so that the product teams will get the final list of requests in time for their planning cycles.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Make sure the person running the process is excellent at speaking to both business teams and product teams, and can translate between the two. You may want to suggest specific people with whom you&apos;ve worked well in the past.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Work with the person running the process on requests that are too solution-oriented or don&apos;t dig deeply enough to address the customer need. Share techniques you&apos;ve used in the past, and give examples to show why the existing framing is misleading.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Ask to see not just the final list, but also the earlier steps. This includes the individual lists from each team, the calculated ranking, and the changes made by business leadership. Ask questions when anything is unexpected.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Double check that the list includes all of the business team&apos;s top priorities. Sometimes work that benefits future customers (like entering a new market) or internal teams (like billing infrastructure improvements) are high priority but get missed on the lists.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Once you&apos;ve made product plans, communicate to the company how those plans connect to the prioritized Voice of the Customer list. Let people see how many of their top priorities you&apos;re tackling, so that they can gain trust in the product plans and feel satisfied that their investment in the process was worth it.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Be patient with difficulties. As a product person, sometimes it&apos;s hard to remember that not everyone else has the same skills of prioritization, surfacing underlying needs, and connecting those needs to product work. I&apos;ve been shocked on many occasions when a customer-facing person casually brings up a brand new top priority at the end of a meeting because they didn&apos;t realize it was relevant earlier.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It might feel strange to hand this responsibility to another person, but doing so can greatly improve the relationship between product and business teams. Over time, people on the business teams will get better at translating customer feedback into useful product insights, and you&apos;ll be able to rely on them as helpful partners. In the bigger picture, you&apos;re not handing over much control, since you&apos;ll still be able to use your discretion to set the roadmap.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor498" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Key Takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Make a long-term roadmap, even though it will change</span>
 : Some people are afraid they&apos;ll be locked into a long-term roadmap, but proper communication can prevent that. A roadmap is critical because it lets you see if your plans will get you where you want to go fast enough. It gives you and your company the information you need for long-term planning, including hiring more people or adjusting financial plans.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Ordering and prioritizing work takes real judgment</span>
 : Don&apos;t expect a magic formula to do the hard work for you. The cost and benefit of each piece of work is an important input, but you&apos;ll also need to consider the overall balance of investments and any <a id="_idIndexMarker424"></a>
 dependencies or synergies between different projects, as well as the perspectives of customer-facing teams.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Treat your roadmap as a balanced</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-2"><a id="_idIndexMarker425"></a>
</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-2">portfolio</span>
 : You don&apos;t need to compare apples to oranges, such as trying to figure out whether new features or eng debt is more important. Instead, when work goes after competing goals or has differing risk/reward profiles, consider what percentage of your portfolio you want invested in each.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Double check that your roadmap matches your vision and strategic framework</span>
 : Your roadmap is how you make progress towards your vision. When they don&apos;t match up, something is wrong. Perhaps your strategic framework ignored important infrastructural investments or cross-team commitments, or maybe you need to say &quot;no&quot; to non-strategic work.</li>
