<p class="First-Paragraph---Main-Book">
<span class="AllCaps-Bold _idGenCharOverride-1">Patrick wasn&apos;t quite</span>
 sure what he was getting himself into with his first PM job, but he was confident he could figure it out. Things had generally come easily to him.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">His first project was to improve the poorly utilized metrics dashboard. Easy enough; the problems were clear to him. There was a new dashboard startup that all his PM friends were talking about, and he was sure that things would get better if his team moved their dashboard to the new technology.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Some of his more experienced teammates warned against relying on an external provider, but he brushed those concerns aside; they were just too risk averse. Didn&apos;t the company always say they wanted people who took big risks? He wrote up plans for the first version and the engineers got started.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The first launch went well, but a few months later he got an email from the startup—they were shutting down. Their new dashboard would stop working in three months, and the team would have to rebuild it again. This was a disaster. That night, Patrick woke up in the middle of the night, mad at the startup and feeling sorry for himself.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">He wasn&apos;t a bad guy. In a lot of ways, his mindset was pretty typical of new PMs, many of whom come in projecting confidence (while others are much the opposite). Nonetheless, without some significant course correction, he wasn&apos;t going to be able to learn from his mistakes. He needed to practice being a good leader, not just for others, but for himself too.</p>

 Growth Mindset</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In Satya Nadella&apos;s first six years as CEO of Microsoft, he transformed the company <a id="_idIndexMarker441"></a>
 culture and added more than a trillion dollars to the company&apos;s valuation. How did he do it? By embracing the philosophy of growth mindset.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-001-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00030.html#endnote-001">1</a>
</span>
</span>
 Satya explains, &quot;We went from a culture of know-it-alls to a culture of learn-it-alls.&quot;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A &quot;growth mindset&quot; means you believe your talents can be developed over time, with effort and persistence. People with a fixed mindset, by contrast, believe they are pretty much stuck with their talents (or lack thereof).</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">To understand the difference, imagine a task that you excelled in. This could be anything. Perhaps this is taking a math test as a kid, or making super cool car-shaped cake for a kid&apos;s birthday, or a triathlon, or a presentation to execs. How do you think about it?</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Growth Mindset:</span>
 &quot;I worked really hard. I studied a lot and I paid attention to what I was doing / I watched a zillion tutorials and worked slowly and carefully / I trained hard and made sure I slept well / I did my research about how to speak to the execs / If I seek out more feedback I&apos;m sure I can do even better next time.&quot;</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Fixed Mindset:</span>
 &quot;I&apos;m good at this stuff. Math is easy for me / I&apos;m good with my hands / I&apos;m athletic / I&apos;m a good public speaker / I&apos;ve mastered this so I don&apos;t need to work on it anymore.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Observe how the growth mindset&apos;s explanations are choices. They are things you can <span class="CharOverride-2">do</span>
 . The fixed mindset, by contrast, is just stuff you <span class="CharOverride-2">are</span>
 . If you did well, it&apos;s because you <span class="CharOverride-2">are</span>
 good at it. If you did poorly, it&apos;s because you&apos;re bad at it.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Carol Dweck, who originated the term, discovered that people who have more of a growth mindset are more successful than those with less. And, fittingly, she discovered that people can develop a growth mindset.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-002-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00030.html#endnote-002">2</a>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A growth mindset is important for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">It encourages people to invest in the work that will make them succeed.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">It encourages intellectual humility and continuous learning.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Those with a fixed mindset (or, perhaps more accurately, who haven&apos;t <span class="CharOverride-2">developed their growth mindset yet</span>
 ) might avoid challenges or hard work. If getting a math problem wrong means you&apos;re bad at math, it&apos;s natural to prefer the easy problems that you won&apos;t get wrong.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">To improve your growth mindset, pay attention to situations that trigger your fixed mindset. You can reframe &quot;I can&apos;t do it&quot; to &quot;I can&apos;t do it… yet.&quot; You can talk back to the inner-voice that says you need to appear right at all costs.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Focus on this with your team, too. Develop their growth mindset by emphasizing and celebrating learning. It&apos;s okay to compliment someone&apos;s talents, but also praise their hard work and effort.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor529"></a>
 Put aside your <a id="_idIndexMarker442"></a>
 ego</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There&apos;s one surprising description that came up again and again in conversations about what makes a great PM: &quot;ego-less.&quot; It&apos;s surprising, because if you&apos;ve ever met a PM, we tend to have big egos. In a sense, you have to think a lot of yourself to feel like you have any place in leading a team. Plus, we get a fancy title and many of us enjoy getting credit for our accomplishments.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The thing is, a person&apos;s ego often gets in the way of great product management. If you hoard the praise for your work instead of redirecting it, you&apos;ve missed out on a key opportunity to motivate your teammates. If you think you&apos;re too good to waste your time wading through data or attending to the details of project management, your team will suffer. If you reject a good idea just because it&apos;s not <span class="CharOverride-2">your</span>
 idea, you&apos;ll get worse results. If you&apos;re too self-centered, you&apos;ll be deemed &quot;difficult to manage&quot; and it will hold you back.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Instead, you need to shine a light on the accomplishments of your teammates. Be willing to step in wherever needed to ship great products, even if that means tedious data parsing or filling in for a QA gap. Welcome feedback and even criticism. Own up to your mistakes.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">Pretend, for a moment, that you don&apos;t care about being right, having the best idea, or landing that killer promotion. Do what&apos;s best for your team. <span class="CharOverride-1">Put aside your ego</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-2">.</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Putting aside your ego doesn&apos;t mean you won&apos;t be recognized for the great work you do. In fact, when you&apos;re the person standing up and calling attention to the accomplishments of other people on your team, people will see you as a leader, because that&apos;s how leaders act. That said, you can (and should) let your manager know about the good work you&apos;re doing (see <a href="text00049.html#_idTextAnchor980">&quot;Make sure your manager knows how your work is going&quot; in Chapter 34</a>
 ) so that more invisible parts of your contribution are understood.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor530"></a>
 Intellectual <a id="_idIndexMarker443"></a>
 <a id="_idIndexMarker444"></a>
 humility</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There&apos;s an apparent paradox with the best PMs: they&apos;re incredibly smart, and yet they&apos;re always open to the idea that they might be wrong. This trait is called intellectual humility, and it&apos;s a key to great PMing.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A PM with excellent product sense might have the fully-formed, best idea 60% of the time, but if they&apos;re stubborn and arrogant, they&apos;ll miss better ideas or iterations 40% of the time. Along the way, they&apos;ve probably alienated their coworkers and stifled their creativity.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Another PM might start with the best idea much less often, but because they&apos;re less sure that they must be right, they question their ideas and solicit other good ideas from their teammates. They listen closely to feedback instead of reflexively defending their initial idea. By generating more ideas and feedback, they&apos;ll come up with much better results. As an added bonus, their teammates feel more engaged, which improves their future output.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-003-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00030.html#endnote-003">3</a>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">Intellectual humility is closely associated with a growth mindset; you believe there could always be more to learn, even when things are going well. Intellectual humility is not only good for your team, but also for you.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Ironically, the more you read and study about a subject, the harder it is to maintain intellectual humility. After taking a course that teaches you the &quot;best&quot; framework, it&apos;s tempting to believe that the answer that got you an A+ on the test <span class="CharOverride-2">must</span>
 be right in the real world. Those tests and frameworks (even the ones in this book) are, of course, oversimplified.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Luckily, a &quot;fake it till you make it&quot; approach can work with intellectual humility, as long as you can overcome the part of your ego that says, &quot;I need credit for all the good ideas.&quot; You can humor the people around you by entertaining the idea that you might be wrong, listening to their feedback, and exploring alternatives, even if you don&apos;t initially believe your idea has any room for improvement. It can help to know the people around you will think <span class="CharOverride-2">more</span>
 of you when you&apos;re not overly attached to your own ideas. Over time, the realities of running teams and shipping products will help make that humility more authentic.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor531"></a>
 Maturity</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Maturity is important in a leader; it helps people to see you as responsible and wise. Maturity builds trust and attracts respect.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">To lead a team effectively, you need to not just <span class="CharOverride-2">be</span>
 mature; you also need to <span class="CharOverride-2">demonstrate</span>
 maturity. Focus on these personal qualities:<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-004-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00030.html#endnote-004">4</a>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Respect for expertise</span>
 : Experience isn&apos;t everything, but you shouldn&apos;t act like you know it all after trying something once. Aim to build mastery and pay attention to how your skills grow with repetition.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Awareness of context (and when you might be missing context)</span>
 : Don&apos;t come charging into a new situation and assume you found the perfect solution that everyone else missed. Ask questions and show humility. Make sure you learn the goals and constraints.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Seeing the nuance</span>
 : Make sure you don’t overlook important complexity. While junior PMs might tackle problems with black and white answers, as you advance, most situations will have complex trade-offs.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Restraint</span>
 : Great leaders don&apos;t act impulsively. They&apos;ll let other people speak first and don&apos;t interrupt. Instead of jumping into action reactively, they&apos;ll let some things work themselves out. </li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Diplomacy</span>
 : You need to be able to get alignment and buy-in without causing tension. This is especially important when working with cross-functional stakeholders.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Judgment</span>
 : As Ashley Fidler says, &quot;Judgment is making an appropriate plan for the situation and developing a sense of what&apos;s going to work.&quot;</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Fostering a healthy</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-1"><a id="_idIndexMarker445"></a>
</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-1">culture</span>
 : As a leader, you take responsibility for how your actions affect other people. If you complain, gossip, or reinforce an &quot;us vs. them&quot; culture, you might be stirring up trouble.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Discretion</span>
 : The higher you advance in a company, the more sensitive information you have access to. Don&apos;t share sensitive information, and don&apos;t brag about knowing confidential information.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Socially appropriate behavior</span>
 : Pay attention to social norms. Don&apos;t be a jerk on company mailing lists or chat channels, even random or miscellaneous ones. Avoid heavy drinking at work events.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Controlling your emotions</span>
 : Crying, yelling, moping, or showing over-the-top enthusiastic happiness can cause people to unconsciously assume you&apos;re less competent than you are. This doesn&apos;t mean you can&apos;t show <span class="CharOverride-2">any</span>
 emotion though. It&apos;s okay to be sad, stressed, excited, or frustrated; you just want to seem balanced here.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Admit your mistakes.</span>
 The more power and influence you have, the more complex your choices are—and the more chances you have to be wrong. Have the courage to admit your mistakes. It makes you look stronger, not weaker.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Change your mind.</span>
 Digging in your heels and insisting that you&apos;re right doesn&apos;t help your team, your company, or yourself. It just makes you look childish. Change your mind with better information, and strike compromises when it&apos;s appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Be aware, also, that the <span class="CharOverride-2">perception</span>
 of maturity can be susceptible to bias. In tech companies where most engineers wear shorts and t-shirts, many young women feel the need to wear blazers to be taken seriously (something I&apos;ve heard from many female leaders and used to do myself); that sort of thing should not be necessary.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you&apos;re mentoring a PM, please avoid the vague feedback that they need to be more mature. Even if you have good intentions, it can feel biased and can make people feel unwelcome—like you&apos;re blaming them for being young (and, possibly, female). Plus, it&apos;s not actionable.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Instead, reflect on your impressions and get specific about the behaviors you saw and what qualities you&apos;d like to see. Make sure your feedback is fair and unbiased before you share it.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor532"></a>
 Equanimity</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Equanimity is keeping calm under pressure. When things go wrong, the PM needs to stay calm and think rationally.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I used to pride myself on working through my stress. As the work piled up, I&apos;d run from team to team making quick decisions and giving orders. Taking a break would have felt like giving in. Luckily, a coworker pulled me aside and kindly told me that the team could tell I was stressed, and I was making them miserable. <span class="CharOverride-2">That</span>
 was a wake-up call!</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Your mood contributes to the team&apos;s <a id="_idIndexMarker446"></a>
 morale. Try to notice when you&apos;re stressed, and take a break. In the long term, sleeping well, eating well, exercising, and practicing mindful meditation can all help.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When you stay calm, it makes you look like a confident and competent leader. It signals to people that you&apos;ve got everything under control and are ready for the next challenge, which helps them focus on their own work.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor533" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Growth Practices</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor534"></a>
 <a id="_idTextAnchor535"></a>
 Don&apos;t let <a id="_idIndexMarker447"></a>
 Impostor Syndrome hold you back</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Impostor syndrome is that voice in your head that tells you, &quot;I don&apos;t deserve to be where I am. I got lucky and, sooner or later, people are going to realize that I&apos;m unqualified.&quot; Not everyone hears this voice, but it is very, very common, even among the most successful people.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The most important tip for dealing with impostor syndrome is to understand that it is common and realize that just because you <span class="CharOverride-2">feel</span>
 like an impostor, doesn&apos;t mean you <span class="CharOverride-2">are</span>
 one. Beyond that, working with a trusted mentor can help.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Be careful not to let impostor syndrome hold you back. Watch situations like these:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Not asking important questions for fear of looking stupid.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Not applying for promotions or roles that you&apos;re ready for.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Declining an invitation to speak at a conference because you&apos;re not sure you have enough to say of value, particularly in comparison to the other &quot;more impressive&quot; speakers.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Getting sleep deprived due to excessive work hours spent trying to get things perfect.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you&apos;re mentoring someone with impostor syndrome, check out <a href="text00036.html#_idTextAnchor666">&quot;Mentoring someone with impostor syndrome&quot; in Chapter 25</a>
 for advice on how to overcome it.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor536"></a>
 Build Internal Strength and Confidence <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In some jobs, there is a &quot;right answer.&quot; The code works, the patient is cured, the students learn, and so on. You do your job well and everyone around you is happy. It&apos;s very satisfying.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">With product management, especially as you take on more complex and ambiguous work, there&apos;s no clear right answer. You&apos;ll make tough decisions with lots of tradeoffs and risk assessments, and you might never learn whether the opposite choice would have been better. Often, someone will be unhappy with your choice. As you advance, you&apos;ll hear more complaints and less praise, even if you&apos;re great at your work.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-005-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00030.html#endnote-005">5</a>
</span>
</span>
 When things go badly, you take the blame; when things go well, you pass all the credit along to your team. That&apos;s the nature of the job.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">On top of all of that, as you advance, you&apos;ll have more responsibilities to handle with less free time. You&apos;ll need to get comfortable with doing the quick-and-dirty approach (aka rapid prototyping) for most things, even when you know you could have put together something better with more time.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The best advice on this is to realize that ambiguity is a natural part of the job. When you see situations where you can&apos;t make everyone happy or polish things to perfection, reframe it as a sign that you&apos;re working on difficult and important problems.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor537" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Concepts and Frameworks</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor538"></a>
 The <a id="_idIndexMarker448"></a>
 Drama Triangle and Shifting Above the Line</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The Conscious Leadership Group has books, videos, and live training that are closely related to building a growth mindset. They use a metaphor of a line to describe the difference between being below the line (closed, defensive, and committed to being right) and above the line (open, curious, and committed to learning).<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-006-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00030.html#endnote-006">6</a>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When you&apos;re angry with a coworker for messing something up, forcing you to rush in to save the day, you&apos;re looking at things from a below-the-line perspective. It&apos;s natural to then enter into the &quot;drama triangle,&quot; where we tell ourselves a story where each person plays the role of hero, victim, or villain. In this mindset we&apos;re fixated on assigning blame or being right. It&apos;s not necessarily a bad thing to spend some time in this mindset; it&apos;s just not a useful place to solve problems or make progress.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">It&apos;s okay to spend some time below the line. We need to work through our own feelings, too. In fact, even exaggerating the goodness or badness of the players of the drama triangle can be helpful. It can help us to vent, as well as to identify the patterns of the drama triangle.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">But, when you&apos;re ready to solve problems, it helps to shift above the line.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-007-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00030.html#endnote-007">7</a>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Once you&apos;re above the line, you can reflect on the original conflict. You might ask yourself, &quot;In what ways should they have acted the way they did?&quot; Or, &quot;In what ways should I have done something different?&quot; This will help you learn from your experiences and find good solutions.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor539" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Key Takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Your mood and mindset affect your team</span>
 : When you&apos;re stressed, your team notices. When you fixate on who&apos;s right or wrong, it&apos;s harder to solve problems. If you doubt yourself, you might not ask the important questions. If you&apos;re overly-confident in your knowledge, you might not learn new information. Invest in yourself.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1"><a id="_idIndexMarker449"></a>
 <span class="CharOverride-1">Maturity is mostly about slowing down, paying attention, and respecting other people</span>
 : While accusations of immaturity often carry some bias, maturity is a real leadership skill that doesn&apos;t just mean &quot;grow older.&quot; Ask a trusted mentor for honest feedback.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Everyone has doubts sometimes</span>
 : PMs are responsible for the toughest decisions that have no right answers. There&apos;s often no way to know you made the right choice, and you won&apos;t get much praise for your work. That doesn&apos;t mean you&apos;re making a mistake or are unqualified, it just means the work is hard. The more senior you get, the more of these hard problems you&apos;ll face; think of it as a sign that you&apos;re advancing!</li>
