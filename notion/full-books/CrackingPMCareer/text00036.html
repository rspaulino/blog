<span class="AllCaps-Bold _idGenCharOverride-1">Congrats! You land</span>
 your dream job as a PM Lead at <span class="CharOverride-1">Shoeless Socks</span>
 , a personalized sock subscription service. You walk into your first day excited to revolutionize the exciting world of sock delivery!</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Your CEO pulls you aside and informs you that, due to some mix of circumstances around people traveling, a lack of experienced PMs, and an odd company culture, there&apos;s no one around to guide you. &quot;No worries,&quot; she says. &quot;You can figure it out.&quot;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Suddenly, the winding road ahead has grown spikes and roadblocks.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">On Day 1, instead of an hour discussion about the team&apos;s priorities, you spent four hours trying to find the team&apos;s strategy documents. On Day 2, you prioritized the incoming bugs—only to learn that you were working off of an outdated list. It feels like your days and weeks are spent doing things wrong, or reinventing the wheel, or just trying to figure out <span class="CharOverride-1">how</span>
 to do something.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">By the end of your first month, you are exhausted and frustrated from all the senseless mistakes and inefficiencies. It didn&apos;t have to be this way!</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">By the end of your first year, you have likely quit—or, perhaps, changed things around so that this doesn&apos;t happen to the next PM.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Even for experienced PMs, a small amount of onboarding can be a huge multiplier on their productivity. Being able to ask a few questions saves hours of time. Regular feedback keeps them on the right path. If the mentor is particularly good, the mentee&apos;s trajectory can be transformed by being focused on the most important areas to develop.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis"><a id="_idIndexMarker500"></a>
 Mentoring takes time, but is incredibly impactful. Improving the quality and effectiveness of other PMs is one of the strongest ways to contribute to your company&apos;s overall success. When you become a mentor, you expand your influence beyond the teams you directly PM, to all of the teams that your mentees lead as well.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">While mentoring is an important skill for all PMs, it&apos;s especially important for people managers and those who would like to become managers. Mentoring an intern or an APM is a great stepping stone to a management role. Sure, the intern is effectively a guinea pig for the employee&apos;s management skills. But the intern gets a dedicated resource, there to offer guidance and advice. And the mentor gets to learn a key aspect of management, without undue responsibility for someone&apos;s long-term career. It&apos;s a win-win.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor643"></a>
 Finding people to mentor</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The easiest way to start mentoring is to volunteer. You can let your manager know you&apos;d love to onboard a new hire or mentor a summer intern.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If that doesn&apos;t work, you can find your own mentees. Keep an eye out for people who are asking for help and offer to answer any questions they have. You don&apos;t need to limit yourself to PMs. If your teammates are interested in learning more about product management, you can let them <a id="_idIndexMarker501"></a>
 shadow you on PM work.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">See <a href="text00042.html#_idTextAnchor755">Chapter 29: Coaching and Development</a>

 Responsibilities</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor645"></a>
 <a id="_idTextAnchor646"></a>
 Teach your mentee about the company and product</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When you mentor someone on your team, you want to make sure they learn the information that will help them succeed.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If possible, write up an onboarding document. You can link to material to read or watch, so you can make better use of your face-to-face time.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here are some things to cover when you mentor someone who&apos;s new to your team:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Company and team purpose</span>
 : Make sure they know the mission, vision, and goals. Let them know the top priorities so they&apos;ll have the context they need.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Customer insights</span>
 : What are the fundamental insights they should know to start? Did anything surprise you back when you were new? Anything that might embarrass them to get wrong?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Product</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-2"><a id="_idIndexMarker502"></a>
</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-2">demo</span>
 : Even if your mentee used the product before they joined the company, chances are they are only familiar with a fraction of its functionality. As you show them the product, talk about the product-related decisions that were made and why.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Marketing/competitive landscape</span>
 : What should they know about the target audience or key competitors? How is the product positioned? What do you admire about different competitors or what worries you? What are the hot markets that the company is trying to expand into?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Tools and communication channels</span>
 : What dashboards and tools do people at the company use? What software do you have installed? Are there webpages you&apos;ve bookmarked? What mailing lists, groups, or chat channels are you on?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Processes and</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-2"><a id="_idIndexMarker503"></a>
</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-2">workarounds</span>
 : What processes does the team follow? Are there templates or training? Are there steps that can be skipped or any workarounds that people commonly use? Are there unspoken rules?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">The scoop on key people</span>
 : Which people are important to know? How do you get on their good sides and avoid their bad sides? Is there anything special to know about working with them, such as the best way to reach out to them? Which people are regarded as the best mentors and managers?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Any traps or pitfalls</span>
 : Is there anything that tends to trip people up? Any mistakes that they should avoid? Anything you personally got caught by that you can warn your mentee about?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">The fun stuff</span>
 : Share the things that make work enjoyable. Is there a secret stash of chocolate in one of the rooms? A quiet place to work with a great view? A chat channel where people share funny memes?</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Beyond the information that people need when they&apos;re new, you&apos;ll also want to continually share context with your mentee. Mentees appreciate when you share the highlights of strategic or higher-level meetings.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor647"></a>
 Mentor through apprenticeship</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As important as sharing knowledge is, the best way to mentor someone is through on-the-job <a id="_idIndexMarker504"></a>
 training. A huge part of being a PM is handling the unexpected, so you need to get into the real work to see how it&apos;s done.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here are some techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1"><a id="_idIndexMarker505"></a>
 <span class="CharOverride-2">Shadowing</span>
 : Invite them to watch you work in a variety of circumstances. They can join your meetings. They can sit next to you while you process your inbox. They can watch as you go over new prototypes with your designer. You can call them over to show them how you use data tools. If their desk can be put next to yours, there will be many opportunities for serendipitous shadowing.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Pairing on your work</span>
 : Include them in your active work. Talk through your decisions and ask them for their thoughts. Whiteboard together. Let them take the lead on some parts and redirect them as necessary. This is especially powerful when you include them on work that&apos;s more advanced or strategic than what they&apos;d normally be responsible for; it will demystify what the next level looks like.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Pairing on their work</span>
 : Help them think through their decisions. Review their writing before it&apos;s shared more broadly. Let them rehearse presentations in front of you.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Reverse shadowing</span>
 : Watch them in meetings or presentations and take notes to share with them later. Point out the things they did well, anything they need to improve on, and what the next level would look like.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Be available</span>
 : A key differentiator between successful and unsuccessful mentors is how available they make themselves to their mentees. Schedule regular <a id="_idIndexMarker506"></a>
 1:1s so they can ask you any questions that are on their mind. If they don&apos;t ask you a lot of questions, check in with them proactively and reassure them that they&apos;re never bothering you with their questions.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">On-the-job training like this is so valuable because you&apos;ve developed expertise and approaches that aren&apos;t always easy to articulate. They can absorb this by watching you.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor648"></a>
 Give your mentee feedback to help them grow <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As a mentor, you have a unique perspective on your mentee&apos;s strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Set up a cadence to give feedback and coaching regularly. For very junior PMs, you might want to debrief with them after each of their important meetings. As they get more senior, you might want to set aside a portion of each 1:1 or every fourth 1:1 to discuss their growth opportunities, not just tactical matters. Starting this habit early makes it easier if you ever have to share negative feedback.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As you think about which feedback to share and emphasize, focus on the top priorities that will help them grow and get to the next level. Make sure they have a clear and inspiring view of what growth looks like.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Your instinct might be to tell a mentee to just keep up the good work. But, if someone is meeting and exceeding expectations at their current level, it&apos;s time to start coaching them for a promotion. Reinforce that they&apos;re doing great, but also share the feedback you&apos;d have for them if they were a level higher. Not only does this help them grow faster, it prevents them from feeling like it&apos;s unfair that they weren&apos;t promoted yet.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor649"></a>
 Gather peer feedback for your mentee <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Peer feedback helps both the mentor and mentee see multiple perspectives. Feedback is more powerful and more difficult to dismiss if you hear it from multiple people.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Many companies have official peer review cycles, but they might not be frequent enough for what your mentee needs. You can gather peer feedback unofficially, such as by meeting occasionally with their main partners, or asking for written feedback.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Be aware that many people don&apos;t like to write anything negative, so you&apos;ll sometimes miss problems if you&apos;re not careful. It can help to include an explicit multiple choice question such as &quot;Are they on track to succeed? Yes, Yes with caveats, or No?&quot; It can also help to let them answer anonymously, or to meet with them in person so you can read their body language.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There are a few ways to share the peer feedback with your mentee. You can share it directly. You can pick out key quotes (while being sure to respect the anonymity expectations you set up). You&apos;ll also want to share your interpretation of the feedback (perhaps after letting them self-identify the themes) so they don&apos;t focus on the wrong things.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor650"></a>
 Be a <a id="_idIndexMarker507"></a>
 sponsor, not just a mentor <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">To have a significant impact on someone&apos;s career, you need to do more than just advise them. You need to use your influence to help them get the recognition and opportunities they deserve.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Help your mentees get visibility for their good work. Share their accomplishments with company leaders. Celebrate their successes publicly and let everyone know about their contributions. Consider sending a note to their manager praising the things they&apos;ve done especially well.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Find good career opportunities for your mentee. You can pass along invitations to speak at conferences. Recommend your mentees for important projects. Lend your credibility to your mentees.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As a people manager, sponsorship is even more important. It can look like hiring someone you believe in, promoting them, assigning them to important projects, putting them on stage at a conference, or giving them other career opportunities. Great sponsorship as a manager is often about recognizing that someone is ready for a big opportunity before they do, and encouraging them to take it.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor651" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Growth Practices</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor652"></a>
 <a id="_idTextAnchor653"></a>
 Get comfortable giving easy developmental feedback</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Make sure you&apos;re sharing the following types of feedback on a regular basis.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor654"></a>
 Positive feedback</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Positive feedback is fun to share and helps in multiple ways:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Improves confidence</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Helps people feel appreciated</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Gives them more insight on what areas of their work was valuable and why</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">&quot;Catch them behaving&quot; reinforces the behaviors you want to see more of</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Strengthens the relationships so it will be easier to point out problems when you need to</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Some PMs will claim that they just like to hear constructive feedback and don&apos;t care about positive feedback. In practice though, they&apos;ll start to get demoralized or disconnected from you if you give mostly constructive feedback. Aim to give much more positive feedback than constructive feedback.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The more specific you can be with your positive feedback, the better the person will absorb it:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Basic</span>
 : &quot;Great job with the launch!&quot;</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Intermediate</span>
 : &quot;Great work catching that problem with your thorough testing!&quot;</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Advanced</span>
 : &quot;Great work catching that problem with your thorough testing! Those test scripts you put together are a great example of good execution. Our customer support team is really going to appreciate that you saved them all of those tickets.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor655"></a>
 Small corrections</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Small corrections are the &quot;learning on the job&quot; type of feedback that&apos;s expected whenever someone is trying something new or taking on a <a id="_idIndexMarker508"></a>
 stretch project. For example, maybe they sent out a status update that was too long and difficult to read. Maybe they answered an executive&apos;s question in a confusing way.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">To make the most of small corrections:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Give small corrections in the moment (or as soon afterwards as you can share it privately).</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">If your mentee likes to get a lot of feedback, try sharing &quot;Five things you did well and two things you could have done better&quot; on a regular basis.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Ask &quot;How do you think that went?&quot; to open up the conversation. It gives them a chance to reflect and start to notice problems on their own, which is the first step to fixing them.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">If your mentee feels it went great but you noticed problems, you can point them out gently: &quot;Did you notice that the salesperson seemed frustrated? What do you think she was getting at with those questions?&quot;</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">When possible, point your mentee to examples of the skill done well.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Be careful not to overwhelm or distract them with small corrections when there&apos;s something more important they should be focusing on.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Remember that having a positive relationship with your mentee will make offering corrections like this much easier.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor656"></a>
 &quot;Next level&quot; feedback</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">&quot;Keep doing what you&apos;re doing&quot; is a dissatisfying answer for an overachiever.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Even when someone is on a good track and just needs more time to see their work through to get to the next promotion, there&apos;s still something they could be doing even better.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Instead, imagine they&apos;ve been promoted to a higher level and the expectations are even higher. What would that look like? What feedback would you have for them at that point? It might be that they could do the same quality of work faster, or be able to anticipate problems sooner, or set a more ambitious goal.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Make sure your tone sounds inspiring and sends the message that they&apos;re doing well. &quot;That presentation was great; you&apos;ve got really strong communication skills for an APM! If you want to think about what the next level looks like, see if you could tighten it up to deliver the same amount of signal in half the time.&quot;</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor657"></a>
 Giving negative feedback <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Sometimes, you&apos;ll notice performance issues that go beyond simply &quot;learning on the job&quot; and need to be corrected. Your goal is to give the information they need while preserving the relationship, and then to maximize the chance that they follow through and improve.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Depending on the severity of the issue, how early you caught it, and how strong your relationship is with the person, there are a few levels of formality you can use. For any serious issues, make sure to work with your manager first.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor658"></a>
 Don&apos;t use a feedback sandwich</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You might have heard the advice to deliver criticism via a &quot;feedback sandwich&quot;: first something positive, then the criticism, then another positive.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-001-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00036.html#endnote-001">1</a>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">At first glance, it seems useful; in practice it tends to be damaging. This doesn&apos;t mean something along those lines can&apos;t ever be helpful; just that, more often than not, it backfires to wrap up criticism with some cheap compliments.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-002-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00036.html#endnote-002">2</a>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Consider this bit of feedback:</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">Hey Brian, about that presentation. I loved the funny story you told at the beginning. It didn&apos;t seem like you were very prepared though: you hadn&apos;t pulled the usage data or looked at the error rate and that made it difficult to make a decision. We came to a good decision at the end, though. Thanks for running the meeting!</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">What is Brian supposed to take away from that? You&apos;d like him to hear, &quot;Hey, please be more prepared.&quot; But in practice, one of two things might happen:</p>
<ol>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-2" value="1">He actually hears the criticism (great!), but he&apos;s ignored the positive stuff; the compliment was only given to facilitate criticism. So your positivity accomplished very little, other than making you seem sort of fake.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-2" value="2">The positive stuff drowns out the negative feedback. He doesn&apos;t realize that this was actually important feedback, as people often overemphasize the first and last things they hear in a conversation.</li>
</ol>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you employ the feedback sandwich frequently, Brian <span class="CharOverride-1">will</span>
 indeed learn from it—but not what you want him to learn. He&apos;ll learn that your compliments are a mere gateway to criticism. Next time you give him a compliment, he&apos;ll be bracing himself for what he did wrong.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There are better approaches.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor659"></a>
 Handling a first offense</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The first time you notice a problem, you can take a lightweight approach:</p>
<ol>
<li class="Numbers-Left ParaOverride-3" value="1">Point out the problem factually.</li>
<li class="Numbers-Left" value="2">Ask them about it, giving them the benefit of the doubt.</li>
<li class="Numbers-Left" value="3">Reinforce that it&apos;s important.</li>
<li class="Numbers-Left" value="4">Make sure they come up with a plan to address the problem.</li>
</ol>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here&apos;s an example of what that might look like.</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Mentor</span>
 : Hey Brian, I noticed you hadn&apos;t prepared the usage data or looked at the error rate before the meeting today. What&apos;s up with that?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Occasionally they&apos;ll give a great answer where they take responsibility on their own:</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Brian</span>
 : Oh yeah, I feel awful about that. I&apos;d meant to do it this morning but we found a P0 bug in production and I spent the whole morning helping the engineers fix it. I&apos;ll make sure not to save that until the last minute next time.</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Mentor</span>
 : Awesome, it&apos;s important to be prepared for those meetings. Thanks for being on top of it!</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">More typically, they&apos;ll need a bit of support to come up with a plan:</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Brian</span>
 : Oh yeah. I&apos;d meant to do it this morning but we found a P0 bug in production and I spent the whole morning helping the engineers fix it.</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Mentor</span>
 : Ah, that happens sometimes. But it is really important to be prepared for executive meetings so we don&apos;t waste their time and damage our credibility. What are your thoughts on how to make sure it doesn&apos;t happen again?</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Brian</span>
 : Oh! I hadn&apos;t realized it was a big deal. I guess I can postpone the meeting if a last-minute emergency comes up.</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Mentor</span>
 : Postponing could delay your whole schedule. What about preparing the data a few days in advance?</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Brian</span>
 : That&apos;s a good idea, I&apos;ll do that, thanks!</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor660"></a>
 Addressing a pattern</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If the problem becomes a pattern that&apos;s affecting their performance, you may want to take a more formal approach. As with all negative feedback, make sure you deliver it in private.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here&apos;s an example of a formal approach:</p>
<ol>
<li class="Numbers-Left ParaOverride-3" value="1">Ask if you can give them some feedback</li>
<li class="Numbers-Left" value="2">Describe the issue and share two examples. Keep it factual, and explain the implications of the issue.</li>
<li class="Numbers-Left" value="3">Reinforce your positive intention for giving the feedback</li>
<li class="Numbers-Left" value="4">Invite them to share what they think</li>
<li class="Numbers-Left" value="5">Come up with a solution and plan to follow up</li>
</ol>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here&apos;s an example of what that might look like.</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Mentor</span>
 : Hi Brian, I wanted to give you some feedback. Is now a good time?</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Brian</span>
 : Sure.</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Mentor</span>
 : I&apos;ve noticed a problem where you&apos;re not prepared for meetings. Two weeks ago, you didn&apos;t have the usage data at the executive presentation, and yesterday there was no agenda for the cross-functional partners meeting. When you&apos;re not prepared, it wastes people&apos;s time and shows a gap in execution skills. I&apos;m sharing this because I believe in you and want you to succeed. What do you think?</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Brian</span>
 : I thought I didn&apos;t need an agenda since it was the second partners meeting.</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Mentor</span>
 : Sending an agenda is important so that you can make sure the right people attend, and to make sure the meeting is a good use of everyone&apos;s time. We ran out of time on the sales update and didn&apos;t get a chance to discuss partnerships, which means you needed a follow-up meeting which could have been avoided.</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Brian</span>
 : That makes sense</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Mentor</span>
 : Alright, let&apos;s come up with a game plan for moving forward. What do you think would work?</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Brian</span>
 : Maybe I could check in with you before my meetings to make sure I&apos;ve done enough preparation?</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Mentor</span>
 : That works for me. When&apos;s your next meeting?</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Brian</span>
 : Friday</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Mentor</span>
 : Okay, we can review your preparation at our <a id="_idIndexMarker509"></a>

 Get feedback on your <a id="_idIndexMarker510"></a>
 mentoring</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Getting feedback on your mentoring is important for two reasons. First, it gives you the information you need to improve. Second, it helps you get recognition for the good mentoring you&apos;ve done.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Mentorship happens in private, and so it&apos;s usually invisible to your manager and the promotion committee unless you work to make it visible. If you catch problems before they happen, your manager might not realize you did anything.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Talk to your manager about the challenges your mentee is facing and ask for feedback on how you&apos;ve approached them. Get written feedback from your mentees that you can use in the performance review cycle. Most mentees are reluctant to share critical feedback, so you might need your manager to collect anonymous feedback to get the full picture.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor662"></a>
 Guide your mentees to figure out solutions on their own <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As a mentor, you should help your mentees figure out solutions on their own, rather than just giving advice or telling them what to do. Ask questions instead of giving the answer.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Your role is to help your mentee become independent. They need to learn how to build up their own mental models and frameworks, as well as break away from the school-mindset that there&apos;s a single right answer. They need to learn how to solve problems on their own.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You might find it difficult not to blurt out the &quot;right&quot; answer when someone comes and asks for advice. Here are some tips.</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Practice asking &quot;what have you tried?&quot;, &quot;what are you leaning towards?&quot; or &quot;What do you think we should do?&quot; before sharing any of your own thoughts.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Loosen your belief that you know the only right answer. Try to foster a mindset of curiosity.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Ask broad, open-ended questions that illuminate your thought process like &quot;What factors are you considering for prioritization?&quot;, &quot;What are the tradeoffs?&quot;, &quot;What has worked for you before?&quot;, &quot;Where could you find that data?&quot; or &quot;How do you think they would react to that?&quot;</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Silence is your friend. Let them have as long as they need to answer.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Stay one level more abstract than the solution you have in mind. For example, ask &quot;Is there a way you could make the information more easily digestible?&quot;, instead of &quot;Should you add a graph?&quot;</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">If you really want to jump in with advice, first ask &quot;Would you like to hear what I would do in that situation?&quot; Give them autonomy over whether to take the advice, or not.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It&apos;s normal that you&apos;ll sometimes slip up and jump right into giving advice. Pay attention to those times and reflect on what happened, and over time you&apos;ll find it becomes easier.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor663"></a>
 Refine the way you give developmental feedback <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When you give someone developmental feedback, you help cut through the noise and show them what to focus on. You give them an outside perspective to shine a spotlight on what they&apos;re doing well and what needs improvement.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here are some practices to improve how you give developmental feedback.</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Get into the mindset that you&apos;re on their side</span>
 . If they don&apos;t believe that you&apos;re on their side, they&apos;ll reject your feedback. Make sure you&apos;re not giving feedback to criticize or complain; you&apos;re giving it because you want to see them succeed.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Give feedback privately</span>
 . This should be obvious, but don&apos;t give someone feedback in front of other people.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Be explicit about the message they should take away from your feedback.</span>
 Americans, for example, tend to downplay feedback when they have to deliver negative comments (leading American listeners to subconsciously &quot;play up&quot; negative feedback). This sort of adjustment—or lack thereof—can lead people to wildly misinterpret the message in either direction. Tell them if they should feel good about the feedback or if it&apos;s a serious issue.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Speak objectively</span>
 . Rather than using judgements and opinions, share the facts you saw and the feelings you had. You can use &quot;The story I&apos;m telling myself…&quot; to introduce assumptions or guesses. This helps defuse defensiveness.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Be specific and share the implication</span>
 . For both positive and negative feedback, it helps to give specific examples and explain why those examples are good or bad. Reinforce the outcomes that happened because of their behavior.</li>
</ul>

 Concepts and Frameworks</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idIndexMarker511"></a>
 <a id="_idTextAnchor665"></a>
 Reviewing and <a id="_idIndexMarker512"></a>
 critiquing work</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Despite how much &quot;critique&quot; sounds like &quot;criticism,&quot; you&apos;re not supposed to simply point out everything you don&apos;t like. A critique is about analyzing the work and assessing how well it achieves its goals. The term is often used for giving feedback on designs, but the concept also applies to reviewing specs, presentations, or any other work someone produces.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">One of the best ways to mentor is through the feedback you give people on their work. By explaining the reasoning behind your feedback, you can help your mentees build their mental models and frameworks.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here are some ways to give feedback on work to the people you mentor:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Double check their goals</span>
 . A critique needs to assess the work against the goals, so you want to make sure you&apos;re on the same page. Even if the goals seem obvious, the act of asking reinforces that the person is expected to be intentional.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Use &quot;I like&quot;, &quot;I wish&quot;, and &quot;I wonder.&quot;</span>
 Using this framing helps you share your feedback without making people feel defensive. For example, &quot;I wonder if this will be discoverable enough for our goals with just an icon.&quot;</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Include positive reinforcement</span>
 . Let them know which parts are working well, and praise the places they&apos;ve done something especially good.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Make it a teaching moment</span>
 . Share stories or context that will help the person absorb the lesson better. Explain your framework and reasoning. Allow space for discussion if they disagree or have questions.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Point out where they could do less</span>
 . Critique can have the unintended side effect of pushing people to pursue perfection. It&apos;s just as important to point out where they could have moved faster by cutting corners or calling it good enough.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Give them space to make their own mistakes</span>
 . When possible, give them space to make their own decisions and learn on their own. Instead of pressuring them into your solution, suggest checkpoints and ways for them to validate if their idea will work.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Pay attention to patterns of mistakes</span>
 . The patterns of mistakes can show you where you need to invest in more training or guidance.</li>

 Mentoring someone with <a id="_idIndexMarker514"></a>
 impostor syndrome</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Impostor syndrome (see <a href="text00030.html#_idTextAnchor534">&quot;Don&apos;t let Impostor Syndrome hold you back&quot; in Chapter 19</a>
 ) is when someone thinks they got their success by luck or accident, and are afraid of being exposed as a fraud. Mentors play an important role here since people might not notice it for themselves.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-004-backlink">

</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You might suspect that a mentee has impostor syndrome if they don&apos;t seem confident, they downplay their good work, seem reluctant to take on opportunities that you feel they&apos;re capable of, or spend too long perfecting work that is already good enough.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here are some tips that may help:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Introduce them to the concept of impostor syndrome and let them know that many—probably most—successful people have felt it. Just having a label for this can help someone understand that &quot;I feel unqualified&quot; isn&apos;t necessarily indicative of &quot;I am unqualified.&quot;</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Help them see their strengths and the good work they&apos;ve done. Point out the choices they made that not every PM would have made. Solicit peer feedback so they can hear directly from their coworkers what they&apos;re doing well.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Set honest expectations. Give them context on what kinds of mistakes are normal and what information you expect them to learn, rather than already know.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Shine a light on the ways their lack of confidence is holding them back. Point out when they undersell the research they did or waste time over-preparing.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Help them find ways to quickly validate or invalidate their fears, such as sharing early drafts of their work with a trusted mentor.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Model a willingness to admit what you don&apos;t know. Ensure that your work culture makes it safe to ask questions and learn. See <a href="text00031.html#_idTextAnchor545">&quot;Create Psychological Safety&quot; in Chapter 20</a>
</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Be open with them about where their <span class="CharOverride-1">actual</span>
 growth opportunities are.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Remember that impostor syndrome is extremely common, at all levels of experience.</p>

 Key Takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Great mentors provide information, apprenticeship, and feedback</span>
 : Some things people learn best by being told, some they learn best by watching, some by doing, and some by hearing how they did. Don&apos;t limit yourself to just one or two of these techniques.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">If you&apos;re uncomfortable providing feedback, plan ahead</span>
 : There are lots of handy phrases, templates, and approaches that make it easier to share feedback. Set up a plan for how you&apos;ll give feedback early in the relationship, so you&apos;re ready when you have tough feedback to share.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">To develop their skills, help your mentee figure out solutions on their own</span>
 : To become independent, PMs need to learn how to find their own solutions. Instead of always rushing in with your advice, hold space for your mentee to think through their options.</li>
