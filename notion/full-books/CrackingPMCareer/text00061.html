<span class="AllCaps-Bold _idGenCharOverride-1" style=";color:black;">Sachin Rekhi</span>
 is the CEO and founder of Notejoy, a collaborative notes app for you and your team. Prior to Notejoy, Sachin founded Connected (a personal relationship manager) and Anywhere.FM (a web music player later acquired by imeem). He&apos;s been an entrepreneur-in-residence at Trinity Ventures and head of Sales Solution Products at LinkedIn. Sachin held marketing, product management, and engineering roles at Microsoft, Paetec Communications, and Goldman Sachs.</p>

</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1125" style=";color:black;"></a>
 How did you get into product management?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I studied computer science at the University of Pennsylvania and got a business degree from Wharton. My initial plan was to spend a few years doing software engineering and then move into the world of entrepreneurship.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Talking to a recruiter at Microsoft was the first time I heard about the product management role. I realized the part I love most about software is building solutions to solve people&apos;s real world problems. So, I ended up deciding to do a PM internship at Microsoft and then joined Microsoft full time as a PM.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1126" style=";color:black;"></a>
 How did you go from Microsoft into entrepreneurship?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I always saw Microsoft as a place where I&apos;d learn how software was developed in the real world so I&apos;d be better prepared to go start my own company. If you go straight to a career in entrepreneurship, you spin your wheels on what you should do. I saw that at imeem—they didn&apos;t have any bug prioritization process and just had an email address to collect bugs. I always advise people who want to be entrepreneurs to spend two years at an established tech company first.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">While I was at Microsoft, I used to riff on startup ideas with a group of friends. One of my buddies came to me one day and said we should go start a company. I&apos;d just gotten promoted and didn&apos;t want to leave, but he told me he was going to start something with or without me. I knew finding the right cofounders was the most important part of starting a company so I made the hard call and decided to leave Microsoft.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">We had no idea what startup we were going to start at the time. Along with a third friend from Amazon, we sat in a room and just started coming up with ideas. We presented our top idea to Paul Graham at Y Combinator. He thought it was a terrible idea but liked us as a team, so he gave us two weeks to come up with a new idea.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">At the time—this was in 2006, before Rdio and Spotify—we noticed that when you&apos;re in the office and wanted to listen to music, you had two options. One was putting in earphones on an iPod, even though you&apos;re sitting in front of this big monitor. Or, you could use a service like Pandora, which wasn&apos;t your own music. Our thought was, what if you took your entire music collection from your computer, uploaded it to the web, and then played it through this robust internet web music player. That was the idea behind Anywhere.FM.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">We ultimately sold Anywhere.FM to imeem, another music company.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1127" style=";color:black;"></a>
 What was it like at imeem?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When I got there, I realized that while they had deals with all four major labels, the biggest challenge was that they were prohibitively expensive. We were losing way more money than we were making. I realized the company was dead unless we figured out <a id="_idIndexMarker890"></a>
 monetization. Even though they&apos;d hired us to be feature PMs and UI PMs, I told them I really wanted to solve the monetization problem because otherwise we&apos;d be dead in the water.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">What we ended up doing was building a completely new audio ad format. This was before Spotify, when everyone was just doing banner ads. We made an audio ad unit with an eight second audio ad on top of a banner ad. It was a new product innovation. And then we got the complete runaround when we were going to sell it.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">We went to all the classic marketing ad agencies, but the digital division told us to talk to the radio division and the radio division told us to talk to the digital division. We didn&apos;t know how to sell it. We ultimately figured out we could rebrand it as a rich media banner so we could sell it to the digital division. I eventually built it up to a multi million revenue line. Unfortunately, it was too little on the monetization side too late. Ultimately, imeem did sell to MySpace music, but it wasn&apos;t a big exit.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1128" style=";color:black;"></a>
 What led you to Trinity Ventures?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I knew I wanted to start another company, but I wanted to be a lot more thoughtful this time around. One of the venture capitalists at Trinity Ventures suggested I join them and think of my startup idea as an entrepreneur in residence.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">At Trinity Ventures, I came up with a framework which I describe as the eight hypotheses of product market fit.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-001-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00061.html#endnote-001">1</a>
</span>
</span>
 This was the lens I used to figure out for each idea I came up with whether it was worth pursuing.</p>
<ol>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1" value="1">Who&apos;s the target customer you&apos;re going after?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1" value="2">What is the problem you&apos;re solving?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1" value="3">What is your core value proposition?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1" value="4">What&apos;s your strategic differentiation?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1" value="5">Who is your competition?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1" value="6">What&apos;s your go-to-market strategy of how you&apos;re going to attract customers?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1" value="7">How are you going to <a id="_idIndexMarker891"></a>
 monetize?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1" value="8">What are your <a id="_idIndexMarker892"></a>
 North Star metrics?</li>
</ol>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I&apos;d write these up in 1-2 pages for each startup idea.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">That framework was really important and ultimately kept with me, even for building a feature inside a larger company. It helps a PM to be far more strategic upfront.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I went through that process, and then came up with the idea for Connected. The interesting insight from Connected was that it combined my obsession with productivity tools with what I learned from working with salespeople at imeem. I noticed that the salespeople who were closing all our big deals were innately relationship-oriented. When we visited New York, they&apos;d scroll through their iPhone and invite people to catch up and grab a drink. That catch-up would turn into a business meeting and then into a sale.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Our idea was a contact management tool that would not only keep your contacts up-to-date, it would help you build better rapport and maintain those relationships.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1129" style=";color:black;"></a>
 How did you end up at LinkedIn?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">After launching and running Connected for about a year and a half, LinkedIn reached out to us for an acquisition. They told us initially that they&apos;d treat us as a startup and leave us alone, but it turned out that couldn&apos;t have been further from the truth. LinkedIn was only 1800 people, but it operated much more like Microsoft than it did a startup.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">My cofounder Ada and I transitioned our style to being much more like Microsoft. Influencing without authority was really important. Executive management was really important. Managing all the stakeholders was super important.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">That ultimately made us really successful. LinkedIn then did a series of acquisitions that unfortunately weren&apos;t as successful.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1130" style=";color:black;"></a>
 What did you learn from this?</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">Their biggest learning was that going from a small startup to a large company works only if the founders have worked at a large company before. You really can&apos;t maintain, &quot;We will treat you as a startup within the larger company.&quot;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I ended up mentoring a bunch of PMs from the other acquisitions on how to be effective at the executive leadership pieces, such as getting resources, cutting through red tape, and how to be compelling with different kinds of people.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">While I was there, I kept telling LinkedIn that we should be going after sales professionals directly. I started a small project with a few engineers and got a chance to present it to an executive off-site.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">LinkedIn saw our project and said we needed to launch it aggressively. So we ended up launching and grew the team from 8 to 500, including 400 people in direct sales. During my tenure there it grew to about $200 million in revenue. I went from being an IC PM to being GM of a division and managing a public P&amp;L. Every week I met with the CFO, and if our forecast was 10% off from the actual, I got grilled on it.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1131" style=";color:black;"></a>
 What inspired you to start Notejoy?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I was doing quite well at LinkedIn as the GM of the division, but it wasn&apos;t as rewarding to me as being down in the trenches. So, even though I was excelling, I knew I wanted to return to my roots of starting a company.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I started Notejoy with my wife, Ada. We realized the reason we work so well together is because we have complementary skill sets. I lead product, design and engineering. She leads growth, analytics, marketing, legal, finance, accounting, operations, and everything else. That makes a clear separation of roles and responsibilities and works really well.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The insight for Notejoy came from my experience at LinkedIn. We found that 90% of the information people needed to know to do their job well stayed in email, in Slack, or in their heads. So much institutional knowledge was being lost. Our idea was to build a tool that you could use from the beginning of the project that scaled with you to that team collaboration scenario. That thesis has proven out and we now have teams that use us for all sorts of use cases.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It&apos;s been super fun to return to my roots in entrepreneurship. What I love about it is that every day my job is different. I&apos;m worrying about monetization versus user acquisition versus core feature development. I talk to my customers every single day. I do a bunch of customer support. I&apos;m absolutely loving it.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1132" style=";color:black;"></a>
 How would a PM know if becoming a founder and CEO might be a good path for them?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There are a bunch of dimensions of being a CEO that you don&apos;t really experience in a classic product management role. One is P&amp;L responsibility. You have to be very sensitive to costs, such as hiring and server costs. The CEO ultimately owns the budget. Another big difference is that the CEO ends up being the de facto head of sales. Customers want to talk to the CEO.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">One of the common things I hear from PMs is that they hate having to spend a lot of time on executive management, influence without authority, and coordination meetings. If that&apos;s you, I don&apos;t think you&apos;d want to become a CEO because you&apos;re still going to have that huge coordination role. There&apos;s no getting out of it.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">A big part of enjoying the CEO role is having a deep self awareness of what parts you like and don&apos;t like, and what parts you&apos;re good and not good at. Initially, you&apos;re just going to have to do it all. But you can very quickly get to the point where you realize what your strengths and passions are, and build the right team around you to really solve for it.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Another thing is that too many people conflate starting a company with going down the traditional VC-funded path. Many entrepreneurs assume they have autonomy, but as soon as you take funding and have a board, a board member is worse than any boss that you have ever had.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Notejoy is 100% bootstrapped. We had the opportunity to raise funding, but we chose a bootstrapped process. It changes the very nature of what it means to be an entrepreneur and how you run your company. It enables the company to be much more oriented around our values—for example, not launching until something meets my quality bar, or growing the company at a pace that we think makes sense.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1133" style=";color:black;"></a>
 What advice would you give to PMs who want to advance in their careers?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The first thing is realizing there&apos;s so many different kinds of PM roles, and really trying to figure out which one&apos;s right for you.</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-2">
<span class="CharOverride-1">A builder</span>
 is your classic feature PM, responsible for taking an existing product and coming up with new features to delight the end user. The builder is about talking to and delighting customers. It&apos;s really about the customer experience.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-2">
<span class="CharOverride-1">A tuner PM</span>
 is an optimization PM, like a growth or monetization PM. It&apos;s much more analytically rigorous and is higher velocity in terms of A/B tests. It&apos;s much more about the <a id="_idIndexMarker893"></a>
 metrics. If you love being a builder PM, you might not like being a tuner PM.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-2">
<span class="CharOverride-1">The innovator PM</span>
 is about building a brand new product for a new audience. There&apos;s a lot of uncertainty in being an innovator. Your project might fail. Maybe the audience was wrong. A lot of people try it and realize they&apos;re happier as a builder with more clear wins.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Even if your aspiration is to be an innovator PM, start as a builder PM.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">Early in your career, it&apos;s important to get some wins under your belt. I&apos;ve met PMs that worked at three startups and none of them became household names. Now they&apos;re struggling to get that role in a larger company. Innovation roles don&apos;t do much to help build your credibility as a successful PM unless they succeed.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Early on in your career, I&apos;d encourage people to try all three roles in a larger company like Facebook, Dropbox, or Airbnb. There are plenty of opportunities to move around every 18 months or so and try something different.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Another dimension is consumer versus <a id="_idIndexMarker894"></a>
 B2B. As a consumer PM, you end up in graphs and data. As a B2B PM, you end up talking to a lot of customers and having a relationship with them. I&apos;ve found B2B to be closer to the idea of delighting customers.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The final dimension is the size of the company. At a small company you do a lot of the pieces yourself. At a large company, you have a UX writer, a UX researcher, a product marketer. You spend a lot more time on coordination.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I think too often people say they want to be a senior PM or a group PM, without really figuring out what they love. They end up in a place where they&apos;re senior but not loving their job.</p>
