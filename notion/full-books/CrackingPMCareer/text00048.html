<span class="AllCaps-Bold _idGenCharOverride-1">When it comes</span>
 to career advice, remember to be careful. I know this sounds like an odd thing to say in a book about advancing your career. It&apos;d be like a doctor saying, &quot;be careful about medicine!&quot; But in actuality, it&apos;s a lot like that because as it turns out, doctors <span class="CharOverride-1">will</span>
 say that quite often—and they&apos;re possibly the best people to say so.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You see, I can tell people to move to a tech hub, seek out greater responsibilities, or go to a rapidly growing company—but all of this, while not necessarily incorrect, brushes by bigger questions about your career goals.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">What I like to tell people is that I can offer career advice, but I can&apos;t offer life advice. Life isn&apos;t a video game where you win by reaching the highest level by scoring the most points or making the most money. Life is about being happy, making an impact, and creating good in the world. Or—I don&apos;t know. What do <span class="CharOverride-1">you</span>
 think it&apos;s about?</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor945" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Figuring out what matters</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">By reflecting on your own career goals, you can open up opportunities to move in more rewarding directions. You can make intentional choices about where to spend your time. Which of these seem most important to you?</p>

<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Your societal and cultural background might tell you that factors like learning are ’good’ and factors like <a id="_idIndexMarker751"></a>
 validation are ’bad.’ Don&apos;t let cultural stereotypes get in the way of understanding yourself!</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In truth, at least to some extent, almost everyone wants to make money and have people see them as being important and successful. That is a totally normal drive. So, if those things speak to you, listen. You won&apos;t be doing yourself any favors by pretending you&apos;re not motivated by something when you are.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">

 Visualization Exercises</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Career goals are more like visions than commitments. They don&apos;t lock you in, rather, they should motivate decisions about your future. Much like a product vision, career goals should be tested and validated. Sometimes, you set out with one set of goals, but time, experience, and life circumstances shifts these goals. Be open to that change.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">To begin developing goals, or to update them, take some time to think deeply and do some visioning exercises. You&apos;ll want at least an hour to start, but you&apos;ll probably mull over your ideas for a week or more.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As you do these visioning exercises, remember that it&apos;s okay to come up with more than one idea. The goal is to gain some clarity into what appeals to you and what doesn&apos;t.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor955"></a>

 Zone of Genius</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In his book <span class="CharOverride-1">The Big Leap</span>
 , Gay Hendricks introduces the idea of working in your &quot;zone of genius.&quot; Many people get stuck spending most of their time in the &quot;zone of excellence&quot; where they are really skilled and valuable, but feel unsatisfied. In contrast, when you work in your &quot;zone of genius,&quot; you&apos;re excellent <span class="CharOverride-1">and</span>
 it feels great. You get in the flow and lose track of time, and you feel alive and fulfilled. This is the place where you&apos;re using your unique talents.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">To find your zone of genius, Hendricks presents four questions for you to reflect on:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">What do you love to do most? (You love it so much you can do it for long stretches of time without getting tired or bored.)</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">What work do you do that doesn&apos;t actually feel like work?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">In your work, what produces the highest ratio of abundance and satisfaction to the amount of time spent?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">What is your unique ability? What unique ability of yours, fully realized and put to work, can provide enormous value to you and/or your company?</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Write down ten instances in your life when you felt really fulfilled and proud of what you did. What exactly made each time so special? What aspects were fulfilling? Find a friend or mentor to share with and look for patterns. It&apos;s helpful to have an outside perspective since your zone of genius will be so intuitive to you that you might not even notice your unique talents.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor956"></a>
 Imagining your ideal job</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here are some prompts to help you imagine your ideal job:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">What kind of challenges do you enjoy?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Which of your strengths do you like to use?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">What are you passionate about?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">What would you do if you had enough money to never have to work again?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">How would you change your current job to make it better?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">What would you want to do if you couldn&apos;t work at your current company anymore?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Who do you admire? Who are your role models? What about them do you want to emulate? What would you like to do differently than them?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">If you imagine three, five, or ten years in the future, what would you love to be doing?</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You can also look at <a href="text00051.html#_idTextAnchor1047">Chapter 36: Beyond PM</a>
 for ideas of roles outside of product management.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor957" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Preferences and <a id="_idIndexMarker754" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Tradeoffs</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Getting into the details, here are some questions to ask yourself. If you&apos;re not sure about some of them, you can try talking to people at different companies and in different roles to learn more about them.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor958"></a>
 What stage of company do you prefer?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">An early-stage company that hasn&apos;t found their product-market fit will feel very different from a growth stage company that&apos;s scaling, or an established company.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">How much risk can you tolerate? Are you better at finding great ideas, or figuring out the important details? Are you more excited by innovation, or scale? Do you like needing to do a little bit of every job, or would you prefer working around expert marketers, salespeople, and researchers?</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor959"></a>
 Are you drawn to a particular type of product, or do you mostly want to go where you can make the largest impact?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Some PMs have a clear idea of what type of product they&apos;d like to work on. They know that they want to work on a music app, or software that helps healthcare workers, or developer platforms. Others are open to working on any type of product, and find that they are passionate about a wide range of customer problems.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Are you more motivated by impacting a lot of people a tiny bit, or a few people a lot? Do you care more about alleviating pain, or bringing delight? Do you crave cutting edge innovations? Do you prefer the kind of impact that shows up in a user study, or in financial metrics?</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor960"></a>
 What <a id="_idIndexMarker755"></a>
 salary range would you need to feel comfortable?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Large companies tend to pay well. A senior PM with seven years of experience might make as much money as a doctor, but without the medical school debt. If money is a big motivation, you might not need to advance as far as you assume. You can research salary information online to get a better sense of what various levels offer on average.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you&apos;re looking to improve your compensation, the type and size of the company you work for usually matters more than your level. Bigger companies tend to pay more than smaller ones. For-profit companies will typically pay more than non-profits. Modern tech companies often pay more than more traditional companies.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Even among similar companies, compensation philosophies can vary wildly. Some startups put a low cap on salary and compensate mainly in equity, while others don&apos;t. Also, pay attention to the cost of living and income tax as those can make a big difference in your take-home (net) pay.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor961"></a>
 How important is keeping your options open?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you choose to gain broad exposure to a diverse set of teams, you&apos;ll need to spend more time ramping up and learning. It might take you longer to start delivering a lot of value, but you&apos;ll probably find that you can handle a variety of circumstances later on.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor962"></a>
 &quot;Live to work&quot; or &quot;work to live?&quot;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Do you want your job to be your passion, or do you need time to support your passion outside of work?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Some teams expect you to work long hours and be available on the weekends. On other teams, everyone packs up at the end of the day, and doesn&apos;t think about work until the next morning. If there&apos;s a mismatch between you and the team <a id="_idIndexMarker756"></a>
 culture, you&apos;re likely to become frustrated.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It&apos;s also worth it to consider what other aspects of team culture are important to you. On some teams, the people become close friends and invite each other over for barbeques on the weekends. Other teams are cordial but keep work and personal life separate. Some teams are chatty during the day, while others keep things strictly professional and stay heads-down working.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor963"></a>
 What is your risk tolerance now, and in the future?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Life events such as taking time off work to travel, starting a family, or supporting a spouse while they go back to school can be an important factor in the level of risk you wish to tolerate.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Take a look at the credentials you&apos;ve built up, your savings, and your risk tolerance. You might realize that right now is the ideal time for you to take a risk. Or, you might decide to go with something more secure now so you can take risks (or take it easy) in the future.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor964" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Creating a personal development plan</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It&apos;s very easy to let personal development take a back seat when you&apos;re busy, and, to a certain extent, it should. The most important aim of your career will usually be shipping successful products, not writing blog posts. That said, you want to make sure you&apos;re not so heads-down that you forget to invest in yourself.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Draft a rough outline of some key milestones along your path to achieving your career goals. Then, pick a few milestones for the next 6-12 months and turn them into concrete plans.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">What can you do to make progress towards those milestones? Consider action items such as:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Analyzing a competitor&apos;s product and presenting your findings to your team.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Creating a long-term vision for your product area.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Reaching out to three people in the industry you&apos;re interested in for coffee chats.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Writing a blog post about how your team runs experiments.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Write your plans down (with dates) and commit to them. Set yourself a reminder to revisit those milestones when the deadlines come.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor965" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Key Takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Take the time to reflect on your career goals</span>
 : You don&apos;t need to commit to anything, but the world of potential goals might be much broader than you originally imagined. Once you understand your goals, you can make better choices to achieve them.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Invest in yourself</span>
 : Create a personal development plan and commit to a few milestones. Your action items can be directly related to your current job, or they can be about exploring new paths. Keep in mind, however, that launching successful products is the most important part of a PM career.</li>
