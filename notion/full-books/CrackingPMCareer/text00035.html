<p class="First-Paragraph---Main-Book">
<span class="AllCaps-Bold _idGenCharOverride-1">If you ever</span>
 had a group project in college, you probably know this story. You get assigned to a team of three or four others—or maybe you pick them from the limited options.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Two weeks into the project, Chen has gone missing. You see him in class (it&apos;s hard to miss him when he stumbles in ten minutes late, clutching a Starbucks cup), but somehow he&apos;s never at the team meetings. Bethany at least is honest. Between swim practice and her campus job, she just can&apos;t do much. &quot;I&apos;m cool with whatever,&quot; she says—as though that&apos;s generous. Aarti tries to help, but it&apos;s clear she&apos;s a little lost. You find a small, isolated piece to hand off to her, and hope for the best.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">So it&apos;s come down to just you and your buddy Tobin. This is unfortunate, but what are you going to do? Complain to the professor? &quot;Not my problem,&quot; she&apos;ll say, &quot;Figure it out.&quot;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Maybe the professor truly doesn&apos;t care. Maybe she feels there&apos;s no good way to get involved. Or maybe she figures that this is good preparation for the real world. In school and at work, you have to <span class="CharOverride-1">figure it out</span>
 .</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This is what an ownership mentality is. And it&apos;s as important in the real world as it is in school.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You need to take full responsibility for leading your team to success. You need to be willing to get your hands dirty and do whatever it takes, even if those tasks aren&apos;t included in your job description. You need to step up and take the lead so that other people can focus on their own work. Acting like an owner not only helps your team; it also shows that you&apos;re ready for expanded responsibilities.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor627" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Responsibilities</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor628"></a>
 Fill in the whitespace</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Early in his career, Sage Kitamorn worked on a product that had dedicated testers, but no strategy on how to turn the discipline of testing into quality. No one in the organization thought it was their responsibility.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Kitamorn saw the gap and stepped up:</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">I decided to author a checklist of how we could determine that a build was good. I worked with the testers to build reusable scripts and ensure we covered all of the flows. At first, I wondered whether I was overstepping, but soon the whole team saw the benefit of higher quality. As a PM, it was my role to do whatever was needed to create a great product.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Product management is fundamentally a &quot;whitespace&quot; role. If there&apos;s something that needs to be done and no one else is doing it, the PM needs to take responsibility for it. Sometimes the gap is obvious, for example when there&apos;s no user researcher. Other times it looks like someone else should be filling the gap, but they don&apos;t realize they&apos;re supposed to, don&apos;t have time to, or don&apos;t have the skills to.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It can be a delicate situation when you step up to fill in a gap that should have been owned by someone else. Ideally, you can turn it into a partnership by aligning on goals. If not, you&apos;ll need to decide if the issue is important enough to risk ruffling feathers. If you&apos;re not sure, check with your manager.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor629"></a>
 Take responsibility for the full customer experience</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Your title might be <span class="CharOverride-1">product</span>
 manager, but you need to take responsibility for making sure all of your non-product partner teams are successful too. That doesn&apos;t mean you don&apos;t trust the other teams or that you&apos;ll micromanage them, but you should set up checkpoints to make sure everyone has what they need to keep everything on track.</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">When you work with product marketing, make sure the messages match the benefits and <a id="_idIndexMarker496"></a>
 target audience you were going after, and that all of the supporting material is ready for the launch date.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">If you work with salespeople, you&apos;ll want to understand how they sell your product and to ensure they have everything they need to do it effectively. This could be talking points, demo scripts, or features that help make a demo more compelling.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As you advance in your career, you&apos;ll want to expand your understanding of the factors that tie into product work. For example, you might need to learn how data scientists are allocated so that you can ensure your team gets the support it needs.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor630"></a>
 Proactively share your team&apos;s progress, challenges and accomplishments</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As the PM, you&apos;re responsible for making sure stakeholders know how your team is doing. If things are going well, they can celebrate with you; if they&apos;re going badly, they can help.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As Jules Walter, who led monetization at Slack, shared:</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">A lot of people are afraid to tell leaders when something is hard, even though the work actually is hard. If you don&apos;t educate executives on the challenges, your team won&apos;t get the full resources they need or recognition they deserve.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Recognition is important for more than just your <a id="_idIndexMarker497"></a>
 ego. If leaders don&apos;t know about your team&apos;s good work, they won&apos;t take it into account when allocating projects and resources.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">But, if you share your team&apos;s accomplishments with leadership, you&apos;ll be trusted with more important work and more autonomy in the future.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Additionally, your team&apos;s morale will get a boost from this recognition. Your teammates will feel more motivated knowing that their hard work is appreciated—leading them to accomplish more in the future.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor631" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Growth Practices</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor632"></a>
 Find the answers for other people</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When you&apos;re new on a team, people will ask you many questions that you won&apos;t know the answer to. It can be tempting to just tell that person how they can answer the question for themselves: which engineer to speak to, where to look in the documentation, and so on. After all, that will save time, won&apos;t it? Plus, they&apos;ll learn how to find the answers themselves.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When you&apos;re in a senior position <a id="_idIndexMarker498"></a>
 mentoring someone, it makes sense to encourage them to find the answers for themselves. However, that isn&apos;t appropriate when a peer comes to you as the PM of a team. The PM is supposed to be the cross-functional point-of-contact. A different way of looking at those questions is to see them as a signal. Someone asked you the question because they thought it was important and they thought you would know the answer.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Instead, use this phrase that Dare Obasanjo recommends: &quot;I don&apos;t have the answer but I&apos;ll look into it and get back to you.&quot; It lets you keep your position of leadership and as the point person even though you don&apos;t have the answer yet.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor633"></a>
 Dig into the details yourself</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As a PM, you get a lot of data in summary form. The head of operations might hand you a list of the top ten customer complaints. You might run some data analysis on the most used features. Those summaries, however, don&apos;t always tell the full story.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As the PM, you should drill into the data to double check the conclusions and make sure you&apos;re not taking anything for granted. You need to understand the data so you can defend it and form your own opinions about it.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Beth Grant, a manager on Apple&apos;s Maps Data team, shared a story about when digging into the details made a big difference:</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">We were creating the buildings layer for Maps, and we found that the operations side of reviewing the computer-annotated images was taking much too long. From previous experience, we knew the editing effort should be 10x less than what we were seeing, and we wondered if we needed to improve the computer-created buildings.</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">We decided to dig into the details and see exactly what kind of changes they were making. What we found was that we had a bug in the editor instructions instead of in the software. When we reviewed a few samples of editor work, we realized that many of the edits weren&apos;t going to make a visible impact. For example, a huge portion of the recorded edits were spent zoomed way in to nudge a corner of a building a couple of centimeters—a distance not even perceivable in the end product. It totally reframed our next steps. Instead of updating the computer algorithms, we were able to change the instructions to editors to reduce low-impact edits.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Sometimes PMs get scared away from looking at the data when they think it would take a long time to look at all of it. Grant, however, knew she only needed to dig into a sample of the data to gain a lot of insight. If she hadn&apos;t double checked the details, she might have wasted her team&apos;s time on an unnecessary software fix, instead of implementing the operational fix that was better for everyone.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor634"></a>
 Contribute to the broader PM team and company at large <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As you advance through your career, you move from taking responsibility for your feature team&apos;s success to taking responsibility for the entire product, and even company&apos;s success. Your ownership mentality expands in scope.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This expansion is especially important if you&apos;re interested in people management. As you move up the management ladder, you&apos;re expected to contribute more and more to the broader organization as your direct work on the product decreases. Even as an IC, the most senior levels include an expectation of driving impact beyond your immediate team.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here are a few examples of the ways you might contribute:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Repurpose what you&apos;ve learned into materials for your peers</span>
 . You could share a template you designed, set up training for something you learned, or put together a process to remove an annoyance. You don&apos;t need any permission to do this; just send something out to the other PMs, and ask them to let you know if they find it helpful.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Volunteer for tedious work that gets you access to higher level meetings</span>
 . Executive meetings give you important insight into how the company leaders think. You usually won&apos;t be allowed into these meetings, but sometimes you can find a way in by volunteering to take notes or prepare data.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Pick up some strategic exploration work that no one else is exploring</span>
 . One of the best ways to become a leader of a new team is to be the person who identifies the need and does the original exploration. For example, you could research how to take on a competitor or go after a new audience.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Pick up grunt work that leaders really need someone to do</span>
 . This can be nuanced since you don&apos;t want to put a lot of time into something that isn&apos;t appreciated. Wait for something that&apos;s been clearly identified as valuable.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Work with a team you&apos;re considering transferring to</span>
 . Sometimes you can take on a small project with the potential team. You get to learn if you&apos;d really like it and they get to see what you&apos;re capable of.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Lead a PM team or cross-functional process and improve it</span>
 . Volunteer to lead hackathons, organize product review meetings, run an onboarding session, or take on another responsibility that impacts a large number of people. Put on your &quot;product discovery hat&quot; and see how you can make it even better.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It does take extra time and effort to pick up extra work, but these internal contributions can have a multiplier effect on your impact. Making your teammates more effective is an incredibly leveraged way to increase your value.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor635" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Concepts and Frameworks</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor636"></a>
 What does it mean to act like an owner</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">One day, William was surprised to overhear the VP of product chatting with William&apos;s manager about his project: the new site navigation. His manager was describing the project, talking about the progress and challenges. Why wasn&apos;t the VP talking directly to William?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The problem was that the VP didn&apos;t see William as the leader of the team. That meant that, not only did his manager need to waste time answering questions about the navigation project, but the answers weren&apos;t even fully up-to-date. Even worse, William was missing out on hearing useful feedback directly from the VP. If William had made it clear he was responsible for the navigation project, the VP might have come directly to him.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here are some examples of what showing <a id="_idIndexMarker499"></a>
 ownership looks like:</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor637"></a>
 Taking responsibility for all of the components that drive success</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Not showing ownership</span>
 : Focusing on getting your own responsibilities done, without also ensuring that everything else is being taken care of.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Not showing ownership</span>
 : Pushing bad outcomes onto other people and claiming that they weren&apos;t your fault.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Showing ownership</span>
 : Double checking that all of the teams involved in a launch are on top of their responsibilities.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Showing ownership</span>
 : Reflecting on what you can learn and how you can personally drive better outcomes after each experience, even if the problems seem, at a surface level, to be someone else&apos;s fault.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Showing ownership</span>
 : Taking pride in your product and staying motivated to go after quality even if it takes a long time.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor638"></a>
 Identifying what needs to be done and doing it</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Not showing ownership</span>
 : Making excuses that you followed the rules and did everything you were supposed to do.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Not showing ownership</span>
 : Waiting for someone else to give you instructions. Expecting someone else to take the lead.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Not showing ownership</span>
 : Quietly accepting decisions that you think aren&apos;t right. Following consensus without forming your own opinion.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Showing ownership</span>
 : Not expecting the playbook to be complete. Using your own judgment for ways you can help. Filling the whitespace.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor639"></a>
 Being the primary representative for your team</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Not showing ownership</span>
 : Frequently redirecting questions about your team to other people.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Showing ownership</span>
 : Learning how to answer questions from stakeholders or going to find the answer yourself.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Showing ownership</span>
 : Proactively sending status updates about how your team is doing so other people don&apos;t have to ask.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When you act like an owner you signal to the people around you that you&apos;ve got everything under control and they can rely on you.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor640" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Key Takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">As a PM, there&apos;s nothing that&apos;s &quot;not your job&quot;</span>
 : It&apos;s your responsibility to launch successful products that work across the entire customer experience. If there&apos;s a gap, either because no one has the appropriate role, or because the most appropriate person isn&apos;t doing a good enough job, it&apos;s your responsibility to make sure that gap gets filled. Be kind and diplomatic, but don&apos;t let your product fail.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">If people don&apos;t see you as the leader of your team, you&apos;ll be overlooked</span>
 : When executives or other people at the company have questions, opportunities, ideas, or feedback for your team, they&apos;ll want to talk to someone who shows an ownership mentality—someone who will do the work to answer their questions or ensure their information gets to the right place. If they don&apos;t believe you&apos;re that person, you&apos;ll be left out of valuable conversations and end up hearing important context second-hand.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Taking ownership over product-team or company-wide processes is a good way to show you&apos;re ready for expanded responsibilities</span>
 : The advanced levels of product management involve broader responsibility to the entire organization. Activities that help the organization (instead of just your feature team) might seem like extra work or a distraction, but they&apos;re important for your career.</li>
