<span class="AllCaps-Bold _idGenCharOverride-1">By the time</span>
 Maya joined the team, the situation with Kim had gotten out of hand. Simply put, the other PMs hated working with her.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Kim was complex. A lot of bad mixed with a lot of good. She had razor-sharp product sense… but that tended to turn into razor-sharp criticism. She was action-oriented and tried to help other teams… but she did so by pushing the point-person aside. Her engineers loved her… but she drove a highly talented designer to quit. Ultimately, her attitude was getting in the way of not only her own promotion, but the company&apos;s success as well.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Maya, too, felt taken aback by the way Kim questioned her decisions and dismissed her input. Other PMs apparently handled Kim with an effective—but not necessarily healthy—approach: avoidance. They didn&apos;t invite her to meetings, didn&apos;t share their work with her, and so on.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">That wouldn&apos;t work for Maya or her team. They needed to collaborate closely with Kim&apos;s team. Maya committed herself to developing a healthy <a id="_idIndexMarker450"></a>
 relationship with Kim.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Maya reached out to Kim for a friendly chat. During that chat, Maya realized that Kim had been burned by sloppy decision-making in the past and had trouble trusting new coworkers. Kim really cared about her team and wanted to protect them from any mistakes.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">With that deeper understanding, Maya was able to intentionally build trust and develop an effective working relationship with Kim. Maya showed her work early and explained her reasoning. When Kim shared negative feedback about Maya&apos;s project, Maya thanked her for it and asked follow-up questions to understand the concerns. They took time for regular coffee chats, and even the occasional lunch. When Kim&apos;s big project launched, Maya bought her a pack of her favorite candy to celebrate.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">What Maya understood—and the other PMs didn&apos;t—is that it&apos;s not sufficient to say &quot;well, it&apos;s <span class="CharOverride-1">their</span>
 fault.&quot; It takes two to tango, but if the dance of collaboration isn&apos;t working, it&apos;s your responsibility to fix it. No matter how stubborn, grumpy, or unreliable the other person is, a PM is expected to find a way to work together smoothly.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor543" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Responsibilities</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor544"></a>
 Treat people like <a id="_idIndexMarker451"></a>
 partners</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Almost all collaboration skills come down to the mindset of treating everyone you work with like equal and valuable partners—like they&apos;re a member of the team. That includes your engineers, designers, user researchers, data scientists, security and infrastructure, sales and support people, marketing, and even legal and finance teams.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When people feel like they&apos;re a member of the team, they&apos;ll work with you to help the team succeed. If you treat people like obstacles or servants they&apos;ll redirect their energy towards other teams where they feel included.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here are some ways to treat people like partners:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Include people early in the product life cycle and give them a chance to influence the direction.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Learn about their concerns and take them seriously.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Include them in your core team meetings or create regular partner meetings.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Say &quot;our launch&quot; instead of &quot;my launch.&quot;</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Invite them to launch celebrations.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you notice your &quot;partners&quot; frequently becoming frustrated at your team, that can be a sign that they haven&apos;t felt treated as a partner. Review the list above, broach the issue with them, ask how you can improve.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor545"></a>
 <a id="_idTextAnchor546"></a>
 Create <a id="_idIndexMarker452"></a>
 Psychological Safety</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">Studies have shown that one of the most important factors in high performing teams is psychological safety: the belief that you won&apos;t be punished or shamed for making a mistake.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Many PMs accidentally reduce the feeling of psychological safety on their team. PMs love to point out problems and make suggestions (it&apos;s often easier than pointing out the good stuff), but sometimes it feels condescending, or like one-upmanship. They might be too quick to shut down ideas, or let retrospectives turn into a blame game.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Check in with your team to see how well your team is doing on psychological safety (perhaps anonymously), and if there&apos;s a problem, address it. If you&apos;ve been letting your bad moods bring the rest of the team down, stop it.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor547"></a>
 Resolve <a id="_idIndexMarker453"></a>
 conflicts peacefully</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Conflict is part of work. If you&apos;ve never gotten into a conflict, then you either haven&apos;t worked on anything important and complex, or you&apos;re just so good at managing conflicts that they don&apos;t feel like conflicts to you.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Conflicts arise because people have different goals, preferences, and ideas of how to solve problems. People who are great at collaboration catch those differences early and work with the other person to resolve them in a way that works for everyone.</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Find the higher-level places where you agree and work down from there.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Assume other people are competent and have good intentions.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Don&apos;t let things fester.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Don&apos;t accuse or blame.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-001-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00031.html#endnote-001">1</a>
</span>
</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If necessary, you might even send in your <a id="_idIndexMarker454"></a>
 mentor or manager to help diffuse the situation. You don&apos;t want to be perceived as someone who &quot;tattles&quot; whenever there&apos;s an issue, but it&apos;s better than letting an issue drag on and completely burning the bridge.</p>
<p class="BODY_Sidebar-Heading" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor548" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Ask prickly people to mentor you</p>
<p class="BODY_Sidebar" style=";color:black;">One great trick for moving people from adversaries to allies comes from Niffer Nan. She once worked with a new engineering lead who seemed to block her at every turn and generally acted like he didn&apos;t respect her.</p>
<p class="BODY_Sidebar" style=";color:black;">Instead of getting defensive, she asked him to ramp her up on technical aspects of the new area and regularly asked for his advice. He took her under his wing and became one of her biggest advocates.</p>
<p class="BODY_Sidebar" style=";color:black;">People generally love to be respected as experts, and this approach can quickly defuse a power struggle.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor549" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Growth Practices</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor550"></a>
 Make time to bond with coworkers</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It&apos;s easier to work with people when you see them as real people, and even easier to work with them when you like them. When you build a foundation of friendliness or friendship, it creates a buffer that protects the <a id="_idIndexMarker455"></a>
 relationship from mistakes and misunderstanding. When you feel like you&apos;re working with friends, work becomes more fun and less stressful.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When you work in the same office as your coworkers, you can grab lunch together or go for coffee in the afternoon. You can walk by one another in common areas and stop to chat. If you feel up for it, you can even hang out outside of work and engage in activities like board game nights, soccer teams, meeting up as a group for a movie, or team dinners.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When you work remotely, it&apos;s still possible to bond. Take the first few minutes of meetings to ask them how their weekend was. Create a chat channel to share silly memes. Host a &quot;video happy hour&quot; at the end of the workweek to relax and chat. Set aside some fun time during the time you&apos;re all in town together, or go to a conference together. (See <a href="text00020.html#_idTextAnchor398">&quot;Remote Work&quot; in Chapter 13</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Many companies have some budget for &quot;<a id="_idIndexMarker456"></a>
 morale events&quot; or &quot;offsites&quot; like a sushi-making class, pottery lessons, or indoor skydiving. See if you can organize something for your team once a quarter. Events where people are learning to do something new, or where there&apos;s a little bit of competition tend to be favorites.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-002-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00031.html#endnote-002">2</a>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">The people you work with today can be the foundation of your network in the future. Some of your coworkers might start their own company one day, or they might be the people you recruit to join yours.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Don&apos;t forget to connect with people on LinkedIn and share personal email addresses when you leave!</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor551"></a>
 Optimize for long-term <a id="_idIndexMarker457"></a>
 relationships</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You don&apos;t just want to achieve the best results on the current project, you want to achieve great results over time.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When you take this perspective, it&apos;s easier to invest in relationships and compromise. You might disagree with your designer or engineer, but decide that it&apos;s not important enough to fight over. You might hesitate to let a teammate <a id="_idIndexMarker458"></a>
 stretch into a responsibility you know you could do better, but in the long run, it will be good to build their skills.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This advice can apply even in extreme cases. You might have the idea that you can push your team really hard to deliver outstanding results or save the team from a disaster, but the damage to your reputation might not be recoverable.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor552" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Concepts and Frameworks</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There are a variety of approaches to assessing one&apos;s personality, each with its own pros and cons.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Fundamentally, these assessments each seek to distill us down to core traits or bucket us in some fashion. The reality, however, is more complicated.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Most people, for example, aren&apos;t cleanly extroverted or introverted, but rather are somewhat in the middle. Or perhaps they report being high on some attribute, but they are judging themselves relative to a skewed sample. Or they exhibit one trait at work, but another at home.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This is all terribly messy. Embrace it!</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">Despite their inherent inaccuracy, personality assessments have value. They encourage us to think more deeply about ourselves and our teammates, and understand how people are different.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Consider, for example, the <a id="_idIndexMarker459"></a>
 Myers-Briggs (MBTI) assessment. True, its validity is very much debated among psychologists (so much so that it will be conspicuously absent from this section—sorry, MBTI fans!). But it can nonetheless introduce the extrovert to the idea that, although they are energized by going to a team <a id="_idIndexMarker460"></a>
 morale event, another person might need some quiet space to recharge after that.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">We present the frameworks here in that light. No, none of these are The One True Answer. But there is utility to be gleaned from each.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor553"></a>
 The Big 5</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The <a id="_idIndexMarker461"></a>
 Big 5 doesn&apos;t attempt to put you into a little bucket. Perhaps that&apos;s for the best.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Rather, you are rated from low to high on five attributes, each of which is independent of the rest. These are believed by many researchers to be the core building blocks of personality.</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Conscientiousness:</span>
 This is about impulse control, self-discipline, and following through. Conscientiousness is generally a positive trait, for product management and many other roles. A person who scores low might be unreliable, might procrastinate, or fail to be organized about their work.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Extraversion:</span>
 While many extraverts are chatty and highly social, this doesn&apos;t have to be the case. Extraversion and its counterpart—introversion—refer to how you get your energy. Do you leave a party with your friends feeling energized? Or do you feel drained and like you need a night off to recharge? Successful PMs can be either introverted or extraverted—or anywhere in between.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Agreeableness:</span>
 Agreeable individuals tend to value getting along with others, and they take into account other people&apos;s feelings and they exhibit more prosocial behavior. A person low on agreeableness can be seen as argumentative, uncooperative, competitive—or just somewhat obnoxious. High agreeableness can make you more likable, but when it gets very high, it can also be seen as lacking leadership.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Neuroticism (or Emotional Instability):</span>
 This is essentially a measure of how strong your emotional reactions are. A person who shows high neuroticism gets stressed, sad, or angry easily. A very high score here could pose an issue in one&apos;s career. A low score indicates that you&apos;re more emotionally stable and relaxed.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Openness to Experience:</span>
 High scorers here are more open to unconventional ideas. They are often imaginative and flexible, and readily try new approaches. Sounds good, right? Unfortunately, they can also be seen as unpredictable, or they can take <span class="CharOverride-1">too</span>
 many risks. A &quot;less open&quot; person might be less willing to dive into new ideas, but their skepticism and pragmatism can also offer benefits.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">We wish we could offer a platitude like &quot;no trait is inherently good or bad,&quot; but that&apos;s not really accurate—at least not for PMing. Realistically, high conscientiousness is probably better than low conscientiousness; low neuroticism is probably better than high neuroticism.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">What we can say is that even the &quot;good traits&quot; have downsides in the extremes, and you can find very successful leaders at any level of these traits.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You can have a weakness; everyone does. What&apos;s important is that you consider what traits might hold you back, and consider how to mitigate or manage them.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor554"></a>
 <a id="_idTextAnchor555"></a>
 The <a id="_idIndexMarker462"></a>
 Enneagram</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The Golden Rule—do unto others as you would have them do unto you—is wrong. It assumes that everyone wants to be treated the same way, and that&apos;s just isn&apos;t the case.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">At my first leadership training course, I was <span class="CharOverride-1">shocked</span>
 to learn that many people like to plan out what they say in advance, instead of thinking while they talk. I&apos;d assumed everyone was like me and would jump into the conversation. I realized I&apos;d been accidentally excluding some people.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This made me eager to learn more ways that my assumptions about other people could be wrong.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The model I&apos;ve found most useful at work, and personally, is the Enneagram.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-003-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00031.html#endnote-003">3</a>
</span>
</span>
 It identifies and defines nine personality types, each stemming from a different core desire and fear.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You don&apos;t need to believe that the enneagram system is &quot;true&quot; to get a lot of value from it. Just learning about some different ways that people look at the world can help you understand your coworkers better.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You may want to ask your coworkers which type they think they are and then look up information on how to work with people of their type. It can help you stop accidentally hitting people&apos;s buttons and learn to better appreciate their strengths.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here&apos;s a brief description of the types.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-004-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00031.html#endnote-004">4</a>
</span>
</span>
 Note that people are often not 100% any one type.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor556"></a>
 Type 1: The Reformer</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Also called the perfectionist, people who are type 1 have high standards. They can have trouble accepting that done is better than perfect. They are often willing to put in extra effort to get their work to their own quality bar. Appreciate their integrity and don&apos;t take it personally if they are overly critical.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor557"></a>
 Type 2: The Helper</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">People who are type 2 are empathetic and relationship-oriented. They might have trouble saying no. They are often motivated to help the people around them. Take the time to form genuine relationships with them and acknowledge the ways they help you.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor558"></a>
 Type 3: The Achiever</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Also called the performer, people who are type 3 are productive and ambitious. They might be impatient or overly competitive. They tend to be motivated by hitting goals and getting results. They thrive on all kinds of appreciation and recognition.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor559"></a>
 Type 4: The Individualist</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">People who are type 4 see themselves as unique and different. They can have trouble when they need to do mundane work. They tend to be motivated by work that has a higher purpose or achieves excellence. Appreciate their creativity and help them see the meaning and purpose behind their work.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor560"></a>
 Type 5: The Investigator</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Also known as the observer, people who are type 5 are thoughtful and strategic. They can face challenges from isolating themselves. They tend to be motivated by deeply understanding complex systems. Give them time to think things over and reach out to them for their thoughts.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor561"></a>
 Type 6: The Loyal Skeptic</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">People who are type 6 anticipate problems and create solutions. They can face challenges from being overly suspicious or when the rules change. They&apos;re motivated by being prepared and love to question everything. Share information with them early and often, and don&apos;t get offended by their questioning.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor562"></a>
 Type 7: The Enthusiast</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">People who are type 7 are imaginative and optimistic. They can have trouble staying focused and following through. They&apos;re motivated by exploring new ideas. Give them space to brainstorm and share their ideas.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor563"></a>
 Type 8: The Challenger</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Also known as the protector, people who are type 8 are decisive and resourceful. They can lean towards aggressiveness and run into trouble creating conflicts. They&apos;re motivated by moving fast and having autonomy. Don&apos;t shy away from their directness, and when they challenge you, see it as an attempt to suss out trouble in advance.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor564"></a>
 Type 9: The Peacemaker</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Also known as the mediator, people who are type 9 seek harmony and bring people together. They can face challenges from complacency and procrastination. They&apos;re great at leading people to resolve controversial decisions peacefully. Take the time to form a rapport with them. Don&apos;t try to rush them, instead encourage them to share their own needs.</p>
