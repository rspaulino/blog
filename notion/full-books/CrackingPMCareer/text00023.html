<p class="First-Paragraph---Main-Book">
<span class="AllCaps-Bold _idGenCharOverride-1">Companies have limited</span>
 resources, and the &quot;best&quot; products don&apos;t always win. It doesn&apos;t matter how fast you move if you&apos;re going in the wrong direction. It doesn&apos;t matter how well-designed your product is if people don&apos;t use it.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">That&apos;s why, at some point in your career, you&apos;ll probably hear that you need to be more strategic. It might leave you wondering, &quot;Now what?&quot;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When I first got this feedback, it was a gut punch. If I&apos;m bad at strategy, how can I ever be an amazing PM?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">But I misunderstood something that was very, very important.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Strategic skills are not innate; I could learn them. I could dissect the key components—vision, strategic framework, and roadmap—and learn tangible practices to improve them. I could solicit input from key sources, follow trends, evaluate risks, and pull these together into a clearer direction for the product.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Saying &quot;you need to be more strategic&quot; isn&apos;t like saying, &quot;you&apos;re bad at math and always will be.&quot; It&apos;s more like saying, &quot;you don&apos;t know geometry and you should learn it.&quot; This is a skill that you can learn—and that&apos;s what this chapter, and this part, is about.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor406" style=";color:black;"></a>
 What does it mean to be strategic?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Being strategic is about deciding where you want the product to go and making a plan to get there. It&apos;s about understanding the industry, market, and trends to predict what will be important in the future. It&apos;s about creating a vision, setting ambitious goals, and convincing your team that you&apos;re heading in the right direction. It&apos;s about evaluating different approaches and picking the best one. It&apos;s about sharing ideas for the big opportunities your team should work on next. It&apos;s about laying out the steps that get your team from start to finish.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Early in your career, you usually work with the strategy that was created by your product leader. You probably have some kind of framework for how you&apos;re choosing projects and prioritizing work, but you haven&apos;t advocated for that framework or painted a bold picture of the long-term goal that your team is working towards. Typically, while you help craft the details of your team&apos;s goals, you don&apos;t set the direction.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As you advance in your career, you&apos;ll need to expand your strategic skills. You&apos;ll need to be able to identify and research new strategic opportunities. You&apos;ll be expected to create a vision for addressing those opportunities and define what success looks like in ways that go beyond the pre-existing plan. You should be able to create a long-term roadmap that shows how all of the work fits together to achieve ambitious results. You should also be able to communicate clearly to drive alignment on the strategy and ensure that everyone on the team understands what they&apos;re working towards.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor407"></a>
 Strategic vs. not strategic</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Since it can be difficult to understand what being strategic means, here are a few examples.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor408"></a>
 Vision</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Not strategic</span>
 : Prioritizing projects based on the number of customer requests or the sales team ranking.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Strategic</span>
 : Painting an inspiring vision of what the product could be in two years and choosing projects that work towards that vision. Connecting the dots for stakeholders about how each project contributes to the larger goals they value.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor409"></a>
 Competitive framework</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Not strategic</span>
 : Analyzing the features competitors have and using that to guide your roadmap.</li>

<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Not strategic</span>
 : People aren&apos;t quite sure why you&apos;re saying yes or no to various pieces of work or what you&apos;re optimizing for. Some people&apos;s pet ideas keep getting resurfaced and they&apos;re frustrated that you haven&apos;t explained why the team isn&apos;t working on them.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Strategic</span>
 : You&apos;ve written up a clear, opinionated framework about which bets you&apos;re making and why.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor411"></a>
 Alignment with company strategy</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Not strategic</span>

</ul>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor412"></a>
 Systems thinking</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Not strategic</span>
 : Making short-sighted decisions without noticing the long-term or global implications. Inappropriately prioritizing the short term over the long term. Prioritizing the team over the company. Focusing on parts rather than the whole.</li>

</ul>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor413"></a>
 Long-term roadmapping</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Not strategic</span>
 : Talking about a big idea vaguely, without a plan of how to get there.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Strategic</span>
 : Writing up a quarter-by-quarter plan of what work to take on, and in what order, to achieve the vision. Highlighting which new skills the team needs to develop and where a larger team size would be most valuable.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor414"></a>
 Execution</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Not strategic</span>
 : The team always seems to be playing catch-up and can&apos;t find time for strategic work. Stuck doing incremental work. Not making progress on the long-term roadmap.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Strategic</span>
 : Making space for strategic work, even when it involves tough prioritization calls. Working with leadership to ensure the team has what it needs, whether that&apos;s more staffing or permission to drop non-strategic work.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor415"></a>
 Goal setting</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Not strategic</span>
 : Setting goals based on launching a predetermined solution and hitting the targets that you expect the solution to achieve.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Strategic</span>
 : Rallying the team around a single key success metric. Setting ambitious targets that change how the team looks at problems and finding new solutions.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor416"></a>
 Planning ahead</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Not strategic</span>
 : Focusing 100% on the upcoming launch and delivering it perfectly.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Strategic</span>
 : Once engineers have started working on the current launch, carving out time for researching, sketching, and forming opinions about what might come next.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor417"></a>
 Autonomy</p>

 : Working on the projects that your manager has asked you to work on.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Strategic</span>
 : Advocating to leadership which projects you believe the team should work on next. Advocating for new teams to be spun up.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor418"></a>
 Advocacy</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Not strategic</span>
 : You know what your strategy is and even wrote it down somewhere, but the engineers and designers on your team (and your manager) couldn&apos;t say what it is if asked.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Strategic</span>
 : Everyone on the team can recite a similar explanation of the strategy and goals. Leaders across the company understand your strategy and why it&apos;s important.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you&apos;re getting feedback that you&apos;re not strategic enough and can&apos;t figure out why, try showing the list to your manager and ask about the areas in need of focus.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor419" style=";color:black;"></a>
 What is a Product Strategy?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There&apos;s no standardized definition of what a product strategy is.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As you might imagine, this can create a lot of confusion. Many PMs think they have a strategy, and yet their manager keeps telling them they need to <span class="CharOverride-2">create</span>
 a strategy. What&apos;s going on?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There are three separate components that can make up a strategy. When there&apos;s confusion, it&apos;s usually because one of them is missing.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The three components of a product strategy are the product vision, the strategic framework, and the roadmap.</p>
<p class="Text-Center"><img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-1" src="Image00040.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Often, the head of product or CEO creates a strategy for the entire company, directors create a more focused strategy for their group, and individual PMs create even more focused strategies for their teams. This section will describe what you need to know about each component and how to create your own product strategy.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor420"></a>
 The product vision</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The <span class="CharOverride-1">product vision</span>
 is an inspiring description of the future we want to head towards. It could be high fidelity like a demo video, low fidelity like a storyboard, or even something as simple as a one-sentence vision statement.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A great product vision includes some specific details, insights, or opinions that bring the vision to life. The details will change over time, but the vision provides a North Star that the team and customers can get excited about.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Why have a product vision? The product vision inspires people and helps them quickly understand what they are working towards. It helps them understand how all of the individual pieces of work add up to something meaningful. Once they&apos;re bought into the vision, people will work hard to achieve it.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">
<a href="text00024.html#_idTextAnchor440">Chapter 15: Vision</a>
 goes into this in more detail.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor421"></a>
 The strategic framework</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The <span class="CharOverride-1">strategic</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-1">framework</span>
 is like the spec for your strategy.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It includes the high-level framing, goals, and principles of the strategy. It describes the target market. It talks about what bets you&apos;re making and why.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The framework aligns people to the approach for achieving your vision. When done well, it helps people remember the important parts of the strategy—for example, with concise taglines and memorable names for important concepts.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Why have a strategic framework? When people understand the framework, they&apos;re empowered to make good, fast decisions on their own. Also, if the framework is clearly defined, any erroneous assumptions can be more easily identified and fixed.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">
<a href="text00025.html#_idTextAnchor452">Chapter 16: Strategic Framework</a>
 goes into this in more detail.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor422"></a>
 The roadmap</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The <span class="CharOverride-1">roadmap</span>
 is the prioritized, sequenced, and roughly-costed plan of work that leads to achieving the vision. The roadmap shows which steps come first and which key milestones come next. It gives a rough sense of the scale of the problem (e.g., will it take a year or ten years to achieve the vision?).</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Why have a roadmap? The roadmap aligns people on the steps it will take to achieve the vision. The details of the roadmap will change over time, but the concreteness of the roadmap helps ground people on how much work is required and how many people need to be hired. The roadmap also provides a baseline against which to track progress, so that the team can assess if the current plan is working or needs to change.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">
<a href="text00026.html#_idTextAnchor474">Chapter 17: Roadmapping and Prioritization</a>
 goes into this in more detail.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor423" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Creating a product strategy</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You don&apos;t need to own an entire product to create a product strategy. You can, and should, create a strategy for any scope that encompasses multiple launches. Smaller strategies should ladder up to the broader strategies.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Creating a product strategy should be a collaborative process. You want to focus on getting buy-in from all of the important stakeholders. After all, the point of a strategy is to align people in a common direction. That said, most stakeholders will not be deeply involved in the day-to-day creation of the strategy.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor424"></a>
 Making the time</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Many PMs get stuck feeling that they don&apos;t have enough time for strategic thinking. There&apos;s a ton of urgent work and they already feel like they&apos;re behind.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you haven&apos;t already, go read <a href="text00020.html#_idTextAnchor349">Chapter 13: Get Things Done</a>
 .</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor425"></a>
 The mindset shift</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">To make time for strategic work, a PM needs to make the mindset shift from &quot;I&apos;m a great PM for my team&quot; to &quot;I&apos;m a great PM for my whole company.&apos;&apos;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You already show a small version of this mindset when you balance the needs of different members of your team. I never hear PMs say they can&apos;t make time for their designer because the engineers need them so much, or vice versa. No one likes to disappoint a teammate, but PMs know they need to support the whole team.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Imagine that your immediate team is one of your teammates, and the company is another teammate. You can&apos;t take the side of your team over what&apos;s best for the company. You need to support both.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Once you&apos;ve made the mindset shift from being a great PM for your team to being a great PM for your company, making time should become much easier. You still won&apos;t <span class="CharOverride-2">want</span>
 to drop work that would help your team, but it becomes an option you can consider against the tradeoffs.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor426"></a>
 Understand the importance of strategic work</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Since making time is a tradeoff, you need to start by understanding how important strategic and visioning work is.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">For many teams, visioning is critical. Imagine if the team at Apple had been so caught up in the day-to-day work of designing the new iPod that they didn&apos;t take a step back and realize they should be designing an iPhone instead.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You can always find incremental work to do by continuing along the current path. There will always be more customer requests to satisfy and more features to build. But, maybe there&apos;s a new direction that would deliver even more impact.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">By the time your current project wraps up, it will be too late to pursue innovative new directions for the next cycle. If you want to reconsider the strategy, you need to start early enough.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor427"></a>
 What if the engineering lead says you can&apos;t spare any time for strategic work?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here&apos;s the truth about your execution work: it will always expand to fit the amount of time you give it.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There are times you need to focus on execution, for example when a big launch is coming up. But, most of the time your team and the company will be better off if you make some time for strategic thinking.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Talk to your engineering lead and listen to their concerns. Once you know the concerns, you can handle them appropriately.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Some possible scenarios include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">They don&apos;t see the importance of strategic work</span>
 . If you can&apos;t convince them with your logic, you might need to put in a few extra hours to create a quick strategy draft on your own so that you can show them the value.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">They want to stay engineering-driven, and not have a PM tell them what to do</span>
 . Include the engineers in the strategic work. You can frame the strategy as &quot;these are your ideas; I&apos;m just going to help put them together so the rest of the company can see the importance of our work.&quot;</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">They think you&apos;re currently underperforming as a PM.</span>
 Address those issues first. You might put in a few extra hours to create a light strategy without taking time away from your team.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">They want a project manager, not a product manager.</span>
 This is a tricky situation. Work with your manager to align on expectations. Early on in your career this can still be a great opportunity, but you might need to look for other roles to continue growing.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Remember that strategy is an important piece of being an effective PM, and it&apos;s important that you prioritize it appropriately.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor428"></a>
 Consider quick approaches</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Creating a strategy usually doesn&apos;t take as long as many people fear.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here are some quick approaches that can work well when you have a small area that isn&apos;t too controversial or mission-critical:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Draft and Feedback</span>
 : Jot down a quick draft of the three strategy components and share that draft with your teammates. Having something in writing gives people something concrete to give feedback on and gets the ball rolling. If you keep it intentionally short and unpolished, you can avoid the situation where people wish they were looped in earlier.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Full-Day or Half-Day Strategy Retreat</span>
 : Gather teammates and stakeholders together to share ideas and discuss direction.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">30% Time</span>
 : Over one-to-three weeks, spend a third of your time researching and brainstorming. At that point, you&apos;ll have one or more ideas for possible directions and can decide how much more time to invest.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The next section covers the approach for larger areas that are more critical or more controversial.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor429"></a>
 Creating a large strategy</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When your team is small, you can often get by with drafting a strategy alone and then asking the team for feedback.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When the stakes get higher, the team gets bigger, or controversy builds, then it&apos;s important to create the strategy collaboratively.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here is a process for creating strategies from Asana&apos;s Head of Product, Alex Hood.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor430"></a>
 Step 1: Dive into lots of input</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-3">A strategy should not be designed in a vacuum.</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-3">Review the strategies and vision that this strategy will contribute to (for example, the company strategy). Does this strategy build upon or enhance the declared product strategy? At a minimum, it should tie to it directly. Better, it accelerates the overall product strategy.</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-3">Review pertinent insights from customers, tests run, competitive analysis, or any other sources. Go broad on getting inputs without burning too much time upfront.</span>
</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor431"></a>
 Step 2: Kick it off</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The kickoff sets the tone for the process. People might be nervous about creating a new strategy, but you can set them at ease.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-3">Have the right stakeholders at the meeting. You can create a DACI chart</span>
 <a href="text00032.html#_idTextAnchor583">
<span class="CharOverride-3">(see Step 2: Clarify the decision-maker and other roles in Chapter</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-3">21</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-3">)</span>
</a>
 <span class="CharOverride-3">. Share summaries of what you learned by reviewing new insights. Share how this new strategy will layer into existing higher-level visions or strategies so that no one thinks you are reinventing the wheel. People will be more supportive of strategy work that enhances prior art.</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Some questions to ask at the kickoff include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">What strategic questions are top of mind?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Are there examples of decisions where a better strategy would have helped?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Is there anything timely coming up related to the strategy (e.g., an important milestone or decision)?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">What parts of the strategy would each person like to get involved with?</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-3">Establish a timeline with key objectives and check-ins.</span>
</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor432"></a>
 Step 3: Checkpoint 1—key hypotheses</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A product strategy entails several key hypotheses—the assumptions or assertions that drive your product decisions. For example, you might have hypotheses around a build-versus-buy decision, pricing strategy, market research, data analysis, or engineering framework.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-3">Split these hypotheses into different workstreams (with owners and participants) so that individual teams can tackle them and report back.</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-3">At the first checkpoint, each team can present their hypothesis and the reasons they believe it. Then, come up with the most important set of key questions that are needed to validate or invalidate these hypotheses and discuss a plan how you&apos;ll figure out the answers. Keep your list small (two to seven at most). In your check-in, ask stakeholders for their thoughts and ensure people agree that you&apos;re asking the right questions.</span>
</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor433"></a>
 Step 4: Checkpoint 2—draft strategies/bets</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-3">Once teams have researched each workstream, create a draft of the overarching strategies. For example, a hypothesis around freemium pricing might get solidified into a strategy to give away basic photo editing for free but charge for advanced photo filters.</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-3">Write down strong assertions. Take a stand and be controversial. Come up with several candidates for strategies. Get people to co-create, co-edit, break down, and build them up together.</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-3">As a final step, create an exercise where you winnow down the list. For example, you can let people vote on their top 30% favorite strategies. Set the context though—it isn&apos;t a democracy; their votes are input into your decision.</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Beyond the core set of people working on the strategy, you&apos;ll also want to get feedback from the larger group of people who will be affected. Ask each stakeholder to be a representative of their team and to check with their team for feedback and buy-in. You don&apos;t want to get to the end of the process and learn that the engineering lead didn&apos;t let any other engineers know what was going on.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor434"></a>
 Step 5: Checkpoint 3—declare</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-3">At the final checkpoint, partner with the stakeholders to declare your final strategies. This is the time to ensure the strategies are well-understood and to finalize the wording.</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-3">Then, use the balance of your time to determine the &quot;so what?&quot;. Come in with a list of what the team might/will do differently because of these pointed strategic decisions. What new work will be started? Use your final check-in to declare and begin execution so that your strategies get traction at their first moment of inception. Starting right away will reassure the team that the effort they put into creating the strategy will have meaning, and it allows you to jump start initiatives without a pause.</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You may have a set of people who need to review and approve the new strategy who might not have been involved in the process until this point. At the very least, this usually includes your manager and your manager&apos;s manager, but could consist of a broader executive committee. They can be included in this checkpoint, or you can present your strategy to them after it.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor435"></a>
 Step 6: Create artifacts</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-3">Even though your team might have started new work based on the strategy, the strategy isn&apos;t finished until it is thoroughly communicated.</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-3">Create and roll out a communication strategy for up, down, and across the organization. Create strong visuals, decks, recordings, or documents that people can learn from and refer to. Repeat yourself often and make sure that everyone who should care about the strategy hears about it more than once.</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-3">These artifacts help you communicate efficiently in the future. They&apos;ll be included in every team&apos;s deliverables or brainstorming sessions that impacts your work. Design them to be referenced and reused.</span>
</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor436"></a>
 Step 7: Create a scoreboard</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-3">Broadcast how you&apos;ll be doing and how you&apos;ll be keeping score and keep it up to date. This serves as a role model for accountability.</span>

 Help! Executives want a say in the strategy, but they won&apos;t join my meetings.</p>
<p class="BODY_Sidebar" style=";color:black;">Executives are busy people (see <a style=";color:black;" href="text00037.html#_idTextAnchor686">&quot;Working with executives&quot; in Chapter 26</a>
 ) and they don&apos;t always find large team meetings to be good uses of their time. Instead, you can give them dedicated time to share their thoughts.</p>
<p class="BODY_Sidebar" style=";color:black;">Some executives are willing to give you a &quot;brain dump&quot; of all of their strategic thoughts before you get started. You can ask them over email, set up a meeting, or join their office hours.</p>
<p class="BODY_Sidebar" style=";color:black;">Other executives prefer to give feedback on a draft of your strategy. This approach often works better because important disagreements can hide behind unspoken assumptions. When you take this approach, you&apos;ll need to balance how complete the draft is when you share it against how much of your team&apos;s work could be wasted if the executive gives feedback that sends you back to the drawing board.</p>
<p class="BODY_Sidebar" style=";color:black;">Send the draft in advance, and then set up a 1:1 meeting. Some executives will respond to the draft in writing to avoid the meeting, and that&apos;s a fine outcome.</p>

 Share your strategy and evangelize it</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">After your strategy is approved, your job is only about half-way done. You need to come up with a communication plan to share and continually reinforce the strategy. You need to advocate for the strategy and get people excited about it.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The tech community often calls this kind of advocacy &quot;evangelism&quot; because you&apos;re &quot;preaching&quot; about your idea.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Some ideas for communicating the strategy and getting people excited about it include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Create an infomercial-like vision presentation.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Share your vision and strategy at the team meeting.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Present your vision to the company at an all-hands meeting.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Put up posters with key strategic points or printouts from the vision.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">In speaking and writing, explicitly describe how decisions and feedback connect to the strategy.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Answer people&apos;s questions by referring them back to the applicable part of the strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">PMs and product leaders almost always underestimate how much they need to remind people of the strategy. If you think you&apos;ve communicated the strategy enough, try randomly quizzing some team members on it; you might be surprised at how much work it takes to make the strategy stick. If you feel like you&apos;re constantly repeating yourself, you&apos;re probably on the right track!</p>

 Key Takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Strategy is more important than feature work</span>
 : It doesn&apos;t matter how great your feature is if the product fails. It&apos;s no use for your team to work really hard if they&apos;re headed in the wrong direction. Many teams waste years on incremental work that doesn&apos;t make a big impact. If your team doesn&apos;t have a good strategy, creating one should be your top priority.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">A complete product strategy has a vision, framework, and roadmap</span>
 : They work together to paint a picture of where you&apos;re heading, why you&apos;re going there, and how you&apos;ll get there. The vision inspires people. The framework explains the details. The roadmap shows what it will take to deliver.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Communicate your strategy until it sticks</span>
 : It takes a lot of communication and repetition to help people understand and remember the strategy. Don&apos;t assume people remember the relevant pieces of the strategy. Reference the key parts of the strategy in your everyday conversations with your team.</li>
</ul>
