<span class="AllCaps-Bold _idGenCharOverride-1">The good thing</span>
 about the Google <a id="_idIndexMarker115"></a>
 APM program was that I got to take on opportunities outside of my comfort zone. The bad thing was that, well, I <span class="CharOverride-1">had</span>
 to take on opportunities outside of my comfort zone.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">And so was the case with my upcoming rotation. The Search team had a reputation for requiring strong analytical skills—skills that I wasn&apos;t so sure I had. I&apos;d struggled with analytical interview questions in the past. In fact, I was still feeling a little burned by a recent consulting interview where I was asked to pull new revenue opportunities out of a stack of spreadsheets. Let&apos;s just say that did not go well.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Still, I proceeded with the rotation. The only failure is the failure to try, right? Let&apos;s hope!</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It turns out that my fears were unfounded. Not only did I excel on the Search team, I became known specifically <span class="CharOverride-1">for</span>
 my analytical skills. It wasn&apos;t that I became a spreadsheets whiz, or that I could immediately extract meaning from numbers.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Rather, it was my tenacity and pursuit of <span class="CharOverride-1">understanding</span>
 . I followed my curiosity and never rested until I had a firm mental model of a program. I browsed thousands of random search queries to see where we should have been showing images, and then developed a framework for understanding why and how. I worked with diary studies to figure out what people really wanted when they searched for restaurants. I double checked the accuracy of hundreds of local listings once I realized that, even when the web address was correct, the phone number or physical address could be wrong.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Creating these mental models wasn&apos;t always a quick or solo activity; it was a process, often team-wide. At Asana, I created giant spreadsheets laying out the tradeoffs of each solution, and often they felt like a mess at first. But diligently, and with my teammates&apos; help, I&apos;d bring order to these spreadsheets, distilling them down to their deciding factors.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">Analytical skills aren&apos;t about sudden strokes of genius—bursts of insight—when faced with a problem, they&apos;re not about solving math equations in your head, and they definitely aren&apos;t about PMs blazing into the room to conquer the problem. Rather, they&apos;re about structured <a id="_idIndexMarker116"></a>
 problem solving.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Great PMs have these skills, and know how to use them effectively. They detect when their team is stuck, clear away the noise, ask the right questions, come up with a framework for decision-making, gather the information to apply this structure, and drive good decisions. This is what analytical problem solving is all about.</p>

<p class="BODY_Sidebar-Heading" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor147" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Bringing Clarity to Ambiguity</p>
<p class="BODY_Sidebar" style=";color:black;">French or German? Asana was locked in a contentious debate over which language to pick for its first translation. Does it look at the number of speakers worldwide? Or within its user base? Or perhaps where it wants to grow the most?</p>
<p class="BODY_Sidebar" style=";color:black;">Lili Rachowin, a PM Lead at Asana, took charge of the decision-making process. She showed up to the hour-long review with a table of possible considerations—all the expected facts and numbers, along with some new items we hadn&apos;t considered. She argued that, with this being the <span class="CharOverride-1" style=";color:black;">first</span>
 translation, the most important factor was the willingness among the respective customer base to tolerate translation mistakes. The team hadn&apos;t thought of that, but agreed. Her proposal was approved on the spot.</p>
<p class="BODY_Sidebar" style=";color:black;">Rachowin brought clarity to the ambiguous problem.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Product managers continuously face ambiguous problems. They must learn to recognize when they have an ambiguous problem and how to apply structure to it. Without this skill, they might try to solve problems based on their own intuition, or push these problems onto other people because they feel stuck.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Consider these ambiguous problems:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Should we delay the launch to include new features or to polish the product?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Which metrics should we be trying to improve?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Which user problem should we focus on?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">How can we increase revenue?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">How can we increase the usage of this feature?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Do we build our own solution or should we buy one?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Why did the graphs show a drop on a particular day?</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">At a high level, these and other ambiguous problem break down into two core types:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Exploratory problems:</span>
 We have a question or problem, and we don&apos;t have a good idea of the potential answers. &quot;How can we improve revenue?&quot;</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Decision-making problems:</span>
 We have an idea of what the potential solutions could be, but we don&apos;t know which one is the best. &quot;Which of these features should we launch first?&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Let&apos;s consider them both.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor148"></a>
 Exploratory problems</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Although exploratory problems are, by definition, wide open, you can still apply structure. Structured brainstorming can help.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Think of a few ways to slice up the problem space, and then brainstorm solutions inside each slice. As a PM, it&apos;s usually your responsibility to set up the structure. You can then bring more people into the loop and let them share their thoughts on the current slices, add additional slices, or offer any other relevant ideas.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">For example, with the, &quot;How can we improve revenue?&quot; problem, here are a few slices:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">New versus existing customers:</span>
 Consider how to increase the number of paying customers versus how to encourage existing customers to pay more.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Size of bet:</span>
 Consider what small optimizations and big new initiatives you could make.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Revenue stream:</span>
 Consider how to increase subscription revenue versus how to increase advertising revenue.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Customer type:</span>
 Consider revenue improvements for each persona or user profile.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">For the question, &quot;Why did our metrics drop all of a sudden on this day?&quot; here are a few ways to drill down:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Internal versus external changes:</span>
 Did we do something such as launching a feature or changing our <a id="_idIndexMarker117"></a>
 ad spend? Or did something in the external world happen, such as an international holiday or a competitor announcing a new product?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Geographically:</span>
 Did we see a change in different countries?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Product line/product area:</span>
 Did we see a drop across all of our products (or all parts of our product), or was it localized?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Funnel:</span>
 Was the drop in only one part of the funnel?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Source:</span>
 Did we see a drop coming from a particular referral source?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Customer type:</span>
 Was a particular type of customer affected more than others?</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Sometimes, simply brainstorming the slices will solve the problem. For example, in the metrics question, you can look at each slice and, eventually, you&apos;ll find the culprit. For the other cases, you&apos;ve just transformed your exploratory problem into a decision-making problem.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor149"></a>
 Decision-making problems</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Once you&apos;ve got some options for solutions, you have a decision-making problem. As with exploratory problems, you want to try a few different ways of structuring the problem, and then evaluate which method seems the most helpful.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">The goal with ambiguous decision-making problems is to simplify the problem down to the core, important tradeoffs.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The main issue with an ambiguous problem is usually information overload. There are so many potential facts and tradeoffs that it&apos;s difficult to figure out what really matters.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">One approach is to structure the options in a continuum across categories. You can then evaluate the decision at the category level rather than the individual solution level.</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Low risk versus high risk</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Low investment versus high investment</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Short-term benefit versus long-term benefit</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Growth focused versus revenue-focused</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Build versus buy</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">… or any problem-specific categorization</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you just have two options, this approach will often illuminate a third, middle option that you might have missed.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">For more approaches to structuring problems, see <a href="text00011.html#_idTextAnchor159">&quot;Concepts and Frameworks&quot; in Chapter 6</a>
 .</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor150"></a>
 Look into the data yourself</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Great PMs are willing to get their hands dirty. They want to see the raw data for themselves. And the better their analytical skills are, the more likely they&apos;ll be able to spot something for themselves that other people missed. That&apos;s why great PMs don&apos;t delegate fact gathering to other people; they want to do this themselves.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A year before Lili Rachowin <a href="text00011.html#_idTextAnchor145">(see Identify and structure ambiguous problems in Chapter 6)</a>
 solved the problem of which language to launch first, she solved another problem by looking at the data herself. She had stepped in as the PM of a product as it was getting ready to launch. Nearly a dozen people were stuck arguing over the launch date for weeks. She opened up a spreadsheet, walked over to the finance department, and calculated how much money was being lost every week the launch was delayed. When people saw the results, the disagreements stopped.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor151"></a>
 Help <a id="_idIndexMarker118"></a>
 triage and reproduce <a id="_idIndexMarker119"></a>
 bugs</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Once your product is launched, bug reports will start coming in. Some will indicate severe issues and others will be mild. Some impact many users and others just a few. Some will be easy to fix and others require more work. For some, the problem will be immediately obvious and others will be harder to diagnose.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As a PM, you&apos;ll consider all of these factors and decide what to do with the bug. Some of the bugs wouldn&apos;t be worth the time they would take to fix, and so you close them as &quot;won&apos;t fix.&quot; Many of them will be slotted in to be worked on in the coming weeks or months. For the worst ones, you might ask an engineer to stop what they&apos;re working on and fix it. This process of prioritizing which bugs to fix and how quickly to fix them is called &quot;bug triage.&quot;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">To prioritize bugs, consider the following factors:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Damage to users:</span>
 Can this bug cause any large or lasting damage to users? Does it expose them to a security or privacy issue? Could they lose data?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Damage to company:</span>
 Can this bug cause any large or lasting damage to the company? Could it damage the company&apos;s reputation severely?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Impact on metrics:</span>
 Does this bug have a large impact on key company metrics? Does it hurt costs or revenue? Does it hurt activation, adoption, revenue, <a id="_idIndexMarker120"></a>
 retention, or referrals? Is it causing a large number of support tickets?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Scale of impact:</span>
 How many users are affected by the bug or exposed to the bug? Does the bug disproportionately affect important customers (e.g., paying customers or large customers)? Will more or fewer users be affected in the future?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Workarounds:</span>
 Are there workarounds? Would a user discover the workaround on their own?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Ease of fixing:</span>
 Is the bug easy to fix? How long would it take to fix?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Now vs. later:</span>
 Is it timely to fix the bug now? Is it cheaper to fix the bug now than it would be later? Is there marketing planned around that part of the product?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Cost/benefit relative to other work:</span>
 How does the cost and benefit of fixing the bug compare to the cost and benefit of focusing on new feature work?</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As part of the triage process, a good PM takes a first pass at the bugs to understand them, clarify them, and resolve them as quickly as possible. This is where analytical problem solving can come into play.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Perhaps you&apos;ve seen a similar bug before and you have a guess about what the problem is and how the user can resolve it (for example, by turning off a particular chrome extension or requesting a new password). Otherwise, you can try to reproduce the bug and narrow down the circumstances in which it occurs (for example, only on one browser, or only when your shopping cart is empty). Depending on your technical skill, you might even look at logs to identify the error or crash.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The more detailed and specific you can get the steps to reproduce the problem, the faster the engineer will be able to fix it.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor152"></a>
 Systems thinking <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Imagine you&apos;re working on a new type of user-generated content, and an engineer asks you if it&apos;s critical for this type of content to show up in search. A few days can be saved if you skip it.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This might sound like a simple prioritization decision, but the implications can be much larger. The engineer didn&apos;t mention this, but if you say no to search, the feature will be built in an entirely different way that makes it much more expensive to add search later on. It also won&apos;t let the content show up in any dashboards or pick up any premium functionality. In an ideal world, the engineer would have explained the repercussions of the decision, but in this case, they wrongly assumed you already knew them.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">Systems thinking is the skill needed to see how different parts of a system (like a product or company) connect to each other, to ask the right questions, and to make decisions that account for how those interconnected parts will be affected.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">People who are strong at systems thinking will play out scenarios in their minds to see all of the repercussions, and then adjust plans to optimize for overall success.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Some types of interconnectedness to think about can be found below:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Feedback loops:</span>
 Will the results of this also act as inputs in the next round?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Cannibalization:</span>
 If one product is successful, will it decrease the usage of another?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Funnel stages:</span>
 If you widened the top of the funnel to bring in more signups, could those users behave differently later in the funnel?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Product components and functionality:</span>
 What impact does this new functionality have on other components such as search, notifications, permissions, or onboarding? Are there implementation choices that affect what ‘nice-to-have&apos; behaviors you&apos;ll get for free?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Incentives</span>
 : Does success in one part of the product change user behaviors elsewhere?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">UI components:</span>
 Will changes in this one place work everywhere the component is used?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Platforms:</span>
 Does this new functionality work the same on mobile, on desktop, and via the developer API?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Flexibility:</span>
 What changes become easier or more challenging in the future? Are you locking yourself in to certain decisions?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Resource requirements:</span>
 Will this cause scalability issues on the backend or for customer support?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">User life cycle:</span>
 If you make a change, such as giving new users unlimited space, what impact will that have in the long run?</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If this is an area where you need to improve, the best way is to get as many examples as possible. Ask a mentor or a coach to point out opportunities where you could have used more systems thinking.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Improving your systems-level thinking often means deepening your understanding of the underlying infrastructure—for example, by talking to the engineers on the infrastructure team. Ask questions about the options and their implications. Draw diagrams or create visual models to help you understand how everything connects. That will help you recognize the cases where product decisions seemed straightforward but actually have important side effects. While you&apos;re building up your understanding, you can create a safety net by specifically asking about the repercussions of your choices.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Another approach to systems thinking is to improve your ability to learn from past experiences. Rather than predicting all the things that might possibly happen in an interconnected system, you can keep checklists of the mistakes you and your teammates have made in the past and scan through them when building a new feature. You can sit in on experiment analysis meetings and read blog posts from other PMs to build up your internal library of possibilities to consider.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor153" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Growth practices</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor154"></a>
 Be curious: predict and explore</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Curiosity is a key element of problem-solving; not only does it help you notice the problems, but also guides you in figuring out the details that will help you solve them.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Start by predicting what you expect:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">If you&apos;re about to look at experiment results, make a quick estimation of what you think the numbers might be.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">If you&apos;re about to attend a meeting, try to guess what each person will say.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">If you&apos;re about to go to a training session, hypothesize what the advice will be.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This will help you notice when something is interesting and unexpected.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">If you don&apos;t make these predictions in advance, your brain could trick you into thinking that the answer was exactly what you expected. It&apos;s easy for &quot;that makes sense&quot; to feel like &quot;that was expected,&quot; after the fact.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Once you notice something unexpected, take some time to explore it. Draft some questions and seek to answer them. This is where you&apos;ll start to expand your knowledge, which will help with future problem-solving.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor155"></a>
 Don&apos;t just point out problems</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Some PMs take &quot;constructive criticism&quot; a little too far. This isn&apos;t necessarily out of cruelty. Sometimes it&apos;s because they take great pride in their ability to identify problems, to the point that they believe they&apos;re being helpful by pointing out everything that could possibly go wrong (particularly with other people&apos;s work). Needless to say, this is the wrong approach.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">While it&apos;s important to be aware of problems, PMs need to find solutions to overcome these problems and find a way to keep teams moving forward. Also, remember that you don&apos;t get credit for having the &quot;right&quot; solution if you&apos;re not able to convince people to adopt it. This largely involves a shift in your mindset.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">Instead of assigning value to the problems you spotted, assign value to the good outcomes you drove. It&apos;s easy and not especially valuable to say, &quot;Here are all the reasons that won&apos;t work.&quot; It&apos;s harder but much more useful to say, &quot;I can find a way to make that work.&quot;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It&apos;s important to note that once you advance into leadership positions and are responsible for reviewing other people&apos;s work, this advice flips. You might just want to point out problems so that you encourage teams to take ownership over finding their own solutions.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor156"></a>
 Articulate your frameworks <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Frameworks are a product manager&apos;s secret weapon. You&apos;re already creating and using frameworks—they&apos;re just the logic you&apos;re using to make decisions—but you might not be articulating them.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If I were to ask you why you ordered your team&apos;s roadmap in a particular way, or why you made a specific product decision, you could think about it and then give me an answer. Perhaps you only considered one factor, like what the engineers wanted most, or you might be using a different ad-hoc framework for each decision. Nonetheless, as imperfect as they are, you <span class="CharOverride-1">have</span>
 created frameworks.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">Articulating your frameworks is important because it shows people the logic and consistency behind your decisions. Writing them down gives you something concrete to improve upon.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This leads to many benefits, including:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Building</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-2"><a id="_idIndexMarker121"></a>
</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-2">credibility:</span>
 You will build credibility because people will understand the knowledge and critical thinking behind your decisions. They&apos;ll have more trust that you&apos;re making the right calls because they will understand the context behind every decision you make.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Less team frustration:</span>
 Your teammates are likely to be less frustrated when new information comes in that changes a decision. If they are only aware of the decision change, they might think that you hadn&apos;t thought through your original decision adequately. But when they see that the framework is consistent, they can anticipate the kinds of changes that might come up, and have a better understanding of why the initial decision had to change.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">More constructive feedback:</span>
 You&apos;ll get more constructive feedback from people because they&apos;ll be able to spot missing information or incorrect assumptions within your frameworks.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Greater efficiency:</span>
 You will save time because your teammates can use your framework and answer some of their own questions rather than always having to come to you for answers. Sometimes, you&apos;ll even save time for yourself because you&apos;ll realize you can reuse a pre-existing framework rather than creating a new one from scratch.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Improved decision-making:</span>
 Your frameworks will improve as you articulate them. For example, you might be thinking that your new team needs an easy project to get started. You then explain that it&apos;s useful to have a trial run of working together (PMs, engineers, and designers) without needing a lot of executive buy-in, both to get to know each other and to learn the new codebase. All of these extra details help narrow down what kind of &quot;simple&quot; project is best. You might not have thought of them if you didn&apos;t take the time to articulate your framework.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here&apos;s an easy way to articulate your framework: Whenever someone asks for your opinion or a decision, instead of just sharing it, also include the factors that would lead you to a different decision. For example, if someone asks which privacy setting should be the default, you could say:</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">We should set the default to share full profile information because this feature is only available in our enterprise tier and profile information is not sensitive within a company.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you later on decide to move the feature to another tier, or you learn that profile information <span class="CharOverride-1">is</span>
 sensitive within a company, your team will understand why the decision changed.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In addition to communicating your own frameworks, you&apos;ll also want to identify the frameworks others are using. You can try to reverse engineer their frameworks or ask them directly how they&apos;re making decisions. This will sharpen your skill and expand your repertoire of possible problem-solving approaches.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor157"></a>
 Optimize across products and over the long term <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Consider this scenario: Your company offers a suite of products, and you are lead PM for one of them. Each product in this suite offers a consistent in-product dashboard, but you have an idea for a special dashboard that would be even better suited for your product. Should you do it?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Sometimes, yes. But proceed with caution. That mindset of &quot;even better for <span class="CharOverride-1">your</span>
 product&quot; can be problematic. You need to think about what&apos;s best for the company, not just your product. Will people get confused by an inconsistent dashboard? Could it hurt the sales motion to have an outlier?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You also need to think long term. Who will maintain this &quot;special&quot; dashboard? Will it take longer to ramp up new teammates if your product works differently?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It is certainly normal for a junior PM to optimize around just their product. However, as they get more experience, they need to expand their perspective to optimize across <span class="CharOverride-1">many</span>
 products—including those that aren&apos;t &quot;under&quot; them. They also need to take into consideration the future. What will be the best for the company, in the short and long term?</p>

 Visualize how it&apos;s built <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">One day, I saw a surprising bug: a user&apos;s notifications were getting archived as soon as they arrived. The on-call engineer looked into it and was perplexed; the notifications didn&apos;t appear to be marked as archived. I thought back to how the notification system was built and remembered that there were two ways to archive notifications—individually, and by pressing &quot;archive all.&quot; I suspected that the user&apos;s &quot;last archived&quot; date was somehow set to the future in our database. We looked, and that&apos;s exactly what had happened! We fixed the date and the problem was solved.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Problem-solving can often feel like a guessing game. How could you predict what decisions might have surprising side effects? How can you guess what&apos;s causing a bug? The most reliable way is to have a deep understanding of the underlying system and visualize building the solution yourself.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Familiarize yourself with what the records look like for the main objects in the database. What information is directly available on the record, what would need to be looked up separately, and what isn&apos;t there at all? The information that&apos;s directly available will be easy to use, while other information might be harder or slower to use. You might find all kinds of useful details precalculated and ready to use, for example, data on how active the user is or where they&apos;re located.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Learn about the components in the framework. This could involve UI components (such as color selectors or buttons) and infrastructure (such as Amazon&apos;s Elastic Search). Each component will be able to do some things easily, some things with more expensive customization, and some things not at all. If you can visualize which components you&apos;d use to build a feature, you can predict what strengths and limitations come with it.</p>

 Concepts and Frameworks</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor161"></a>
 The <a id="_idIndexMarker122"></a>
 2x2 matrix</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A 2x2 matrix is a very popular framework. It&apos;s incredibly simple, but works really well for evaluating options or organizing information.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A 2x2 is just a square divided into four quadrants, where each axis represents a dimension you care about. Potential solutions are slotted into the appropriate quadrant. The diagram highlights the tradeoffs and helps you uplevel the conversation from specific solutions to higher-level decision criteria. Sometimes a 2x2 even helps you find a &quot;best of both worlds&quot; solution.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Let&apos;s say your product is an online art gallery, and you want to make it easier for people to find art they might like. The designer comes up with a beautiful design with nine preset categories (contemporary, pop-art, impressionism...), each of which leads to a themed category page. The engineer feels that predefined categories are too limiting and wants to implement search across the comments on each piece of work in order to be more flexible and extensible. The designer pushes back, saying more users will benefit from browsing a list of recognizable categories than if they needed to think of their own search terms.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you pull away from the specific solutions, then fundamentally, your decision criteria is around this: Do you want browsable or searchable? Do you want something more limited or something extensible?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You can lay these criteria and options out in a 2x2 to make the problem easier to reason about.</p>

 Red/yellow/green tables</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you have three or more decision-making criteria, you can create a table where the columns are the criteria and the rows are the options. The squares are filled in red, yellow, or green (or checks and x&apos;s, if you don&apos;t have colors), depending how well each option does on the category. You might be able to see that only one option has no red squares, or that every option that&apos;s good on cost is bad on long-term benefit.</p>

 Decision tree</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When you have a complex problem, diagramming the problem via a decision tree can be useful. Each node in the tree represents a question, and the branches represent possible answers. This helps people understand your thought process and ensures that you&apos;ve planned ahead for different possibilities.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In text, you can use a bulleted list with indentation to represent the tree:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">If the A/B test result is...<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-2">Positive<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-2">If there are customer complaints…<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-2">Interview customers and iterate</li>

 Eigenquestions</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When Shishir Mehrotra, now co-founder and CEO of Coda, was a PM at YouTube, there was intense debate that wasn&apos;t getting anywhere. The engineers wanted to link out to other websites when the user searched for TV shows that weren&apos;t available on YouTube. The business people disagreed. Should they link out or not?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As he searched for ways to solve the problem, Mehrotra realized that framing the debate around a different question could help. A few weeks earlier, he&apos;d sat in as an observer on a product review of Google Product Search, and heard the executives discussing product choices in terms of consistency vs. comprehensiveness. He realized that framing might cross-apply to his product as well.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">At the next leadership team off-site, he kicked off a discussion with a new question: would the online video market be one that rewarded consistency or comprehensiveness? Unlike the earlier question, this new question could be resolved. After much discussion, they settled it; consistency was more important than comprehensiveness.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Surprisingly, not only did this decision answer the original question, it also resolved several other issues that hadn&apos;t seemed related previously. They ultimately decided that they would not link outside of YouTube for search results. They also removed the ability for creators to opt content out of different devices and removed all third-party embed players. They even decided to take back control of the YouTube iOS app from Apple.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Mehrotra named this kind of root question an &quot;eigenquestion,&quot; a question whose answer likely answers subsequent questions as well.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-001-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00011.html#endnote-001">1</a>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">To use the eigenquestion methodology, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Diagram your questions and options with your team. Spend extra time making sure you&apos;ve gotten all of the important questions out. Look outside to other teams or industries for alternate framings.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Walk through each question and ask, &quot;If we decided this, which other questions would be answered?&quot; Find the question that answers the most other questions. This is your eigenquestion.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">With your team, list the range of options that could answer the eigenquestion, and identify the pros and cons of each one.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Align on a decision. Check in with your teammates on how they feel about the options. If people are uncomfortable with your proposed option, take the time to fully understand why.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Commit and determine accountability. Make sure you know who is responsible for communicating the decision and making it happen.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It may feel like this methodology is a long, even burdensome, process, but it can help you make more robust decisions that save time in the long term. If you start with the eigenquestion, you will not only answer that question, you&apos;ll answer a dozen subsequent questions as well.</p>

 Five Whys</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">&quot;Five Whys&quot; is a useful framework to conduct a <a id="_idIndexMarker127"></a>
 retrospective analysis of a problem. If you practice Five Whys across a range of problems, you&apos;ll hone your problem-solving skills, and learn to go beneath surface factors to identify the root cause.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-002-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00011.html#endnote-002">2</a>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You can run a Five Whys for many different problems. For example, site downtime, missed OKRs, failed launches, cross-functional collaboration issues, or any other issue that&apos;s causing problems or frustration. The problem is usually a brief statement like, &quot;The site was down for three hours,&quot; &quot;the sales team wasn&apos;t told that the launch was happening this week,&quot; or &quot;we missed the OKR to raise adoption by 30%.&quot;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">To run a Five Whys:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Schedule time with the people involved in the problem.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Explain that the goal is to learn about deeper systemic issues, and not to assign blame.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Create a detailed timeline of what happened. Timelines can be very illuminating as it gives people the full picture of what happened.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">State the problem and ask, &quot;Why did this problem happen?&quot; Write down all the first-level answers.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Go back to each first-level answer, and ask why it happened or any related questions around why the problem wasn&apos;t caught or fixed sooner. For example, if a developer submitted code that crashed, why wasn&apos;t it caught by test cases.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Keep going deeper until you feel like you&apos;ve uncovered the root cause. Often, a process failure is identified as the underlying issue.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Record the lessons learned and decide on appropriate action items to prevent similar problems in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Be careful not to overreact with your solutions. If a problem has only happened once, adding a heavy process to prevent it might be worse for your team than doing nothing.</p>

 Key Takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Lead your team through effective decision-making</span>
 : As a PM, you don&apos;t need to solve every problem yourself, but you <span class="CharOverride-1">do</span>
 play a key role in structuring the problem. When you frame a problem in a way that surfaces the underlying issues, your team will come up with better and more robust solutions.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Draw it out</span>
 : Tables and diagrams are surprisingly helpful for analyzing problems. If you&apos;re stuck, try organizing the pros and cons in a few different formats until you find one that resonates.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Pay attention to the whole system</span>
 : Most interesting problems have interconnected impact and require systems thinking. Make sure you understand the broader context. Don&apos;t oversimplify the problem into an isolated decision. Instead, make a list of possible repercussions and check your solutions against them.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Articulate your frameworks</span>
 : Share the thought process and structure behind your problem solving instead of just the solution. This helps people trust the solution you came to and enables them to make aligned decisions in the future.</li>
