 Tell me about you and your career path.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I work as a product discovery coach. That means I work with teams on making good decisions about what to build, through a focus on continuous discovery with things like interviewing regularly, rapid prototyping, and regularly experimenting.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As an undergraduate, I took design classes at Stanford and was exposed to human computer interaction (HCI). As a 22-year-old, I came into business believing that business was human-centered and that people cared about solving customer problems.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Out of college, I took a role as an interaction designer. My first title, technically, was application software developer, but I was hired because of my HCI background. That was my first introduction to a hybrid role.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The next job I had was a really pivotal point in my career. I was the tenth employee at a really early stage startup, which I discovered through Craigslist.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">I started as a frontend developer and designer and moved to a design and product management role. I came in and said I want to talk to customers and figure out what we should be doing. Our VP of product management was impressed and started bringing me into the executive meetings. I got firsthand exposure to the finances and was involved in M&amp;A conversations.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In my third company, I was hired as a director of UX, but within three weeks of joining the company, I realized they really needed product leadership. So, I became their director of product. I&apos;ve always blurred the roles between product UX and a bit of engineering.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">From there, most of the companies I worked with were early stage startups. I got a pretty good introduction to business and how startups work at a young age. By the time I was 30, I was already a VP of product. By the time I was 32, I was a startup CEO.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1139" style=";color:black;"></a>
 How did you become CEO?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Being a CEO was pivotal in a way that most people wouldn&apos;t think. I&apos;d joined the company as a director, nine months before the VP of product left. He helped me build a relationship with the CEO since I was doing strategic product and positioning work. So, when he left, I became the VP of product.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I joined the executive team and learned that it was really misaligned. Our head of sales wanted to go one way, I wanted to go another way, and our head of engineering wanted to go a third way.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I loved the work that we were doing, but it got to the point where I didn&apos;t want to work there anymore. I went to my CEO and I told him I needed to take an extended break. I traveled for six weeks and on my plane flight back, I wrote two or three pages of notes of what I thought had to change for me to want to keep working there. When I got back, I sat down with our CEO and just talked to him about it. He agreed and promoted me to be the VP of operations.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Only six months after that, the economy fell apart in 2008. Our entire business was falling apart, and I intended to tell the CEO that I was going to resign because we couldn&apos;t afford to pay both of us. And literally on that day, he pulled me aside and told me he was resigning and that he was going to recommend to the board that I take over.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1140" style=";color:black;"></a>
 What was it like to be a CEO?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The next two and a half years were easily the hardest years of my life, but also the most rewarding. I mean, I was miserable. It wasn&apos;t fun.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">People associate so much weight with that title, but I don&apos;t think they realize that it comes with a ton of gut-wrenching responsibility. You&apos;re responsible for people&apos;s paychecks. We were in a situation for six months where I didn&apos;t know if we could meet our next payroll.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">Also, some people think that as a CEO, they get to make all the decisions. That&apos;s not true. Bringing a team along is really hard. Managing a board is really hard and very political. People think that the boss has no boss. That&apos;s not true. The boss has many bosses. The politics involved in <a id="_idIndexMarker896"></a>
 venture capital is a nightmare.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">But, I also learned more in those two and a half years than any other time period in my career.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">At the end of the life of that company, I was really burnt out. I took 14 months off and then started consulting, because I wasn&apos;t ready for a job but I needed income.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1141" style=";color:black;"></a>
 What inspired you to become a product <a id="_idIndexMarker897" style=";color:black;"></a>
 coach?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">After consulting for a while, I took a job as head of product and design at another startup. I was only there for about 13 months when I realized that I couldn&apos;t do startups anymore. There was a lot of politics with the CEO and the board, and I saw the worst of the impacts of <a id="_idIndexMarker898"></a>
 venture capital. I&apos;ve seen board members who didn&apos;t think about what was best for the company and just thought about what was best for them individually as a shareholder. I saw board members who had fixed opinions and weren&apos;t open to strategic discussions.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I took some time to write down all the things I loved and all the things I didn&apos;t want. That really helped me see that, even though I love working on products, I didn&apos;t want to do the executive team alignment work. I also didn&apos;t like doing product work as an outsider because it creates a dependency between you and the company. And, I didn&apos;t want to be a crutch, preventing them from being on a path to being successful.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">I realized that I kept seeing the same problem at companies, which was that product teams just don&apos;t spend enough time with their customers, and they didn&apos;t know how to change. That&apos;s when I decided to focus on coaching full time.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I came up with the idea that I wouldn&apos;t do the strategic or research work for companies; I would teach them how to do it. Companies were still coming to me and asking me to do research. I took those consulting leads and turned them into hybrid consulting/coaching leads by saying I&apos;d do it if they sent a PM to do it with me and learn how to do it themselves the next time.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Eventually, I started writing very deliberately. I had already been blogging, but I very deliberately changed my writing to appeal to a head of product who knew they needed to develop the team but didn&apos;t have time. I started talking about the future of product management and what that future looks like. I wrote about the skills required and what people should be focusing on. That&apos;s when my blog shifted to be entirely around discovery and continuous discovery.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When I started writing, I started getting inbound coaching requests. The first email I got was a two sentence email that said &quot;You write about a lot of the things that my team struggles with. Will you coach us?&quot; That was from Hope Gurion, and now she&apos;s a big thought leader and consultant in the product space and our businesses have merged together.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1142" style=";color:black;"></a>
 How would a PM know if coaching would be a good path for them?</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">I like to make a distinction between coaching and training. Training has this expert/teacher model of &quot;I&apos;m going to teach you the way to do things,&quot; which I don&apos;t think works very well with coaching. The coaching model is more &quot;Let&apos;s co-create together what&apos;s going to work for you.&quot; There&apos;s a humility to coaching that&apos;s very different from teaching.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">To know if you&apos;d be good at coaching, it&apos;s a little bit of a gut check of how much you can set aside your <a id="_idIndexMarker899"></a>
 ego. The term &quot;servant leadership&quot; is becoming trendy, and a bit jargony, but I feel like the concept behind it is really good. If I&apos;m working with a product team, my role as a coach is to serve them in whatever way I can. That&apos;s very different from a traditional training mindset of &quot;I have my method that I&apos;m going to stamp onto you.&quot;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">With coaching, there are the skills of holding the space, naming things, asking powerful questions, and really helping the team find their way there rather than you leading them there.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Moving away from a product role, I do miss working with engineers. I miss creating something as a team. But, I treat my coaching curriculum like a product and I&apos;m getting to the point where I have collaborators on it.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A nice part of coaching is that you can exclude all of the things you don&apos;t like. I don&apos;t deal with a board. I don&apos;t deal with an executive team. I don&apos;t have salespeople. I just have an admin who supports me. My business is really simple, and it supports exactly how I want to work.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1143" style=";color:black;"></a>
 What advice would you give to a PM who wants to advance in their career?</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">Take some time to really figure out what you like and don&apos;t like. Don&apos;t just get stuck climbing the corporate ladder and going after more money and a bigger title.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I know it&apos;s easy for me to say because I&apos;ve been a CEO, but I&apos;ve had this experience a few times. It&apos;s really easy to think that you want something, but then you get that, and you realize it&apos;s not at all what you thought it was. Before you waste 20 years going after something you&apos;re not sure you want, talk to people in those roles. Try to get a really clear picture of what they look like. For example, I know so many heads of product that miss the product work.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">The other advice is—don&apos;t be afraid to create the role you want.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It&apos;s easier to do that as a consultant, but you can also do it at an organization. People who take initiative have way more ability to do that than they realize.</p>
