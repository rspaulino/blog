<p class="First-Paragraph---Main-Book">
<span class="AllCaps-Bold _idGenCharOverride-1">&quot;You&apos;re a product</span>
 manager? How many people do you manage?&quot; I&apos;d heard the question so many times that I had my answer down pat. &quot;I manage the <span class="CharOverride-1">product</span>
 , not the <span class="CharOverride-1">people</span>
 .&quot; I would reply.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Still, that question affected me. It subtly implied that managing people was the real marker of success. Was I on the wrong track? I loved my product and the impact I was having at Asana, but should I switch to one of the fast-growing companies with high turnover that made people into managers after a year or two? Was I a worse PM than my friends who&apos;d chosen that path?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I felt a lot of external pressure to move into people management quickly, but in retrospect, I&apos;m very glad I didn&apos;t give in. I did eventually move into people management, but the extra years I spent as an IC (individual contributor) were some of the most fun, impactful, and rewarding years of my career. As the company grew, becoming a people manager became the most impactful way for me to scale my impact—but the role does come with tradeoffs.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor702" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Do you really want to be a people manager?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When you&apos;re just starting out, it&apos;s easy to think that managers are &quot;in charge&quot;. And they are—to some extent. They do generally have some additional authority to make decisions, and to hire and—if needed—fire.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">But as they say: &quot;with great power comes great responsibility.&quot;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When you step into a management role, you become <span class="CharOverride-1">more</span>
 accountable to other people for the decisions you make. You have to appeal to your engineers, your reports, and to more senior management. Your reports don&apos;t magically obey you, and even if they did, leveraging your power over them usually backfires.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This is all to say that people management is a complex role—loved by some, but not all. Be cautious about whether you truly want to make this transition; it&apos;s so easy to get caught up in the &quot;prestige&quot; associated with it—and don&apos;t be afraid to exit if it’s not for you. But if it&apos;s the right fit, or you just want to try it out, go for it!</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor703"></a>
 Reasons you might not want to be a people manager</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor704"></a>
 People management can be emotionally draining</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The decisions you make as a people manager can weigh heavily on you. Unlike product decisions, it&apos;s no longer &quot;just software.&quot; You are responsible for people&apos;s livelihood now. You&apos;re responsible for judging people&apos;s performance and deciding who gets a raise and who doesn&apos;t. You might be in a situation where you need to fire someone.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">These are all extremely difficult decisions that matter. It&apos;s relatively easy to treat a failed A/B test as a learning experience, but it&apos;s much more difficult to think of failures with your reports that way.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor705"></a>
 People management can be isolating</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">People treat managers differently, especially if they didn&apos;t know the person before they became a manager. You might find that you&apos;re not welcomed into the team the same way an IC would be. You might not be invited to outside-of-work events, or if you are, people might be more reserved in the way they talk to you. This makes work less fun, especially if there aren&apos;t other managers you can bond with.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor706"></a>
 You can&apos;t be entirely honest</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As a people manager, you&apos;ll often learn secret or private information that you can&apos;t share with other people. For example, if you learn that someone will be leaving the company in a few weeks, you might need to reassign work without providing an explanation, or even hinting at the reason.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Sometimes you&apos;ll need to enforce a policy change you disagree with. As a manager, it&apos;s inappropriate to complain to your reports about the change; whether you agree with it or not, it will be your responsibility to roll it out successfully to your team. You can discuss your disagreement with your own manager, but to your team you&apos;ll need to support the company&apos;s decisions.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor707"></a>
 You need to get work done through other people</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">PMs already get work done through other people, but it&apos;s even more challenging when you need to rely on others to do work that you <span class="CharOverride-1">know</span>
 you could do yourself. Most of the time, you know you could do the work faster and better than the people on your team, but you need to hold back and coach them rather than just telling them what to do. You need to give them space to do things their own way and make their own mistakes.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor708"></a>
 You have to disappoint people</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Success as a manager isn&apos;t just about making the people who report to you happy. Your responsibility is to deliver excellent results and help the company succeed. Sometimes, what&apos;s best for the company isn&apos;t necessarily what&apos;s best for your reports. Sometimes what one report wants will conflict with another.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You might have to make tough calls about allocating people to projects or distributing <a id="_idIndexMarker530"></a>
 stretch opportunities. You&apos;ll need to evaluate people and tell them when they&apos;re not meeting expectations. You might not be able to give people the raises they want (or even the raises you want to give them). You might need to add processes that improve product quality but slow teams down.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor709"></a>
 You need to put in a lot of hours and have a lot of meetings</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When you&apos;re a PM, you get more and more efficient as you gain experience and improve your skills. Specs that used to take a week now take two hours. Some decisions take minutes instead of days. You catch usability problems immediately instead of after a usability test. Your work-life balance improves, and you can use the extra time to tackle new challenges.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">People management isn&apos;t quite as scalable in that way. Sure, you&apos;ll get faster at making decisions and more efficient at resolving prickly situations. But, no matter how good you get as a manager, you can&apos;t make a 30 minute weekly <a id="_idIndexMarker531"></a>
 1:1 meeting take less time—and you&apos;ll need to have one of those with each of the people who report to you. You&apos;ll need to attend other people&apos;s meetings to gain cross-company context and share what your team is doing. If your team is hiring, you&apos;ll spend hours each week interviewing candidates. A substantial portion of your calendar will be filled up with meetings that don&apos;t get faster as you improve. In some ways, the quality of your work is directly correlated with the amount of time you put in.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor710"></a>
 You are responsible for process</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Most PMs do not like process. They tend to prefer autonomy over rules. As a manager, you&apos;ll be responsible for setting up processes and getting your organization running smoothly. And, the higher you move up the <a id="_idIndexMarker532"></a>
 organizational hierarchy, the more that spearheading processes becomes a fundamental part of your job.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Some PMs are eager to move into management because they want to leave day-to-day execution behind. In reality, execution is still a major part of your job. You just shift from helping a single team execute well to ensuring several teams execute well.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor711"></a>
 <a id="_idIndexMarker533"></a>
 Recruiting becomes a big part of your job</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you grumble about how much time interviews take or you don&apos;t like talking to potential candidates, you might be disappointed to learn how much time managers put into recruiting. Some people love recruiting, but many do not.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">At a growing company, you&apos;ll probably spend at least eight hours per week on recruiting. People who are great at building their team might have coffee chats every day of the week. You spend a lot of time pitching candidates, most of whom don&apos;t work out. You might travel for job fairs or to speak at conferences, in the hopes of finding someone good.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor712"></a>
 You don&apos;t need to be a manager to <a id="_idIndexMarker534"></a>
 mentor people</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">People commonly say they want to become a manager because they love to mentor people. If you truly love to mentor people, you can do it without becoming a manager. In fact, many people hire leadership coaches who mentor them without a reporting structure.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In many ways, it&apos;s better to mentor people without being their manager. You&apos;ll be able to stay 100% focused on helping them grow without conflicting business interests. When you give feedback, it&apos;s easier to be supportive rather than judgmental.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you want the &quot;try before you buy&quot; experience of management, see if you can officially mentor an <a id="_idIndexMarker535"></a>
 intern or <a id="_idIndexMarker536"></a>
 APM. These mentorship relationships are a great way to help you decide if you might like being a manager. You&apos;ll usually be the person&apos;s main point of contact and will be responsible for helping create growth plans, giving performance feedback, and writing reviews.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">

</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor713"></a>
 Becoming a manager is not always the best way to advance your career</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In general, the company matters more than the role when it comes to advancing your career. If you don&apos;t want to be a manager, you can still advance in your career as a senior or principal PM. You can also consider coaching, consulting, and venture capital roles.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When you&apos;re at a great company you can learn best practices from your coworkers and ship products that have a big impact. You&apos;ll often build a stronger reputation, which opens up more options for you in the future.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor714"></a>
 You don&apos;t need to become a manager to make a huge salary</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If salary is your top concern, you&apos;re generally better off taking an IC role at a big tech company than a manager role at a smaller company. Take a look at tools like <a id="_idIndexMarker537"></a>
 levels.fyi to see salary ranges at different companies.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor715"></a>
 Reasons you might want to be a people manager</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor716"></a>
 You can have a bigger impact</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">One of the main reasons to become a manager is that you can make a bigger impact with a team of people than you can by yourself.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Most products are built by teams of dozens or hundreds of engineers. To be responsible for a product of that size, you&apos;d need to be a manager, or even a manager of managers.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor717"></a>
 You have more strategic influence</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As a manager, you&apos;re responsible for setting the overarching vision and strategy to guide the teams under you.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Moreover, as a manager, you&apos;ll get to contribute to the strategies next to and above yours. You&apos;ll be invited to higher-level meetings where you can share your thoughts on the direction of the company. You&apos;ll be included in higher level decisions.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor718"></a>
 It expands your perspective</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When you&apos;ve never been a manager, their behavior can seem perplexing, or even incompetent. It can be hard to work with managers because you don&apos;t have a clear mental model of what they care about or how they make decisions.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Once you become a manager, you see the other side. You&apos;ll have experiences and gain context that helps you understand their perplexing behavior. When you face those same situations, you&apos;ll see the extra constraints, goals, and other information that make &quot;the right way&quot; not so right at all. That expanded perspective can help you make better decisions.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor719"></a>
 It can be very rewarding to support people and build a well-functioning team</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Management is fundamentally a people-oriented job. You support people and help them grow. You bring people together and find ways to make the most of their skills. You convince talented people to join your team. You look for opportunities to help your teams create better outcomes.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Building strong teams is important and impactful.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor720"></a>
 It takes time to build people management skills, so it helps to start early</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you&apos;ve already mentored an <a id="_idIndexMarker538"></a>
 intern or <a id="_idIndexMarker539"></a>
 APM and are confident that you want to be a manager someday, you might lean towards people management earlier in your career.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Unlike product skills, you don&apos;t get to exercise people management skills on a predictable timeline. People will need to be hired, fired, coached, and promoted on their own schedule. It takes years to build up a breadth of experiences. Over time, people management problems will feel like a routine part of your job, and you&apos;ll know how to handle them with confidence.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor721" style=";color:black;"></a>
 How to become a people manager</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There are three things that need to come together at the right time for you to become a people manager.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor722"></a>
 The organization has a need for a new manager</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Companies don&apos;t make people managers just to reward them for a job well done. They only add managers when they have people who need to be managed.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Joining a rapidly growing team increases your chances of becoming a manager quickly. Eventually they&apos;ll need more people to manage those PMs. Another opportunity occurs when an existing manager departs, but you probably can&apos;t predict when that will happen.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor723"></a>
 You are senior enough and performing well enough</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Most companies have a minimum level where people become eligible to be a manager. Once you reach that level, you also need to be a top performer.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The exact bar for becoming a manager will be context dependent. If the PM team desperately needs a new manager, the bar could be lower. If there are very senior IC PMs on the team, the bar may be higher.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A common frustration among managers is when PMs who don&apos;t hit the bar want to become people managers. It&apos;s frustrating because those PMs often ignore feedback on how they need to improve, based on the mistaken assumption that PM skills aren&apos;t important for managers.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">For example, a PM might say they don&apos;t need to improve their execution skills because they&apos;ll just have a direct report handle the execution for them. That&apos;s not a correct assumption. Managers require even stronger execution skills than IC PMs because they need to orchestrate delivery across several product teams and manage their increased workload.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Managers continue to use product, execution, strategic, and leadership skills once they have direct reports. At many companies, front-line managers still directly PM a feature team, in addition to their new management responsibilities. If one of their direct reports is out on leave, the manager will be expected to step in. Managers also use higher-level versions of those skills to drive success across all of the teams that report to them. Moreover, if a PM isn&apos;t excelling in their role, there&apos;s little reason to trust that they could teach others to excel.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor724"></a>
 Leadership thinks you would be interested in (and good at) people management</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You shouldn&apos;t simply assume that your manager will notice your great work and reward you with a management role. Instead, diplomatically let your manager know that you&apos;re interested in becoming a people manager and ask if you have any skill gaps you should work on filling.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Diplomacy matters here. You don&apos;t want to irritate the person you&apos;ll need as your advocate. An easy approach is to frame the conversation with your manager as future-looking: &quot;I&apos;d love to become a people manager eventually. What skills do I need to develop so I&apos;ll be ready when the opportunity arises? Can we brainstorm on some ways for me to build those skills?&quot; Don&apos;t turn the conversation into an argument about how you think you do have those skills.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You may also want to have this conversation with your manager&apos;s peers. They&apos;ll have a more impartial perspective than your manager. By asking them for <a id="_idIndexMarker540"></a>
 mentorship and acting on their suggestions, you&apos;ll be strengthening your relationship and turning them into advocates.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here are a few ways to show you might be a good manager:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Mentor</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-2"><a id="_idIndexMarker541"></a>
</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-2">interns and</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-2"><a id="_idIndexMarker542"></a>
</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-2">APMs</span>
 . Treat it as an interview for management. Prioritize your reports, coach them, advocate for them, and ensure that they would be happy to be mentored by you again. If they do have performance problems, be sure to partner with your manager on the issues.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Earn the respect of other PMs</span>
 . When leadership is picking who will become the next manager, they&apos;ll pay attention to which person other PMs would be willing to report to.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Earn the respect of your manager&apos;s peers and other leaders at the company</span>
 . Whether a promotion decision lies ultimately with your manager or a committee, the opinion of other leaders matters. If they don&apos;t want to work with you, they could block your promotion.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Resolve conflicts on your own</span>
 . Managers often need to help their reports resolve conflicts. The best way to show you have this skill is to resolve your own conflicts without needing assistance.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you&apos;re hesitant to introduce this conversation to your manager or manager&apos;s peers, consider why. It might be that you truly aren&apos;t ready yet; after all, no one is <span class="CharOverride-1">actually</span>
 born ready. But it might also be that impostor syndrome is holding you back <a href="text00030.html#_idTextAnchor534">(see Don&apos;t let Impostor Syndrome hold you back in Chapter 19)</a>

<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor726" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Myths about becoming a people manager</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here are a few ways that are NOT how people become people managers.</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Being at the company the longest</span>
 . Management isn&apos;t a queue where the people who have been waiting the longest are next in line to become a manager. It&apos;s about being the best candidate, not the one with the most tenure.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Interviewing</span>
 . Most companies don&apos;t interview people for internal promotions to management. Instead, what usually happens is that your manager or their manager picks the person they believe would be the best candidate and offers them the role. They only open the role to external candidates after they&apos;ve decided not to go with an internal promotion. Some companies, however, <span class="CharOverride-1">do</span>
 have policies that allow people to apply for internal management roles.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Outshining your manager</span>
 . You&apos;re not competing with your manager for their job. You could be promoted to be your manager&apos;s peer or to fill your manager&apos;s spot when they leave, but even in those situations, your manager&apos;s recommendation makes a difference.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Remember that to be promoted, people must <span class="CharOverride-1">want</span>
 to promote you. You need to stand out from the crowd because you&apos;re great, not because you&apos;ve pushed away the others.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor727" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Managing your former peers</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When you first become a people manager, you might end up managing people who used to be your peers. That can be a bit awkward for everyone involved, so remember to be tactful in your transition.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This could be a sensitive time for your old teammates. They might have wanted to become a manager and could think it&apos;s unfair that you were chosen over them. They may not see you as more senior, and they might let you know it.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Don&apos;t let that hurt your confidence. You were selected for a reason.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Try the following to help the transition go more smoothly:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">You don&apos;t need to put on a show that you&apos;re the big boss now. It&apos;s okay to treat your old teammates mostly like peers, especially at first.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">If you are planning to change the way you interact with them, take extra care to explain the change so it doesn&apos;t feel like a power play.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">At the same time, you need to set clear boundaries and not tolerate any disrespect. If they ignore your requests, you&apos;ll need to address it immediately.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Get a full handoff from their old manager to understand their personal development plan, how they&apos;re progressing, and any important information about their past performance. Are they close to a raise or a promotion? Get copies of past reviews.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Have a conversation about their career goals in the first month. This helps establish your new role and ensures you won&apos;t put it off until it&apos;s too late.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Most of the time though, PMs assume this will be more awkward than it is. Your peers will usually recognize that you deserve this promotion, and they&apos;ll be happy for you.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor728" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Key Takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">People management can be a lot less fun than it seems</span>
 : PMs tend to be ambitious and latch on to people management as a prominent milestone, but it&apos;s not the only way to have a successful PM career. You might feel more satisfied and get less burned out if you stay in an IC role for longer.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">You need to be an experienced, successful PM to be eligible to become a manager</span>
 : Many PMs start focusing on moving into management roles way too early in their careers, which distracts them from the skills they actually need to be building. Don&apos;t neglect your PM skills.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
