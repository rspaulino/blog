<span class="AllCaps-Bold _idGenCharOverride-1">Product management is</span>
 one of the most central and pivotal functions in modern technology companies. Ironically, the PM role is also one of the least well understood. What are the responsibilities of a PM? How do you measure their success? What skills are the most important in a product manager? What should you expect from an interview? What is the path for advancement? In <span class="CharOverride-1">Cracking the PM Career</span>
 , Gayle McDowell and Jackie Bavaro do an excellent job detailing the PM role, the requirements, how to thrive and excel, and what to expect as you embark on a PM career.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I spent 13 years at Google, joining in 1999 as an early employee. The company grew and evolved considerably during my tenure there, and, in 2002, I was one of the founding members of the PM organization. In total, I spent just over a decade as a product manager and leader. From that first hand experience, I can say that product management is an interesting, varied, and challenging role. Every day is different, every product is unique, and every product manager’s approach and what they bring to the role is distinct. Further, the role of product manager varies considerably from company to company.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">One of the most crucial skills required of a PM is managing through influence. Product managers rarely have management responsibilities over the engineers building the product. As a product manager, your responsibilities naturally flow to the product and managing to meet the market need. However, to meet the market need, you will need to convince the engineering teams to build the product, requiring you to use influence rather than authority. Each product manager will draw on their own toolset—persuasiveness, supporting data, user studies, design principles, relationship building—to achieve this. Managing through influence is one of the most important skills a product manager must develop and is also the most nuanced.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As I established Google’s Associate Product Manager program, our vision was to hire new college graduates and train them to be great product managers in the specific way Google needed. That meant we needed to figure out which aspects of the role mattered most and how to support someone learning them. As <span class="CharOverride-1">Cracking the PM Career</span>
 illustrates, the list of skills is long: communication, listening, organization, prioritization, studying users and markets, empathy, and so on.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In the APM program, we found that one of the best ways to learn these skills was to take raw talent (smart, strong technologists) and give them real hands-on experience, coupled with a lot of feedback and coaching. While all of the chapters of <span class="CharOverride-1">Cracking the PM Career</span>
 are valuable and give depth of perspective, I suspect that many readers will find the Product Leader Q&amp;As among the most helpful. These are real stories from well-respected product leaders in the trenches.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Cracking the PM Career</span>
 acts as a roadmap to understanding product management and how to establish a successful career as a PM. I applaud Jackie (a Google APM alum) and Gayle in creating an in-depth manual to help those entering and mastering the field of product management.</p>
