<span class="AllCaps-Bold _idGenCharOverride-1">If you&apos;re looking</span>
 to land a new job, this book can help you deeply understand the PM role and emphasizes the right skills and experiences to get you leveled correctly. That being said, you&apos;ll probably want to pair this book with one focused on interview preparation.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Our first co-authored book, <a id="_idIndexMarker947"></a>
 <span class="CharOverride-1">Cracking the PM Interview</span>
 , is a comprehensive book covering interview preparation. It gives detailed answers to questions like: What experience should you have? How do you make your existing experience translate? What should a great PM <a id="_idIndexMarker948"></a>
 resume and <a id="_idIndexMarker949"></a>
 cover letter look like? How do you master the interview—estimation, behavioral, case, product and technical questions, as well as the all-important pitch?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">We can&apos;t possibly do justice to those topics in this book. For readers who are looking for help landing a job, however, we wanted to offer some basic advice on how to get started.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1219" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Who wants to be a product manager, anyway?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Product management is an incredible role. It&apos;s creative, influential, well-paying, and usually has a reasonable <a id="_idIndexMarker950"></a>
 work-life balance. You get to work with cutting-edge technology, build things that make people happy, and see the impact of your work. You&apos;re seen as a leader, and you develop skills that are useful in any leadership role.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">But, being a PM is not for everyone. Many people <a id="_idIndexMarker951"></a>
 transfer into product management with dreams of being in charge, but they transfer out once they see the reality of the job.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Product managers have influence, but necessarily power. So, how do you know if product management is right for you?</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">Overall, people who are happy and successful as PMs usually care a lot about making a big impact, which balances out the downsides. It&apos;s the end results that they really care about.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Reflect honestly on the following questions to see if you&apos;d be a successful product manager, and, most importantly if you would enjoy it.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1220"></a>
 How do you feel about not building things with your own hands?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">How much satisfaction do you get from creating things yourself? Are you willing to give that up in order to have an impact by influencing others?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As a PM, you don&apos;t write the code yourself, and you may not do the designs, or even come up with the ideas yourself. If things are running behind schedule, or aren&apos;t as polished as you&apos;d like, you can&apos;t just work extra hours to fix it. You&apos;ll have to learn to feel proud of the way you have influenced your team, and of the team&apos;s results.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Additionally, when you directly create things, there is a lot of praise, acknowledgment, and small victories. People praise the designer for a beautiful product, they praise the engineers for the functionality, but the contributions of the product manager are often overlooked.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As a PM, your impact is often invisible to others, so you may get less appreciation or recognition than others on the team. It&apos;s not always easy to tell when you made the right decision, so you&apos;ll need to be able to push forward even when the correct path is unclear.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1221"></a>
 Do you enjoy the work of convincing people?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Do you envision yourself making decisions, and having people just do what you tell them to do? Fortunately, or unfortunately, being a PM is nothing like that.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As a product manager, you are constantly questioned and need to explain your reasoning and prove yourself. You need to convince your immediate team since they won&apos;t blindly go along with your plans if they don&apos;t agree with them. You need to convince executives and stakeholders, as they won&apos;t allocate people to your team or approve your <a id="_idIndexMarker952"></a>
 roadmap if they don&apos;t agree with your choices. Across the company, people will tell you what <span class="CharOverride-1">they</span>
 think you ought to be doing, and complain that you&apos;re not building their &quot;pet&quot; features.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The more seniority you gain, the more controversial the decision-making process becomes. All the easy problems will already be solved by the time things escalate to you.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1222"></a>
 Can you be happy prioritizing instead of getting everything <a id="_idIndexMarker953"></a>
 perfect?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">How important is &quot;perfect&quot; to you? How do you feel when you need to share work that is only 80% good?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As a product manager, there&apos;s always more work than can possibly be done. What little time you do have is fragmented and filled with context switching. You&apos;ll have frequent meetings and other urgent interruptions that make it hard to focus on complex work. You&apos;ll need to get used to sharing unfinished drafts, giving presentations that aren&apos;t fully polished, and making calls with incomplete data. You&apos;ll need to find joy in prioritizing well.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This goes for your product as well. Every additional month you spend adding features or polishing, is a month that users and the business can&apos;t benefit from your product. It takes a lot of prioritization and willingness to say &quot;no&quot; to get by as a PM.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1223" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Landing your first product manager job</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Product management can certainly be a competitive field to break into because there are relatively few jobs compared to the interest. However, because it&apos;s such a cross-functional role that requires a broad range of skills, there is really no single career path into it. You have many options for entering.</p>

 New Grad <span class="CtPMC-Special-Chars">➜</span>
 <a id="_idIndexMarker954"></a>
 Associate Product Manager</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The textbook way to become a product manager is to major in computer science (and maybe minor in business or economics), get a summer <a id="_idIndexMarker955"></a>
 internship, and then move into a full-time role as an associate product manager (APM). APM roles are competitive, so you&apos;ll need multiple signs of excellence to stand out: a high GPA, leadership experience, varsity sports, impressive achievements, student entrepreneurship, or a referral from someone within the company.</p>

 Taking on PM-like tasks at work <span class="CtPMC-Special-Chars">➜</span>
 <a id="_idIndexMarker956"></a>
 Internal transfer</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">For those with more career experience, this is the most common approach. You can lean on your existing credibility to find opportunities to demonstrate your product skills. You could pitch a new feature, help your team with prioritization, or even ask a PM to take on a little of their work. Just be warned, this will probably be done in addition to your current work, not instead of it.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1226"></a>
 Well-known tech company <span class="CtPMC-Special-Chars">➜</span>
 PM at a smaller company</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you currently have a non-PM job at a top tech company and can&apos;t get an internal transfer, you might be able to get hired as a PM at a smaller company who really values your big-company experience. Try to learn as much as you can about how the product teams work at your current company and absorb best practices.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1227"></a>
 <a id="_idIndexMarker957"></a>
 MBA <span class="CtPMC-Special-Chars">➜</span>
 Product Manager</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you&apos;re having trouble transferring internally, or if you&apos;re getting PM jobs but they&apos;re not at the caliber you&apos;re aiming for, an MBA might open doors for you. Many companies recruit directly from business schools. Additionally, alumni <a id="_idIndexMarker958"></a>
 networks often help graduates discover job opportunities at any stage of their career. Of course, pursuing further education can be expensive and presents a significant time commitment.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1228"></a>
 Specialized Expertise <span class="CtPMC-Special-Chars">➜</span>
 PM in that field</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It&apos;s tough to get hired as a PM without any PM experience, but if you have important industry expertise, a company (especially a startup) might be willing to take a chance on you. People have made the leap from doctor to health startup PM, lawyer to legal software PM, or teacher to educational technology PM. Some even land their first PM job by being the app&apos;s biggest power user.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1229"></a>
 <a id="_idIndexMarker959"></a>
 Networking <span class="CtPMC-Special-Chars">➜</span>
 Working at a friend&apos;s company</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A less common path is getting hired directly as a PM through your <a id="_idIndexMarker960"></a>
 network. In some ways, this is similar to the internal transfer path; your past reputation and relationships give you the credibility to get a chance at the role. Sometimes, this lands you at a startup where you&apos;re the only PM. So, it&apos;s important to network with PMs outside the company to get the PM-specific support you need.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1230"></a>
 Cold outreach to a small company <span class="CtPMC-Special-Chars">➜</span>
 PM at the company</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Getting your first PM job by reaching out directly to a hiring manager is a very tricky path, but many PMs credit their careers to this approach, especially when they were already a power user of the product. This requires finding the manager, figuring out the best way to contact them, and having a compelling enough message that they&apos;ll take the time to meet with you. Asking for a <a id="_idIndexMarker961"></a>
 coffee chat instead of an interview lowers the stakes and increases the chance that the hiring manager will say yes.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">For the best chances of success, make sure to bring your ideas and analysis about the app. This demonstrates your ability to think about product in general, and the benefit you could bring to the company in particular.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1231"></a>
 Founder of acquired startup <span class="CtPMC-Special-Chars">➜</span>
 PM at the parent company</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If there&apos;s one thing that&apos;s harder than breaking into product management, it&apos;s starting a company and leading it through acquisition. This certainly isn&apos;t the easy route, but nevertheless, many great PMs started this way. If you&apos;re currently running a startup and want to transition into product management, this is a path worth considering. In fact, even a failed startup can still open doors to a product management job. After all, startup founders and PMs share many of the same responsibilities.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1232" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Coffee Chats</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Coffee chats, also known as &quot;informal chats,&quot; &quot;informational interviews,&quot; or, &quot;I&apos;d love to learn more about the company,&quot; are the secret weapons in your quest for a new job. Even if you&apos;ve researched everything about the company and you&apos;re sure you&apos;d like to work there, it&apos;s always a good idea to ask if you can have a coffee chat with a PM at the company before you apply.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Coffee chats are valuable because people tend to switch between &quot;pitch mode&quot; and &quot;interview mode,&quot; and it&apos;s hard to blend them.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-001-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00068.html#endnote-001">1</a>
</span>
</span>
 During a coffee chat, they&apos;re trying to pitch you on the company and convince you to interview with them. They&apos;re on your side and feel invested in your success. While they also might be hoping to evaluate whether you&apos;re a match, that&apos;s usually secondary to getting you to apply.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When someone is in pitch mode, they&apos;ll share all kinds of useful information that can help your chances of passing the interview. You can ask them about the product strategy, the challenges they&apos;re facing, and what they&apos;ve learned from their customers. You can ask what they look for in PMs, or even directly ask them for interview tips. At the end of the meeting, you can let them know you&apos;re interested in interviewing, and ask what the next steps are.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you&apos;re already talking to a recruiter, they can sometimes help you set up a coffee chat. You can also reach out to PMs at the company directly through social media (such as LinkedIn, Twitter, or sometimes relevant Facebook groups), at a meetup, or even by guessing their email address.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-002-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00068.html#endnote-002">2</a>
</span>
</span>
 Not everyone will say yes to a random coffee chat, but some people will, especially if you&apos;re polite and have caught their interest. Use good judgment when reaching out—if you annoy someone at the company, it could hurt your chances later on.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">To prepare for the coffee chat, make sure you have your pitch ready. This will be your response to the &quot;Tell me about yourself&quot; question. Keep your answer short and be sure to highlight a few relevant talking points (see <a href="text00068.html#_idTextAnchor1235">&quot;Behavioral questions&quot; on page 545</a>
 ). Beyond that, just be friendly and curious. Don&apos;t try to ask questions to show off, point out flaws in their product, or challenge them on their choices.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1233" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <a id="_idIndexMarker962" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Interview questions</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There are six core types of interview questions, each requiring a different approach:<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-003-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00068.html#endnote-003">3</a>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<ol>
<li class="Numbers-Left ParaOverride-1" value="1">Define yourself</li>
<li class="Numbers-Left" value="2">Behavioral questions</li>
<li class="Numbers-Left" value="3">Estimation questions</li>
<li class="Numbers-Left" value="4">Product questions</li>
<li class="Numbers-Left" value="5">Case questions</li>
<li class="Numbers-Left" value="6">Technical questions</li>
</ol>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">For all of these questions, the key to success is practice, practice, and more practice. Ideally, you&apos;ll find a partner to have mock interviews with who will give you honest feedback. Remember that you&apos;ll probably be nervous on the day of the interview, so you need your training to be strong.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When you&apos;re using a framework or step-by-step approach, make sure to use your judgment and adjust your answers for the specific question. Interviewers often want to ensure that you&apos;re not blindly following a framework, and are able to adapt to the kinds of twists and turns that happen in real life. One way this could show up is as a question that seamlessly shifts from one type to another, or questions involving details that invalidate part of a well-known framework.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">For the interviewer&apos;s perspective on these questions, take a look at <a href="text00043.html#_idTextAnchor806">&quot;Designing a PM interview process&quot; in Chapter 30</a>
 .</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1234"></a>
 Define yourself (&quot;The Pitch&quot;)</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">These are open-ended questions like, &quot;Tell me about yourself.&quot; or, &quot;Why do you want to work here?&quot; that give you a chance to shine—or, if you&apos;re unprepared, to flop.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Prepare honest answers that show you&apos;re a strong match for the role. Rehearse your answers until you don&apos;t ramble under pressure.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Great pitches don&apos;t just explain how you got from point A to point B, but rather, they explain <span class="CharOverride-1">why</span>
 you did. They add color to your background. For example, one might say, &quot;In customer support, I learned how much I enjoy connecting with customers, and it inspired me to look at product jobs.&quot;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Be mindful of the length, however. Typically, you should be aiming for a pitch that is about two minutes. Time yourself as you practice; many candidates have no idea that they&apos;re actually speaking for five minutes or longer. Remember, you don&apos;t have to explain every detail of your experience. This isn&apos;t your autobiography. Give only the information that helps to set context and to boost your candidacy.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1235"></a>
 <a id="_idTextAnchor1236"></a>
 Behavioral questions</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Behavioral questions come in many forms. The interviewer could ask how you would respond to a hypothetical situation, or ask for specific details about how you handled a particular type of situation. They may also ask you to elaborate on a particular section of your <a id="_idIndexMarker963"></a>
 resume. Ultimately, they&apos;re looking at the same two factors: your content and your communication. Make sure to nail both.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">To prepare, master five key stories that best represent why you&apos;re a great PM candidate. These are the stories that you&apos;ll try to fit in whenever you have a chance. This is where you get to demonstrate your &quot;wow factor.&quot;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It&apos;s a good idea to ensure your stories offer coverage for each of the five main topics below. Make sure your key stories represent the scope and complexity that match the level at which you&apos;re trying to get hired. Choose recent stories that demonstrate the depth of your skills. Note that many stories might fall into two or more buckets, and that&apos;s fine. These five main topics are:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Leadership/Influence</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Teamwork</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Successes</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Challenges/Conflict</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Mistakes/Failures</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Good responses are well-structured, and there are frameworks to help you do this. Many candidates go with the <a id="_idIndexMarker964"></a>
 STAR (Situation/Task/Action/Result) or <a id="_idIndexMarker965"></a>
 SAR (Situation/Action/Result) framework, but we&apos;ve found this isn&apos;t ideal for many PM questions. It leaves the candidate telling facts about what happened, but leaving out so much of the good stuff.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The best answers focus on a problem they solved and the insights they discovered. And hence the <a id="_idIndexMarker966"></a>
 PEARL framework was born.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-004-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00068.html#endnote-004">4</a>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor1237"></a>
 Problem</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Start with the setup of the business or customer problem you faced. Give enough background so the interviewer can see that your boss didn&apos;t hand you a fully formed project. You want to highlight the distance between the ambiguous problem you started with and the refined problem you decided to address.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">By framing the story as a problem, you&apos;re drawing the interviewer in and helping them understand why it&apos;s important. You can start with the larger problem that your overall product is solving, and then get into the specific problem that you want to tell a story about. If this is a story about an interpersonal conflict, start with the business problem or goals to set the context, and then describe the interpersonal problem.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor1238"></a>
 Epiphany</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Next, share your epiphany or insight. What did you learn or realize that kicked off your action? What did you see that other people were missing? How does that contrast with the &quot;obvious&quot; path? How did you learn this? Did it come from customer research, data analysis, or somewhere else?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This might sound like &quot;Everyone thought we should do X, but based on Y, I realized we should actually do Z.&quot;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If there&apos;s no epiphany, this probably isn&apos;t the best story to demonstrate your skills. If you just did the obvious thing, anyone could have done it.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor1239"></a>
 Action</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The action is the work you did to make it happen. Keep it short and focus on the things that you did that another PM might not have done as well. You don&apos;t need to list out every step of the process—just the difficult or clever parts.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Give your interviewer enough context to understand how challenging your role was. That said, be diplomatic when the challenge was dealing with other people. You don&apos;t want to sound too negative or give the impression that you don&apos;t work well with others. If the other person was challenging in some way, it might be helpful to show empathy and understanding about why—not only will this demonstrate your empathy, but it also comes off less accusatory.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor1240"></a>
 Result</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The result is a happy ending. It&apos;s okay to have setbacks and failures in the story, but you should treat those as the middle of the story.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">For example, if you&apos;re talking about a failed experiment, end with how you iterated and had a successful launch later, or how you used what you learned to avoid a similar problem at your next company. When you have good results, connect them to the larger goals, strategy, and mission. For example, instead of just talking about how people loved your feature, talk about how it improved retention.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor1241"></a>
 Learning</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Finally, talk about what you learned. What do you wish you knew earlier? What would you do differently next time? Did you get a chance to use what you learned in a later project?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This is especially important for questions about negative events, like mistakes or failures. How did you learn from that and use this learning to make things better? Whenever you&apos;re asked about a negative experience, silently add that part to the question—and to your response.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A great response will deliver a <span class="CharOverride-1">message</span>
 to your interviewer about what type of person you are. Are you <span class="CharOverride-1">relentless</span>
 in pushing through challenges? Are you deeply <span class="CharOverride-1">analytical</span>
 with data? Are you <span class="CharOverride-1">empathetic</span>
 —good at knowing what makes your coworkers &quot;tick&quot;? Are you creative and able to find unusual solutions to problems? Think <span class="CharOverride-1">adjectives</span>
 —the sorts of things you&apos;d find on a list of &quot;strengths and weaknesses.&quot;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Your interviewer is trying to extract a signal <a href="text00043.html#_idTextAnchor801">(see Signal in Chapter 30)</a>
 from you. Make it easy for them to find it.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1242"></a>
 Estimation questions</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Estimation questions such as, &quot;How many pizzas are sold in the US each year?&quot; are entirely about the process you take to solve them. Typically, the interviewer doesn&apos;t know the actual answer and wouldn&apos;t care whether you did either. It&apos;s the journey, not the destination.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-005-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00068.html#endnote-005">5</a>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Interviewers use these questions to evaluate both your problem-solving skills and quantitative skills. These questions can be tackled with an eight-step approach:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Step 1: Clarify the question</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Step 2: Catalog what you know (or wish you knew)</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Step 3: Make an equation</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Step 4: Think about edge cases and alternate sources</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Step 5: Break it down</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Step 6: Review and state your assumptions</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Step 7: Do the math</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Step 8: Check the answer to see if it&apos;s reasonable</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Depending on your background and the role, these questions can feel technical (&quot;How many servers does this product need?&quot;), business-like (&quot;How much money does this product make?&quot;), or simply weird (&quot;How many golf balls can fit in a school bus?&quot;). The approach is generally the same, regardless of the topic.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1243"></a>
 Product questions</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The product question is the heart and soul of the PM interview. It gets directly at the core of what a PM does: design, build, and improve products. While the question may come in various formats, there is one key component you need to understand and focus on: the goal.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Product questions come in three basic formats:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">&quot;What is your favorite product, and why?&quot;</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Design a &lt;product&gt; for &lt;a group&gt;. For example, &quot;Design a chair for the elderly&quot; or, &quot;Design a math app for children.&quot;</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Improve &lt;an existing product&gt;. For example, &quot;How would you improve our company&apos;s sign-in flow?&quot; or &quot;How would you get more people to use Google Maps?&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">These three types of questions have a lot in common, but they each require a different focus and approach.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor1244"></a>
 Favorite Products</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It&apos;s common for interviewers to ask you to discuss some of your favorite products—so much so, that it would be a huge mistake to enter an interview without some idea of what you&apos;ll discuss. Going into an interview without preparing for this question could make the difference between getting hired and getting a &quot;thanks, but no thanks&quot; email.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Prepare at least five different products in advance so you don&apos;t freeze, or have to start from scratch when they ask you to choose a product. But, be careful not to appear as though you&apos;re reciting a prepared answer, or the interviewer might make you switch to a different product—interviewers want to see how you think on your feet.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As you prepare, look for a diverse range of products—websites, mobile applications, and physical products. You wouldn&apos;t want to only prepare mobile apps, and then get stuck on a question like, &quot;What&apos;s your favorite website?&quot;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Start by discussing why you love it, and look to show product insight. At a minimum, you should discuss the <a id="_idIndexMarker967"></a>
 use cases (tip: that&apos;s good &quot;PM&quot; language to use), and how the product solves those problems. You should be able to discuss how the product is better than the alternative options. Make sure that you also have ideas for how you would improve the product.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Truly impressive answers go a level deeper. They demonstrate true product insight at a level that non-PMs might struggle to explain. For example, a PM could discuss some unexpected things that Airbnb does to build a sense of community, and how this is integral to the trust required in sharing spaces with strangers. As a rule of thumb, if you can imagine your non-technical and non-PM friends and family outlining the same explanation, you probably haven&apos;t gone deep enough.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor1245"></a>
 Designing a new product</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Designing a new product requires a holistic view of all the elements that contribute to a successful product launch. You&apos;ll usually want to focus on a target audience that your product could actually win, while not narrowing the audience so much that they are no longer big enough to be worth going after.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There is a lot to cover, so make sure to use the whiteboard (or paper, if the interview room doesn&apos;t have a whiteboard). It can help keep you organized and communicate a structured process to your interviewer.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor1246"></a>
 Step 1: Ask questions</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Ask questions to define exactly what a product, or part of a product, is and who the user is.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-006-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00068.html#endnote-006">6</a>
</span>
</span>
 Think carefully about the user. For example, the term &quot;children&quot; is quite broad, since a small child&apos;s needs are quite different from a teenager&apos;s. Or, you could be asked to design a remote for blind people—but what kind of remote?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Some of the best candidates also discuss priorities. Are we optimizing for customer experience? Making money? Improving operational efficiency?</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor1247"></a>
 Step 2: Provide a structure</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It&apos;s a great idea to provide a structure for the problem, ideally on the whiteboard. One of your goals is to demonstrate good communication skills, so outlining what you&apos;re going to do in the next few steps is handy. Additionally, it can help keep you on track.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor1248"></a>
 Step 3: Discuss users and user segmentation</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">We&apos;ve already touched on the users in Step 1, but it can be useful to go a step further and segment our users. For example, you could segment amusement park guests into season pass holders, repeated guests, and first-time guests.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Some products have &quot;hidden&quot; users, so it can be useful to discuss that here. For example, products designed for children might also be used by their parents, teachers, and caregivers.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Once you&apos;ve done this, you might ask the interviewer if they have a particular segment they&apos;d like you to design for. If they let you choose, look for one which has the biggest <a id="_idIndexMarker968"></a>
 pain points (problems with the current system).</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor1249"></a>
 Step 4: Discuss <a id="_idIndexMarker969"></a>
 use cases and goals</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Now, we want to discuss what our users are doing. What are their goals? Why are they using this product? What are their core use cases? Are there any &quot;unexpected&quot; uses we should prepare for, like a young child putting the toy in their mouth?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Excellent answers often go deeper and discuss underlying motivations or values. Small children, for example, often want to feel big and important, while teens may value independence.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-007-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00068.html#endnote-007">7</a>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor1250"></a>
 Step 5: Current pain points</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Of these use cases, what isn&apos;t going so well? What are the weak spots or <a id="_idIndexMarker970"></a>
 pain points? What are they using right now?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Some use cases might be addressed quite well with current options, but others have major pain points.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor1251"></a>
 Step 6: Solve the problem(s)</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Now that you understand who the user is, what their use cases are, and what&apos;s bothering them, you can attempt to address their needs.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Be careful not to prematurely dismiss a pain point as unsolvable. For example, if bad weather conditions are a pain point, an app <span class="CharOverride-1">can</span>
 address it. It can&apos;t control the weather, but it can provide information about weather conditions.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor1252"></a>
 Step 7: Wrap things up</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">We can now close with a summary of our app and its core features. At this point, if not earlier, your interviewer will likely ask you some follow-up questions. These questions are often about implementation, priorities, or extensions.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If your interviewer disagrees with you, don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s normal. They might genuinely disagree, or they might want to see how you react to disagreement. In either case, you should consider their perspective, think, then do whatever is best given the users and our priorities.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor1253"></a>
 Improving a product</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Improving a product is closely related to designing a new product, but the focus can be quite different. Make sure you clarify—or decide—what &quot;improve&quot; actually means. For example, it could mean user growth, revenue growth, delight, or enabling a new use case. With this in mind, adapt your process to tackle that specific type of improvement. As you&apos;re tackling the problem, remember that you&apos;re supposed to come up with the best possible improvement, not just <span class="CharOverride-1">any</span>
 improvement or a scattered set of minor improvements.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In practice, this means you&apos;ll want to evaluate each idea against the goal and quickly discard any paths that aren&apos;t promising. You&apos;ll also want to show the interviewer that you&apos;ve comprehensively considered every good approach, so they&apos;ll be convinced your idea is one of the best, not just the first idea you thought of. As you slice up your user base or problem space, double check the slices you&apos;re <span class="CharOverride-1">not</span>
 including to see if they might hold the larger opportunity.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1254"></a>
 Case questions</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Case questions are hypothetical situations that usually revolve around delivering the best product to customers. Interviewers are looking for candidates who will structure the problem, ask appropriate questions, show strong instincts and initiative, and drive (not ride) the conversation.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Practice is certainly helpful for these questions. It can also help to stay on top of business and technology news, especially around controversial topics. Follow along with what people say the companies did well or poorly, and what they think should be changed.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You can also study common frameworks such as:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">
<a href="text00025.html#_idTextAnchor461">Customer Purchase Decision-Making Process</a>
</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">
<a href="text00025.html#_idTextAnchor463">Marketing Mix (4 Ps)</a>
</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">
<a href="text00025.html#_idTextAnchor465">SWOT Analysis</a>
</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">
<a href="text00025.html#_idTextAnchor467">The Five Cs (Situational Analysis)</a>
</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">
<a href="text00025.html#_idTextAnchor469">Porter&apos;s 5 Forces</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Please note that while these frameworks offer useful concepts, interviewers generally aren&apos;t testing your knowledge of these frameworks; they may not even be aware of them. Don&apos;t try to force a framework where it doesn&apos;t belong. Sometimes, you might use these concepts as inspiration for tackling a topic rather than using them directly.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1255"></a>
 Technical questions</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Many companies, including Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, sometimes ask PM candidates coding and algorithm questions—particularly with more junior PM candidates. These questions can range from straightforward coding to more complex algorithms, which may or may not be followed by a request to code.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">With that said, the expectations, particularly around syntax, are generally lower than they would be for a developer. Many interviewers will even be satisfied with code-like pseudocode.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">To prepare, you should brush up on these <a href="text00013.html#_idTextAnchor232">(see Algorithms and Data Structures in Chapter 8)</a>
 :</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Data structures (arrays, hash tables, trees, linked lists, stacks, queues)</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Algorithms (sorting, binary search, graph search)</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Concepts (big O notation, recursion)</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You can ask the company if you&apos;ll have a technical interview, and if so, of what type (coding, system design, etc.). Don&apos;t stress until you need to! Many PMs never see interviews of this sort. And those who get them do often perform much better than they expect.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-008-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00068.html#endnote-008">8</a>
</span>
</span>
 These interviews are primarily about problem-solving and showing a basic technical familiarity. Even if your coding skills are rusty, the skills <span class="CharOverride-1">actually</span>
 being tested in these interviews are likely still strong.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you have no coding experience, there&apos;s little sense worrying about this. A company is unlikely to ask a non-coder to code.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-009-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00068.html#endnote-009">9</a>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You could also be asked questions that are technical, but non-coding. These could be questions about designing system architecture, explaining a technical concept, diagnosing a bug or performance problem, or performing a technical task that relates to their product. These sorts of questions are more common for companies or roles that are very technical. The company wants to validate that you have the right experience.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you find yourself lost, attempting to solve the problem is always better than giving up.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1256"></a>
 Miscellaneous questions</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The earlier categories of questions should mostly cover you, but there are other questions that could fall outside of this—or at least appear to. Mohit, a PM candidate, was asked, &quot;How would you evacuate San Francisco?&quot; How would you classify this sort of question?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When in doubt, try to quickly assess what you <span class="CharOverride-1">think</span>
 the interviewer is trying to assess. Is it user empathy, structured problem solving, creativity, etc? That can often give you a good clue about how to tackle the problem.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">After that, try approaching roughly like this:</p>
<ol>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-2" value="1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Ask questions.</span>
 Think about the who / what / how / why sorts of questions. You need to understand the constraints of the problem. For example, if you&apos;re evacuating San Francisco, you&apos;ll want to understand why you&apos;re evacuating, how long you have, and who.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-2" value="2">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Structure the problem solving.</span>
 Structuring the problem not only helps you develop a more comprehensive solution, but it also demonstrates that you&apos;re a structured sort of person. Interviewers like that!</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-2" value="3">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Solve.</span>
 Listen to the interviewer and ask questions as needed, but assume you should be in the driver&apos;s seat. Leverage the structure you came up with and solve the problem. If you have a whiteboard or shared text editor, this can be useful to share your thoughts with your interviewer.</li>
</ol>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Consider a very odd question like, &quot;Find all the uses that you can for a paperclip.&quot; Force yourself to ask questions (Uses for me or for anyone? Do I have one paperclip or several—or even millions? Can I modify the paperclip—bend it, melt it, etc?). Then find a structure (&quot;Let me break this down by solutions for one paperclip vs. solutions for a dozen vs. solutions for thousands.&quot;) Now, solve for each of these pieces. What are the things you might use a single paperclip for? You can even break that down further.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There are no guarantees—after all, we&apos;re talking about questions that <span class="CharOverride-1">don&apos;t</span>
 seem to fit a pattern—but asking questions and applying a structure is nearly always a good thing.</p>

The startup CEO, if they have some coding background, usually outperforms the average dev on their team, on the coding interviews!
