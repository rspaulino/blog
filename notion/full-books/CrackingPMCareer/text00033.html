<p class="First-Paragraph---Main-Book">
<span class="AllCaps-Bold _idGenCharOverride-1">Ten minutes into</span>
 my first meeting with the CTO, he just walked out. &quot;If that&apos;s how you feel, I think we&apos;re done here,&quot; he said, metaphorically slamming the door behind him. Ouch.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This would have been a huge consulting project for me, revamping a massive company&apos;s hiring process. I (Gayle) had done some initial &quot;evaluation&quot; work to assess fit, which involved reviewing a set of hiring packets and presenting my recommendations. All went well—until this final step of the approval process.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Fundamentally, the exec and I disagreed on what—to him—was a major philosophical point. A hiring manager was trying to rationalize hiring an experienced engineer with no degree, and I didn&apos;t understand the concern. I wrote a comment to the effect of &quot;Why is this such a big deal? The candidate has 20 years of experience. Any degree at this point is largely irrelevant.&quot;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The CTO disagreed and challenged me on my perspective.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">&quot;Would Google do this?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">&quot;Yes, I believe so,&quot; I responded. (In fact, I knew so. I had plenty of degree-less coworkers there.)</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">&quot;No they wouldn&apos;t.&quot; He scoffed. This is when he stated his earlier line and left. And that was it for our meeting.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">But did it have to be? And, more importantly, was it salvageable?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">His employees—who apparently sided with me (and were used to his storming out)—offered some advice. He looks up to companies like Google; if you&apos;re right that they don&apos;t require degrees, show him that. Stand your ground, but back what you&apos;re saying with data.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Ultimately, this salvaged the project, and it&apos;s what I should have done from the beginning.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The hiring manager&apos;s rationalization was a clue that I&apos;d missed: some key decision maker must really value degrees. That issue needed to be confronted head-on, rather than via my little offhand remark. Moreover, the way to influence the CTO wasn&apos;t by showing degrees weren&apos;t that important; it was to appeal to his desire to &quot;be like Google.&quot;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There was no miscommunication—we were quite clear about what we each believed—but there was a communication error nonetheless.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">&quot;Communication&quot; is much more than just making your thoughts comprehensible. It is about understanding what your audience values, and picking up on the clues in their words and behavior. It&apos;s about tailoring what you say to them, and being proactive in addressing potential disconnects. It&apos;s about persuading by leveraging their values, rather than your own.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor591" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Responsibilities</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor592"></a>
 Learn what your audience thinks and cares about</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Imagine you could give people a magic potion that would let them see inside your brain and know everything you know, and read all your thoughts. Would that be the perfect communication tool?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">No!</p>
<p class="Text-Center"><img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-1" src="Image00053.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Communication isn&apos;t about transferring your thoughts over to someone else; in fact, it&apos;s almost the opposite. Clear communication is about understanding what other people think, and figuring out how to close the gap between their state of mind and yours.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">For example, imagine you&apos;re trying to convince the executive team to invest in a new product your team wants to build. You provide plenty of evidence to show it would bring in a lot of revenue, but your idea is shot down. How could that happen?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The problem might just be that you didn&apos;t understand the executive team&apos;s goals and worries. This means that the data you gathered, despite the thoroughness, was ultimately irrelevant to them. Instead of revenue, they might be more focused on user growth. Or they might not have the right kind of salesperson to sell your product.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Effective communication directly addresses the goals and worries of the audience.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Try to build a mental model of the people you&apos;re talking to. Guess where they&apos;ll agree and where they&apos;ll be more skeptical. Try to predict their concerns and the questions they may ask you. If you&apos;re not sure, ask them!</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor593"></a>
 Get clear about what you want to say</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Clear communication starts with clear thinking. If you&apos;re confused about what you&apos;re trying to say, other people will be too.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">These approaches can help you clarify your thinking:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Draw diagrams and create tables.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Try organizing your thoughts in a few different ways—by category, by cause and effect, by priority, or by question.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Try breaking your ideas down into smaller pieces to make them simpler.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Look for the most important points.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Sleep on it.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It&apos;s often helpful to distill your thoughts down to three key points. If this is tricky, that might be a sign that you aren&apos;t clear enough about your argument.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor594" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Growth Practices</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor595"></a>
 Tailor your communication for your audience and goals</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Before you start, make sure you know why you&apos;re speaking up, writing a message, or giving a presentation. What kind of a response do you want?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If your boss tells you that you need to send out a message, make sure to figure out what your goals should be. If you don&apos;t ask, you might guess incorrectly.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The details here can matter. For example, if the goal of your status update is to help everyone feel proud of the work your team has done, you might end it with &quot;Give Amy, Bob, and Charles a high five next time you see them!&quot; If your main goal was to encourage people across the company to test the product you might start it with &quot;Last chance to give feedback before the launch!&quot;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">What information can you give the audience to make it as easy as possible for them to give you a good response?</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Do you need to change their mind about something, or address one of their worries?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Do they need to see how your idea connects to their goals? Can you start from an idea they believe in and show them step-by-step how it leads to your conclusion?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Would a template or specific instructions help them? For example, &quot;share the five features that you think would most reduce ticket count.&quot;</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Might they feel defensive, micro-managed, criticized, or disrespected? Can you frame the message more carefully?</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As you write your message, keep in mind that your message will probably not be read carefully. People will skim it—so make it skimmable! Use bullets, bold fonts (don&apos;t get excessive here, though!), headlines, and so on.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor596"></a>
 Catch miscommunications as they happen</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Miscommunication can happen to anyone, but some people get caught by it a lot. Anyone might misread a word or get caught by surprise when a coworker has a different definition, and that&apos;s to be expected. But some people don&apos;t catch the problems in the moment, which leads to a lot of frustration.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">People who don&apos;t notice their miscommunication tend to hear what they want to hear or what they expect to hear. They miss the clues.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Good communicators predict how the people around them will behave and notice any surprises. Anna Marie Clifton explains: &quot;When someone replies differently than I expected, that&apos;s a clue that I don&apos;t understand them very well or one of us doesn&apos;t understand what&apos;s being communicated.&quot;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here are some more techniques for reducing miscommunication:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Pay attention to non-verbal signals like tone, facial expressions, and body language to see if people agree, disagree, or are confused.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Don&apos;t overlook strange questions or wording, since it might be a sign of a misunderstanding.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Try to predict how people will act and pay attention to when they act differently.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Double check if someone seems fine with a change you expected them to protest.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Define the key terminology you use in a shared glossary.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Reflect back what you heard in different words.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Follow up on verbal agreements in writing.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you find that you&apos;re being misunderstood frequently, seek out the advice of a trusted colleague or mentor. Perhaps you use unusual phrasing, or just that tone is poorly conveyed in writing.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor597"></a>
 Redirect conversations to the right issues</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The next time you get in a conversation that doesn&apos;t seem to be going anywhere, take a step back and see if you&apos;re arguing about the wrong thing.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Let&apos;s say you&apos;re debating the placement of a button with your designer: you want the button to be visible all the time but the designer wants it to only appear when the user hovers. This might sound like a conversation about visuals and clutter, but it really ought to be a conversation about the <a id="_idIndexMarker481"></a>
 target audience and their discoverability needs.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Sometimes, tiny disagreements represent much deeper unresolved issues. An engineer might dig in her heels on a small visual change when the real issue is that she feels like she has wasted her time because an executive has been changing his mind on previously approved designs.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Ask yourself &quot;what is this conversation really about?&quot; and redirect the conversation to the more fundamental issues.</p>

 Concepts and Frameworks</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor599"></a>
 Best practices for written communication</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Use a good opening</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Do</span>
 use a clear subject line for emails including keywords that accurately describe the contents and helps people judge how soon they need to read it, eg. &quot;When is the next product review?&quot;</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Don&apos;t</span>
 write mysterious subject lines like &quot;You&apos;ll never guess what&apos;s coming next…&quot; It sounds spammy.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Don&apos;t</span>
 start chats with &quot;Hi&quot; or &quot;Can I ask a question?&quot; Just ask the question. If you need, you can say &quot;Is your screen private now?&quot; or, &quot;I&apos;ve got a timely question, are you around right now?&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Keep it short and scannable</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Do</span>
 use bullet points to make sure separate ideas don&apos;t get lost in a paragraph.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Do</span>
 use headings and other kinds of formatting and labels to help people understand and navigate your writing.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Do</span>
 provide a tl;dr or executive summary at the top.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">

</span>
</span>
</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Don&apos;t</span>
 leave non-critical details or extra explanations in the main flow. You can include them in an appendix or follow-up comment.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Do</span>
 use pictures, prototypes, or diagrams to reinforce the important ideas.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Do</span>
 use emojis and humor to encourage people to read what you wrote, depending on your company culture. Tone is often poorly conveyed by writing, and a simple :) can actually help.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Don&apos;t</span>
 let humor get in the way of the meaning of what you wrote.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Make the call to action clear</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Do</span>
 be explicit about what you want people to do, and by when.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Do</span>
 assign tasks or invite people to an event on their calendar to make sure they don&apos;t miss the action they&apos;re supposed to take, depending on your company culture.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Do</span>
 tell people exactly where to give you feedback, for example as comments in the document or in a private message.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Do</span>
 create templates or forms to make sure you get a response in the format you need.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Don&apos;t</span>
 hide a request at the bottom of a long email. Place it at the beginning and then ask people to read on for details.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Know when to move to a live conversation</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Do</span>
 move to a live conversation if people are starting to type novel-length emails to one another, are misunderstanding each other, or are arguing.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Do</span>
 move to a live conversation when it&apos;s taking you a long time to figure out how to type up what you want to say, especially when you&apos;re worried about how to get the tone right.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Do</span>
 use chat or walk to someone&apos;s desk when you need a quick response, for example if the site is down or if your coworker might head home before they see your message.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Don&apos;t</span>
 send a chat or email if you wouldn&apos;t want it to show up on the front page of a newspaper. Obviously don&apos;t do illegal or unethical things anywhere, but written communication is prone to being taken out of context.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Hone your skills</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Do</span>
 ask a mentor to review important communication before you send it out.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Do</span>
 workshop your writing after-the-fact if something goes wrong.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Written communication is <a id="_idIndexMarker482"></a>
 asynchronous—the writer can write and send their message on their own time, and the reader can read the message at their own convenience. When that time delay is acceptable, written communication is a great way to be respectful of people&apos;s time, with the added benefit that you&apos;ll keep a record of what you said.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor600"></a>
 Best practices for live conversations</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Be respectful of people&apos;s flow state</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Don&apos;t</span>
 walk up to someone&apos;s desk and interrupt them when they&apos;re in the middle of something important.</li>

 look at the other person&apos;s calendar and try not to schedule a meeting that would break up a large chunk of time.</li>

<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Don&apos;t ramble</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Do</span>

<span class="CharOverride-1">Do</span>
 think out loud when you&apos;re mentoring people to show them your thought process.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Some people love tossing ideas back and forth in a spontaneous conversation, while others consider it a big interruption. Get to know your teammates to learn what works for each of them.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor601"></a>
 Best practices for running meetings</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Have goals and an agenda for each meeting</p>

<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Assign a note taker</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Do</span>
 have someone take notes during the meeting</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Don&apos;t</span>
 distribute the responsibility unfairly. Set up a rotation so that you won&apos;t end up in a situation where some people are disproportionately burdened by notetaking.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">

<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Match the meeting format to the goals</p>

 keep decision-making meetings small. Six people or fewer is best.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Do</span>

<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Ensure everyone has a chance to share their thoughts</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Do</span>
 send information before the meeting so people can prepare their thoughts in advance</li>

 Best practices for presentations</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Get comfortable</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Do</span>
 find a public speaking role model. Not every style works for every person, so you want to find someone you&apos;d feel comfortable and authentic emulating. You can browse through Ted Talks to find a variety of great speakers.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">

</span>
</span>
</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Do</span>
 chit-chat with the audience to get comfortable before your presentation. Some friendly conversation about your weekend plans can help you feel like you&apos;re presenting to friends rather than strangers and scary executives.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Do</span>
 show up early to make sure the audio and video is working correctly.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Do</span>
 practice before important presentations.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Be clear</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Do</span>
 be clear about the implications and takeaways of the information you&apos;re presenting. Imagine someone is standing there asking &quot;so what?&quot; after each thing you say. It might be obvious to you why it matters that, say, people use your product mostly in the morning, but spell it out for the audience.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Do</span>
 check in with people to make sure your presentation speed and content is working for them. When you&apos;re presenting to a small group, you can plan a short version of your presentation and then have backup slides to dig into the details and explanations if anyone wants to know more. For presentations to a large audience, you can do a dry run for a smaller group and ask them for feedback.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Don&apos;t</span>
 bury the lede. It might be tempting to hide your final recommendation until the end to build up suspense, but don&apos;t. It&apos;s difficult for your audience to follow along, absorb the information, and ask the right questions if they don&apos;t know what it&apos;s building up to.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Keep people engaged</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Do</span>
 show some energy and try to look like you&apos;re having fun. Giving a presentation is a privilege. When you sound passionate about the work you&apos;re presenting, your audience will rarely be bored.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Don&apos;t</span>
 fill your slides up with text or read off your slides, especially when the presentation is meant to be entertaining. You can use speaker notes to remind yourself what you want to say, but if you&apos;re just reading off your slides, people will have a hard time staying focused. Instead, try using your slides mostly for images and a few keywords.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Do</span>
 share examples, quotes, and anecdotes. Stories help people understand and remember the points you make. When you speak abstractly, people might not know how to interpret what you say, so the concrete examples help.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Don&apos;t</span>
 be afraid to be funny. People sometimes tune out during long presentations, but humor can draw their attention back in.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Most people are nervous about giving presentations, but it gets easier each time. If you&apos;d like to gain presentation experience quickly, consider joining your local Toastmasters club.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">

 Key Takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Close the gap between their state of mind and yours</span>
 : To communicate well, you need to form a clear model of what the other people know and think. Try to anticipate their questions. Think about what information or support they&apos;ll need to come over to your way of thinking.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Keep your goals in mind</span>
 : Your communication should always have a purpose. If there&apos;s an action you want people to take, make sure your communication makes that clear and easy.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-1">Be respectful of people&apos;s time</span>
 : A large meeting or presentation can easily take up dozens or hundreds of hours of people&apos;s combined time! Plan ahead, have an agenda, and skip or shorten the meeting if possible. The same applies to long emails. At a smaller scale, just interrupting someone when they&apos;re &quot;in the zone&quot; can break their flow and slow down their work.</li>
