<span class="AllCaps-Bold _idGenCharOverride-1">Phil Jackson is</span>
 considered one the greatest basketball coaches of all time. He led teams with players like Dennis Rodman, Kobe Bryant, and Shaquille O&apos;Neal to 11 NBA Championships.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">

<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Coaching famous basketball players isn&apos;t easy. The players are already among the best in the world—a fact their adoring fans remind them of every day. They depend on their teams, but they also want to be recognized for personal greatness. Their sport, like many sports, often celebrates aggression and competitiveness. Tempers run high and often lead to unnecessary fouls and poor teamwork.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">For Jackson, coaching these stars meant fighting through the egos that often come with excellence. He had to not only identify how to improve on greatness, but also motivate them to follow his advice. At times, the latter was the trickiest piece.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">With O&apos;Neal, Jackson realized the biggest impediment was distraction. Jackson said, &quot;Look, if you listen to me, you&apos;ll be MVP. You listen to me, you will win a championship.&quot; When Shaq agreed, Jackson instructed him to stop putting out rap albums, limit his commercials, and do everything he&apos;s told. Focusing on the game led Shaq to his best years of basketball.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-002-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00042.html#endnote-002">2</a>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When it came time to coach Bryant on his <a id="_idIndexMarker566"></a>
 relationships with teammates, Jackson leveraged Bryant&apos;s goal of becoming team captain. &quot;How do you relate to your teammates?&quot;, Jackson asked. Bryant said he didn&apos;t. &quot;That&apos;s not going to work out very well then.&quot; The message got through.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">

<p class="BODY_Emphasis">This is what coaching and development means. It&apos;s understanding what it takes to create a winning team. It&apos;s understanding people&apos;s goals and building trust so they&apos;ll be receptive to your coaching. It&apos;s picking the right combination of feedback, practices, and instruction to grow people into the skills they need to expand their responsibilities and be successful.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The skills in <a href="text00036.html#_idTextAnchor641">Chapter 25: Mentoring</a>
 are an important foundation for coaching and development. As a manager, however, you have additional responsibilities. Coaching is not just about developing people in all the ways they want to grow; it also involves guiding them on which ways they <span class="CharOverride-1">need</span>
 to grow and evaluating how they are doing.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor757" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Responsibilities</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor758"></a>
 Set expectations <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">PMing is a &quot;figure out what needs to be done, and then do it&quot; kind of role, so it&apos;s hard to set clear expectations. It sometimes feels like setting expectations would require figuring out what needs to be done for your reports.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The way around this is to set expectations around outcomes. You can start with the obvious ones: &quot;your team will launch the work and hit the goals.&quot; You can also add expectations for what will go wrong to help people see where the opportunity for &quot;exceeds expectations&quot; lies. As much as you can, set expectations around specific PM skills. For example, if you have a career ladder, you can set expectations that they&apos;ll meet the criteria in a certain bucket by a certain time.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor759"></a>
 Look at their work, even if you&apos;re not the approver <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">PMs create documents, give presentations, send emails, and run meetings. They&apos;re also responsible for the designs, launch plans, and overall quality of their products. Looking at the work itself is an important way to form your own opinions of how your reports are performing and where they might need to improve.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It&apos;s easy to look at the work when you&apos;re officially responsible for approving it, but for other work, you&apos;ll need to have a plan. PMs sometimes bristle at the idea of showing you all of their work because they&apos;re afraid of being micromanaged, or they might just get busy and forget.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It&apos;s important to set expectations around your involvement from the beginning. Start with more oversight before giving more independence, rather than trying to add oversight once things go wrong. Removing independence after a project is underway will always feel like a demotion, so it should be reserved for the time when they actually underperformed.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Be specific about what work they should show you and what decisions they should run by you. Do you want them to forward you relevant conversations with &quot;FYI&quot; to keep you in the loop? Discuss what it will take for them to earn more independence; is there a particular <a id="_idIndexMarker567"></a>
 timeline or milestone?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If possible, set up an organizational structure where you <span class="CharOverride-1">should</span>
 be looking at their work. For example, could the PM manager be the approver for their PM&apos;s work?</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor760"></a>
 Co-create personal development plans <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Work with your reports to create a personal development plan for each of them. It should cover their career goals, their strengths, their challenges, and what they want to work on.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Approach this as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Have them write down their goals and self-assess their skills. All of this is key information in understanding what success looks like to them, so you can find matches between their interests and what the business needs.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Once you&apos;ve seen their goals and self-assessment, compare it to your own assessment of their skills and what they need to do in order to advance.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Pick the top two to four areas for them to focus on; more than that would only end up being distracting.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Work with your report to come up with a plan; what are the milestones or deliverables, and how will you be able to measure progress? This discussion helps you and your reports align on what success looks like.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Check in regularly and make sure there&apos;s alignment between how they think they&apos;re doing, how you think they&apos;re doing, and how their goals match to their actual career progress. You should believe that if they hit their goals, they&apos;d be on track for a <a id="_idIndexMarker568"></a>
 salary increase or a promotion (or getting out of a more dire situation). If not, then consider what it <span class="CharOverride-1">would</span>
 take, and work with them to update the plan to help them get there.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor761"></a>
 Find opportunities for your reports to <a id="_idIndexMarker569"></a>
 stretch their skills <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As a manager, you can help connect people to good opportunities. Recommend them for responsibilities that will allow them to grow. Hand over opportunities that come to you. Ask other managers if they have work that would be good for them. Put them in charge of things that stretch their abilities slightly, and let them know that you trust them and support them.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor762"></a>
 <a id="_idIndexMarker570"></a>
 Scope projects based on experience level <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Choosing a project is much more than just deciding what feature they&apos;re going to work on; you&apos;ll need to give them context and set guidelines for what you expect. In many cases, the exact same work can be scoped up or down to fit varying levels of experience and skill, just by changing those guidelines.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When deciding how much guidance versus freedom to give, it&apos;s better to start on the more restrictive side and loosen up the reins as they earn your trust. It&apos;s easy to loosen up; people feel great when you give them more autonomy. It&apos;s much harder to take away their freedom because they&apos;ll feel demoralized and may even ignore your attempts to rein them in. It helps to explain this framework from the start so that they won&apos;t worry that you&apos;ll micromanage them forever.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here are some guidelines for setting up projects appropriately.</p>

<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It&apos;s great when you can perfectly match a project to the skills of a person so the work is just a slight stretch for them. Sometimes, you don&apos;t have that luxury because there&apos;s important work that needs to be done and there are no other options for who can do it.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you need to scale a complex project down, here are some approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Be transparent that the project is a larger scope than you&apos;d have liked for them. This will help them understand why it seems like they have less <a id="_idIndexMarker574"></a>
 autonomy than usual.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Put them in charge of a single phase of the project, such as running the beta program or taking the project from beta to official launch.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Set clear expectations for the most complex parts that they will draft the work, with final approval from you.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Have more frequent check-ins and working sessions where you can help guide the work.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When in doubt, start with a smaller scope. You can always expand it later.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor763" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Growth Practices</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor764"></a>
 Build a strong <a id="_idIndexMarker575"></a>
 relationship with your reports <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There&apos;s a common saying, &quot;People don&apos;t quit their job; they quit their manager.&quot; Your relationship with your reports is a critical factor in their effectiveness and engagement.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">To create a strong relationship, always ground yourself in positive intentions. Come from a place of believing in your report and being on their side. This doesn&apos;t mean you should overlook their problems or defend poor job performance, but rather, your intention in talking to them should be aimed at helping them to succeed, and not as a way to vent your frustrations.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Make sure you prioritize coaching your reports. You should see coaching them as your primary responsibility, not a distraction or random obligation. Have regular one-on-one meetings (1:1s) and avoid canceling them or arriving late. In fact, skipping 1:1s is widely seen as symbolic of poor management, regardless of the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor765"></a>
 Set aside dedicated time for coaching <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It&apos;s easy for 1:1s to end up focusing on tactical problems and nothing else.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">One approach is to set aside every fourth 1:1 for coaching. You could also spend some time in each 1:1 on coaching topics.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It helps to be clear that you&apos;re coaching them so that your reports can notice and appreciate it. If you coach subtly, you might be surprised to hear that your reports don&apos;t think they&apos;re getting enough coaching from you. One tip is to come up with names or catchy phrases for the frameworks and approaches you share. This helps people feel like they&apos;re learning something substantial.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor766"></a>
 <a id="_idTextAnchor767"></a>
 Make it their responsibility to communicate proactively with you <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">PMs work autonomously, which makes them particularly difficult to manage. It&apos;s hard to be aware of all the work they&apos;re doing or how well they&apos;re doing it. It can also be challenging to insert yourself to course-correct or coach as needed.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">To manage effectively, you&apos;ll need your reports to take the lead on communication. Emphasize that it&apos;s their responsibility to communicate transparently and build trust. Kate Matsudaira, an engineering manager describes it in this way:</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">This implies an implicit contract: I will give you <a id="_idIndexMarker576"></a>
 autonomy and independence, but it is your responsibility to share status and information with me.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-004-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00042.html#endnote-004">4</a>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You can ask your reports to share their work with you using this template:</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">Here&apos;s what&apos;s happening &lt;the current challenge&gt;. Here&apos;s how I &lt;handled it/am handling it/am thinking of handing it&gt;. Do you have any thoughts?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This template lets your reports maintain their autonomy and ownership over the situation while helping you understand the complexity of the work and giving you an opening to mentor.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idIndexMarker577"></a>
 <a id="_idTextAnchor768"></a>
 Solicit feedback from your reports&apos; peers and partners <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">To get a full picture of how well your reports are doing, and to find the most important growth areas for them, you&apos;ll need to get feedback from the people they work with.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Peer feedback, or 360 <a id="_idIndexMarker578"></a>
 feedback, is incredibly useful, but you don&apos;t want to rely solely on the infrequent official review cycles. Instead, you should meet face-to-face with the key partners of your reports and check in with them every few months. Those meetings can help you interpret nuances that might get lost in written feedback.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">PMs tend to take direct quotes from their peers very seriously, so peer feedback can be a very helpful tool. They might not believe you when you tell them that their collaboration style is a problem, but they&apos;d be less likely to dismiss quotes of what their teammates have said.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A scalable source of information is other managers. Sync with them to find out if any of their reports have said anything (good or bad) about any people on your team. If you learn something this way, you&apos;ll need to follow up diplomatically, since the feedback is second hand.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor769"></a>
 Create plans to counteract implicit <a id="_idIndexMarker579"></a>
 bias <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Implicit bias refers to the subconscious assumptions that everyone makes. If left unexamined, these biases can result in actual unfairness.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Few people—hopefully—would aim to be biased, but it can happen without realizing it. For example, in an attempt to increase <a id="_idIndexMarker580"></a>
 diversity, a major tech company established a rule that every interview loop must be at least 40% female. That sounds like a nice idea, but, in many roles, only 20% of their employees were female. The net result is that the women get pulled off of their &quot;real&quot; work and into recruiting an awful lot. And, to make matters worse, promotions didn&apos;t value the recruiting tasks as highly as the other work, leaving women with fewer accomplishments. Good intentions, bad results.</p>
<p class="BODY_Sidebar-Heading" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor770" style=";color:black;"></a>
 An exercise for the reader</p>
<p class="BODY_Sidebar" style=";color:black;">Close your eyes and imagine a successful PM leader pitching a new product in front of an excited audience. What did the PM look like? If you don&apos;t know enough great leaders of different races and genders, you might accidentally overlook talented people who don&apos;t fit your model of what a great PM looks like.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It&apos;s especially important to watch out for bias when it comes to coaching and development. Many times, implicit bias shows up not as being unduly harsh to an underrepresented group, but rather as giving people who look like you the benefit of the doubt and second chances. Try to extend those privileges to everyone.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Consider whether you&apos;re applying your expectations consistently. Are you judging some people on potential and others on accomplishments? Does poor collaboration feel like a minor issue for some people but a major issue for others?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Also consider whether your expectations are actually <span class="CharOverride-1">appropriate</span>
 expectations. Expectations can be applied consistently, but still create bias. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">A hiring manager strongly prefers those who learned to code early in life, seeing it as a sign of passion. Guess who is more likely to have learned to code early? Younger candidates, as well as candidates from wealthier families.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">A hiring manager frowns upon gaps in their candidates&apos; resumes. Guess who is likely to have gaps? Women (due to pregnancy and childbirth), as well as those who have faced serious medical problems (among themselves or their family).</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">A manager values confidence in their employees, and prefers to send the more confident ones into meeting with execs. But how does he judge confidence? The manager didn&apos;t realize it, but he was associating a deeper, louder voice as being more confident. His male employees tended to project great confidence, and thus landed these high-profile tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">All of these expectations ultimately create bias, even though this wasn&apos;t intended. Be sure your expectations are not just <span class="CharOverride-1">applied</span>
 fairly, but are <span class="CharOverride-1">actually</span>
 fair.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In addition to your expectations, review what stretch opportunities you offer, as these are an important area for development. Mekka Okereke, an engineering director at Google, suggests making a spreadsheet of which stretch opportunities you give each report along with their self-identified categories like race and gender. Then, review the spreadsheet and see how the stretch opportunities have been distributed. Does it match with your expectations? If not, you should work to close the gap.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-005-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00042.html#endnote-005">5</a>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Implicit bias is a complex and ambiguous topic, but an important one. We&apos;ve only offered a taste here. We fully encourage you to research this more and/or reach out to consultants who offer further training in this area. Note that anyone can have implicit bias—even against their own &quot;group.&quot;</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor771" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Concepts and Frameworks</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor772"></a>
 Compensation and promotions</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As a manager, it&apos;s your responsibility to learn how compensation and promotions work at your company. Ask around to learn both the official and unspoken rules, so you can help guide your reports through the processes. If you can, buddy up with another manager in a similar position and who has been at the company longer than you have.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The processes and guidelines will vary from company to company, but here are some things to look out for:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">How are the decisions made? How much influence does the manager have in the decision? Are manager recommendations often accepted or bumped down?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">What factors are most influential? How much do peer reviews matter? How much does <a id="_idIndexMarker581"></a>
 visibility amongst managers matter? How much do big launches or launch results matter? What kind of &quot;proof points&quot; are needed?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">What are the constraints? Are there quotas, budgets, minimum-time-in-role guidelines, or other factors? How flexible are those constraints and what are the best ways of advocating for an exception?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">What are the norms? What percentage of employees typically get promotions or compensation increases each year, and what frequency is typical? What sizes are typical? How is compensation balanced between <a id="_idIndexMarker582"></a>
 salary and equity? How frequently are refresher grants given?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Will other managers share information about how their reports are leveled and compensated to help you calibrate?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Is there any documentation around leveling or guidelines? Does your company have good competitive information about compensation? Can the recruiting team help you understand market rates?</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Overall, compensation is a bit of an art and a bit of a science. It takes a lot of experience to feel calibrated on the appropriate size and frequency of raises.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here are some of the factors to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Market Rate</span>
 : How much would you pay to hire this person again? How much would you give as a counteroffer if they said they loved being on your team but received a higher offer from another company? How much would they be paid at a company similar to yours?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1"><a id="_idIndexMarker583"></a>
 <span class="CharOverride-2">Signal</span>
 : What signal do you want to send to this person about their performance and value? Perhaps they&apos;re paid well relative to the market rate, but you still want to give small raises to indicate how much you value them and to represent their increasing value to the company.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Timing and size of increase</span>
 : People&apos;s value and skills improve continuously, but raises are only given at discrete times. Sometimes it&apos;s better to give large increases less often (so the amount feels more substantial). Other times, it&apos;s better to give multiple smaller increases (so they can feel the continual progress).</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1"><a id="_idIndexMarker584"></a>
 <span class="CharOverride-2">Calibration</span>
 : Where does this person stand in comparison to other people on the team? Are the highest value people being paid the most? Unfortunately, it&apos;s difficult to get this perfectly aligned, but you can aim to move in the right direction.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-006-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00042.html#endnote-006">6</a>
</span>
</span>
 If you have a budget, you&apos;ll want to be sure to allocate more of the budget to your top performers, rather than spreading it evenly.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Every once in a while, a manager approaches compensation like they&apos;re negotiating at a street market; they want to pay as little as they can get away with. And when they do that, they typically regret it. The employee will figure out eventually they&apos;re underpaid, and you&apos;ll lose your star performers—costing you more money in the end.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor773"></a>
 Managing <a id="_idIndexMarker585"></a>
 underperformance</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Not everything in management is sunshine and roses. At some point, you&apos;ll probably be faced with a PM who is missing some of the expectations for the job.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This could be for many reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Everyone on the team might love them, but they&apos;re unable to drive decisions and leave the team spinning in circles.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">They could be a &quot;brilliant jerk,&quot; who has great ideas but makes the people around them want to quit.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">They might seem like they have a lot of potential, but they won&apos;t listen to your feedback or follow processes.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">They might be trying really hard but not improving in their handling of complex problems.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">They could have been an amazing employee a year ago but became disengaged over the past several months.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It&apos;s useful to first reflect on what the root cause of the situation might be. Then, ask the following questions.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor774"></a>
 Do I believe I can turn this around?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Bad situations <span class="CharOverride-1">can</span>
 be salvaged, but trust your gut. If you truly believe that this is all some big misunderstanding and your report is eager to fix the problem, you&apos;ve got a good chance of getting things back on track. If you&apos;re holding on because you don&apos;t want to admit failure, you&apos;re just prolonging a painful situation.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Sometimes, you&apos;ll feel like a hypothetical manager in a hypothetical alternate universe could save the situation. Perhaps you&apos;d be able to fix things if you could turn back time and start over, but things have gone on too long to fix now. You&apos;ll build your management skills over time, but for now, you need to be realistic about where you are.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor775"></a>
 Have I given clear feedback on the problem?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Being crystal clear about severe problems has two benefits. First, you ensure there are no misunderstandings. Second, you can reassure other people on the team that they would know if they were at risk of being fired.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Firing one employee can impact the feeling of security that other employees have, particularly if it <span class="CharOverride-1">feels</span>
 like the firing is the result of one bad decision or conflict. Whenever an employee is fired, other employees start to wonder if they could be next. By using clear language and giving people early warning, you can reassure other teammates that they won&apos;t be caught by surprise if they ever run into issues.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Hopefully, it shouldn&apos;t be a total surprise that things aren&apos;t going well, although perhaps the employee didn&apos;t realize that it&apos;d gotten to <span class="CharOverride-1">that</span>
 point yet. It&apos;s useful to be explicit that, yes, it has gotten there.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here&apos;s an example of how to word it:</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">Your current performance is not meeting expectations for this role. We need to see major improvements in the next 30 days or you won&apos;t be able to stay in this role at the company.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You can then work on a plan for the improvements you need to see and how to get there.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor776"></a>
 Do they really want to improve?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The only way performance problems get resolved is if the person really wants to improve.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Often, <a id="_idIndexMarker586"></a>
 underperformance is a symptom of the employee already being disengaged. Talk to them and see if you can figure out what&apos;s behind that disengagement. Is there a root cause that&apos;s solvable?</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">If they don&apos;t want to improve, they won&apos;t. By the time you feel that they&apos;re missing expectations, you&apos;ve probably already given them feedback several times.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">

 They might deny the problem or feel defensive. They might externalize the problem and try to put the blame onto someone else. In these cases, it&apos;s unlikely things will get better and you should arrange a departure quickly.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">On the other hand, if they hear your feedback and jump into action, taking full responsibility for the problem, that&apos;s a good sign. If they appreciate your feedback and start planning how to address it, they might be able to turn the situation around.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor777"></a>
 Is there a different role where they&apos;d be likely to succeed?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Sometimes underperformance comes when there&apos;s a mismatch with the current role. You don&apos;t want to pass a problem on to someone else, but if you truly believe they would thrive in another role, it can make sense to work on that transfer, rather than losing them entirely.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Perhaps they&apos;d do better with a different set of people, or as part of a team with a different culture. Maybe they would improve with a mentor they have more in common with. If you move them within the PM team, you also have the benefit of starting them fresh on a project with tighter expectations so you can get things off on the right foot.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor778"></a>
 Where is your time and energy best spent?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As a manager, it can be tempting to spend your time and energy trying to save an underperforming report. Unfortunately, that usually means taking that valuable attention away from your other reports who might benefit more. It will be more impactful to put your time into your best people.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Imagine the best-case scenario where your extra energy helps get the person back on track. Are they now one of the best people on your team? Are they better than the replacement you could hire?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Dealing with someone who is underperforming is a drain. It won&apos;t only be tough on you, but also on that person&apos;s teammates. Most managers say that they waited too long to fire an underperformer.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor779"></a>
 Now what? (How to let go)</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Perhaps it&apos;s come to the point where you&apos;ve realized that, for whatever reason, your struggling employee must move on. What do you do?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In the US, Europe, and many other areas, firing an employee has significant legal complications.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">

 Doing the wrong thing can open you up to lawsuits.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This is where you need to get others involved, often your manager and the HR department. Larger companies have likely established a procedure for this, and it&apos;s important that you discover what it is.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This procedure might involve a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) and legal documentation. At a very small company, it might be much more informal—a conversation, some severance, and they&apos;re on their way.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">These policies can vary greatly across companies, due to company culture and legal restrictions. Don&apos;t fire until you understand how to do so. And, ideally, you should have been gathering this information much earlier.</p>

 Key Takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Build a strong relationship with your reports</span>
 : Make sure they believe that you have their best interests at heart. Don&apos;t skip 1:1s. You can&apos;t coach someone who doesn&apos;t trust you.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Managing PMs is especially difficult because of how autonomous they are</span>
 : You won&apos;t know how well your reports are doing unless you seek out that information and encourage them to share their challenges with you.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Make sure your reports are clear on the top areas they need to develop to achieve their goals</span>
 : People aren&apos;t especially great at hearing developmental feedback. Learn what your reports want to achieve, match that against business needs, and then ensure they understand which areas are the most important to focus on. This is especially important if they are underperforming.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Match people to projects that will develop their skills</span>
 : The main way PMs grow is through the work they do. When possible, match people to the teams or projects that will be a small to moderate <a id="_idIndexMarker587"></a>
 stretch for them.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Get your reports the compensation and promotions they deserve</span>
 : It takes real work to advocate for your reports and ensure they get the recognition they deserve. Take the time to learn the system and search for the information you need to make your case.</li>

 .	If the employee was hired in the US, their paperwork likely says that they are &quot;at-will&quot; and specifically indicates that the employee can be terminated for essentially any reason at essentially any time. While that&apos;s technically true, that doesn&apos;t preclude the worker for suing you for some (actual or perceived) wrongdoing. This is why the legal implications are complex.</span>
