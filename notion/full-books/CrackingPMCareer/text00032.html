<p class="First-Paragraph---Main-Book">
<span class="AllCaps-Bold _idGenCharOverride-1">To those outside</span>
 of tech, the product manager role can be very confusing. &quot;What do you mean the engineers don&apos;t report to you?&quot;, they exclaim. &quot;Can&apos;t you just tell them what to do?&quot;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">To be fair, I was similarly confused at first. I imagined that without the authority to tell my teammates what to do, they might just refuse to do any work and spend the day playing solitaire instead. I quickly learned that my fears were unfounded. My teammates were just as eager as I was to launch great products that delighted customers and helped our company succeed. And, while playing solitaire all day might be tempting, they did still have their own boss keeping them <a id="_idIndexMarker466"></a>
 accountable.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">What I learned is that I shared most of the same high-level goals as my teammates and partners. They <span class="CharOverride-1">wanted</span>
 me to learn about our customers, think through product decisions, and propose the directions that would make our product successful… after thoroughly understanding their constraints and concerns. They didn&apos;t <span class="CharOverride-1">have</span>
 to listen to me, but I could make them <span class="CharOverride-1">want</span>
 to listen.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">That is the essence of influencing without authority, and it&apos;s a core part of the PM&apos;s job—whether that PM is an intern, a fresh grad, or a very senior PM.</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">You can&apos;t make the senior engineer take her time to build a feature, just because you said so.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">You can&apos;t make the legal team agree to extra risk, just to ship your product.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">You can&apos;t make the designer change the button text, just because that&apos;s your opinion.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">And if you <span class="CharOverride-1">try</span>
 to order everyone around, the <a id="_idIndexMarker467"></a>
 relationship will quickly become dysfunctional, if not non-existent.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Instead...</p>
<ul>
<li class="Text-Left ParaOverride-1">Maybe you can bring the senior engineer along on a customer visit, so she can see for herself how much the feature would delight customers?</li>
<li class="Text-Left ParaOverride-1">Maybe you can include the lawyers in team meetings at the beginning of the project so they feel like part of your team and then want to help with the launch?</li>
<li class="Text-Left ParaOverride-1">Maybe you can share your facts and frameworks with the designer, so your opinion isn&apos;t &quot;just an opinion&quot;?</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Everything you achieve happens because you persuaded someone else to go along with your plan. You convince teammates to go along with your product decisions. You convince executives to fund your team and approve your launches. None of them are going to do something just because you said so.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Luckily, there are many ways to exert your influence even when people don&apos;t report to you. In fact, you&apos;ll find you use these same skills even when people <span class="CharOverride-1">do</span>
 report directly to you. Ordering people around isn&apos;t a healthy way to accomplish your goals.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">True leadership is when people <span class="CharOverride-1">want</span>
 to follow.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor569" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Responsibilities</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor570"></a>
 Build <a id="_idIndexMarker468"></a>
 relationships</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Many cultures have a complicated view of relationship-building. Friendships? Sure, that&apos;s good. Networking? Eek. That seems shallow, perhaps even seedy—like something a salesperson would do to manipulate others. Connections? Well, that&apos;s just unfair!</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In reality, these are all different aspects of the same concept: <span class="CharOverride-1">relationships</span>
 . It&apos;s easy, particularly earlier in your career, to assume that the best idea should just win, and it shouldn&apos;t matter who you know.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In reality, people just don&apos;t have enough time, energy, and <a id="_idIndexMarker469"></a>
 trust to treat everyone as well as they treat the people they know and like. That doesn&apos;t mean they&apos;ll treat strangers poorly, but they might roll out the red carpet for friends.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">Good work relationships make everything easier. Teammates who trust you won&apos;t make you spend as much time justifying your decisions. Partners are more willing to assist you or take on risk. Mentors will take the time to share advice with you, and hiring managers will bring you onto their teams.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I first learned how much relationships mattered during a big launch at Google. I had followed the launch checklist and filled out the forms to get approval from each of the partner teams. One infrastructure team let me know that I&apos;d have to wait a month for my change to roll out through all the systems; my launch was going to be delayed!</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I shared the bad news with my manager who told me, &quot;Oh I know someone on that team, I&apos;ll talk to them!&quot; Lo and behold, the infrastructure team was able to fast track our changes and we made our date. I hadn&apos;t even known that fast tracking was a possibility.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Building those work relationships is simple. You don&apos;t need to be best friends—just friendly and respectful to colleagues. If you&apos;re already working with someone, invite them for a &quot;getting to know you&quot; conversation over coffee or tea—or just a walk around campus. If you&apos;d like to expand the number of people you know across your organization, consider joining a group or extracurricular, such as a diversity and inclusion group, sports team, or another shared interest group.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor571"></a>
 Earn <a id="_idIndexMarker470"></a>
 credibility</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Credibility is key for product managers. People are open to our influence if they <a id="_idIndexMarker471"></a>
 trust our judgment. They need to believe that when we ask them to do something, we know what we&apos;re talking about, and that it&apos;s in their best interest as well.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Credibility also helps you earn <a id="_idIndexMarker472"></a>
 autonomy. No matter how good you are at your job, you won&apos;t get more responsibility or more permission to work independently if people don&apos;t trust you. They&apos;d worry that they&apos;d have to clean up your messes.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It takes time to build credibility. More than anything else, your reputation as a PM will come from working on great products and having successful launches. But, beyond just doing your job well, there are ways to build credibility faster:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Articulate your</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-2"><a id="_idIndexMarker473"></a>
</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-2">frameworks</span>
 : When people understand the reasoning behind your decisions, they feel reassured that your decision-making process is sound.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Strike the sweet spot of confidence</span>
 : If you don&apos;t seem to trust yourself, other people won&apos;t trust you either. On the other hand, if you act more confident than warranted, you&apos;ll lose credibility.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Do what you said you&apos;d do (and make sure they know it)</span>
 : Reliability is a great way to earn credibility. Write down your plans and celebrate when you achieve them.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Note that credibility is relative to your level. Just because you&apos;re junior doesn&apos;t mean you can&apos;t have credibility—you can, but it&apos;s relative to the expectations of a junior PM. Likewise, very senior PMs can sometimes lack credibility, if they aren&apos;t meeting—or exceeding—the expectations of that level.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor572"></a>
 Drive decisions</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A top complaint engineering managers have about their PMs is that the PM doesn&apos;t drive decisions well. They talk about PMs who bubble every decision up to the CEO, or who get people together into a room but don&apos;t steer the conversation. They&apos;re bothered by PMs who let decisions linger unresolved for days or weeks, or who act unilaterally and exclude their teammates.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There are a few key elements to driving decisions well.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor573"></a>
 Take responsibility for making the decision</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Great PMs are proactive about identifying places where a decision needs to be made. They don&apos;t procrastinate on decisions or hope someone else will take the lead.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Even when other people have more expertise, the PM should play an active role and form their own point of view.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">Listen to the experts, write out the arguments on a whiteboard, and look for missing information or contradictions. Do your own research if necessary. Identify the criteria that different people are using to arrive at decisions, and then drive a discussion on how the criteria should be weighed against each other.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It&apos;s important to take the time to learn what other people know and think. If they know something you don&apos;t, it won&apos;t make sense for them to trust you with the decision. You want people to feel like you&apos;re all on the same team working towards shared goals.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You&apos;re responsible for understanding and synthesizing all of the different points of view. You&apos;ll need that to have the courage to make tough calls.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor574"></a>
 Assert your decisions tactfully</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Decision-making by consensus sounds nice and egalitarian, but in practice it&apos;s terrible. When you insist on discussing until everyone agrees, discussions often persist well beyond the point of diminishing returns. People argue until exhaustion. The winner is whoever can argue the longest, regardless of the merits of their side.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Instead, you need to judge when the discussion has gone on long enough, and then assert your decisions. If you&apos;re too indirect, people might not realize that you&apos;re stating a decision rather than just sharing an idea. If you&apos;re too assertive, it might sound dictatorial.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here&apos;s an approach that balances both sides:</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">In service of moving fast, I&apos;d like to make a decision here. This is a product decision and falls to the PM, so I&apos;d like to move forward with (insert decision here). Does that sound okay to everyone, or would anyone like to escalate?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This approach works because it:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Emphasizes the importance of making a decision rather than continuing to discuss</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Clarifies why you should be the person to make the decision</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Makes it clear that this is a decision, not just an idea</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Avoids sounding dictatorial by checking if it&apos;s okay, and giving people an option to disagree</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Discourages unimportant disagreement by raising the stakes from &quot;continue to argue with me&quot; to &quot;escalate to our bosses&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you worry there are some lingering hurt feelings after this, you can pull these people aside to chat one-on-one. The purpose of this is to smooth things over with the person and let them know you heard them, and not to resurface their opposition.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor575"></a>
 Move quickly</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Wasting too much time making a decision is often worse than making the wrong decision. There&apos;s a trap called analysis paralysis, which is when you get stuck overthinking and overanalyzing and never make a decision.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Great PMs need to make decisions with incomplete information. They show good judgment in moving faster on decisions that are easier to reverse. They understand that unresolved decisions take a toll on the team.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Sometimes, you&apos;ll need to escalate to make sure the decision is resolved quickly enough.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Before you escalate, make sure you&apos;ve done your homework:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Clarify the decision that needs to be made.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Determine the tradeoffs and the conflicting goals.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Try to drive agreement on which goals are more important.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The best way to escalate is to ask for a decision on which goal is more important, not the specifics of the solution. This approach works not only because the person you escalate to knows more about how the goals should be prioritized, but they usually are not close enough to the details to be the expert on the specific decision. They can provide context for you, and with that context, you&apos;ll be able to make a good decision.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor576" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Growth Practices</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor577"></a>
 Choose the right time to share your ideas</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A good idea can have a huge impact at the right time, but can be seen as an annoyance at the wrong time.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Pay attention to the planning cycles and product life cycle to get the timing right.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">For example, if you want to pitch an idea that would involve spinning up a new team, you probably don&apos;t want to do this just before your company&apos;s busy season. You might have more success right before new grad engineers join at the end of the summer, or when a big project is finishing up.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Or, if you want the marketing team to take on some extra work, find out when they do their planning and pitch your idea to them at that time.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor578"></a>
 Include people in the creation to get their buy-in</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There&apos;s a psychological effect where people are more attached to things they create themselves. You can use this to your advantage by including your <a id="_idIndexMarker474"></a>
 stakeholders in the creation of products, processes, and plans.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here are some tips for including teammates, while still retaining enough influence over the final decision:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Hold an early kickoff meeting</span>
 . People enjoy being included early because they get to shape the direction, and it won&apos;t be too late to include any of their ideas. You don&apos;t need to commit to any decisions early on, so you still have time to regroup if the ideas are very different from what you were expecting.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Structure the meetings to get the kind of input you want</span>
 . Organize the questions and topics to help guide people to the types of feedback and solutions you want.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Host a brainstorming session</span>
 . Brainstorming is a great way to solicit ideas without being obligated to use them. See <a href="text00012.html#_idTextAnchor198">&quot;Brainstorming&quot; in Chapter 7</a>
 for tips on how to run a great brainstorming session.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Allow other people to get the credit</span>
 . It might be tempting to share your ideas first so you get the credit for them, but you&apos;ll have more influence if you allow other people to feel like they thought of the ideas themselves.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Draft the solution by yourself, or in a much smaller group</span>
 . Once you&apos;ve received input from everyone, it is usually more efficient to come up with the actual solution draft on your own or with a small group. Make sure to draw as many connections to other people&apos;s contributions as possible.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Frame it as a team solution</span>
 . Throughout the process, make sure to refer to the solution as belonging to the whole team, not just yourself. Use words like &quot;our&quot; instead of &quot;my,&quot; and help everyone feel ownership and pride in the overall success.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Remember that, at their core, nearly everyone wants to feel important and impactful. Leverage this by giving people an opportunity to feel this way.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor579"></a>
 Build cross-departmental trust <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Product teams can get a bit elitist and dismissive of other departments like sales, support, or marketing. This breeds distrust; people in those departments think that product teams don&apos;t really understand how the business is run.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As you advance in your career, it becomes even more important to understand and represent the whole company, not just your team. You&apos;ll need to earn the trust of the executive team, and earning the trust of the department leads who report to those executives is a good way to do that.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you invest the time to learn about other departments and understand their concerns, they&apos;ll see you as an ally and be less skeptical of your solutions. Ask them what&apos;s most important to them. See if they have any concerns about how they&apos;ve worked with product managers in the past. Then, share what your team is working on. You can even hold Q&amp;A sessions or present what your team is working on at their all-hands.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor580" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Concepts and Frameworks</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor581"></a>
 <a id="_idIndexMarker475"></a>
 Stakeholder management</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Few words strike fear into the hearts of PMs like &quot;Stakeholder Management.&quot; You need to deal with many people with different contexts, goals, experiences, and risk tolerance—each of whom can block your progress. Somehow, you&apos;re supposed to make them all happy and keep them all informed, on top of your day-to-day work.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A structured approach can help.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor582"></a>
 Step 1: Deeply understand your stakeholders and their goals</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Start by understanding where each of the stakeholders are coming from. Learn as much as you can about their priorities, goals, and fears.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">People managers and executives often care about goals that go beyond the product. They&apos;ll care about the potential impact on recruiting, morale, or financials. People who work in operations have their own sets of concerns that come from managing a large team of sales or support people.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If their goals or concerns don&apos;t make sense to you, ask yourself, &quot;What would I have to believe to come to those same concerns? Under what circumstances would they be right?&quot; This often directly points to data analysis or user tests that can validate the assumptions.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Later in the process, when you&apos;re trying to make a decision, bring the conversation back to the goals that you learned in this step.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor583"></a>
 <a id="_idTextAnchor584"></a>
 Step 2: Clarify the decision-maker and other roles</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It can feel scary to clarify who is the decision-maker when you worry that multiple people believe they hold that responsibility. But in practice, this is a critical step, and it&apos;s always better to bring it out into the open.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In addition to the one decision-maker, it is also essential to determine the roles of the other members in the group. Are there other people who can give blocking feedback? Are the rest of the people just advisors? You can formalize this with the <a id="_idIndexMarker476"></a>
 DACI/<a id="_idIndexMarker477"></a>
 RACI model:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Driver / Responsible</span>
 : The person or people running the process</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1"><a id="_idIndexMarker478"></a>
 <span class="CharOverride-2">Accountable / Approver</span>
 : The final decision-maker, or the person who must agree to the final decision</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Consulted</span>
 : People who are included in the decision-making process, with two-way communication</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Informed</span>
 : People who are kept up-to-date on progress, with one-way communication</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There may be some negotiations involved during this step. People who you want to keep informed might prefer to be consulted. It helps to get advice from your manager or a PM who&apos;s been at the company for a long time; they&apos;ll know which people are really important to include and how much inclusion is expected at the company.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor585"></a>
 Step 3: Explain the process and communication plan</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">One of the big ways stakeholder management goes astray is when people aren&apos;t sure about the timeline and when they&apos;ll get updates. By laying out a plan, you earn trust and save yourself from lots of questions.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When you have a long-running process, you&apos;ll want to make sure you have a plan for <a id="_idIndexMarker479"></a>
 status updates. Let people know when to expect them, for example, weekly or bi-weekly. When you are reliable with communication, it takes the burden of tracking the status off of them. If anything major changes in the plan, be sure to update people promptly.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">See <a href="text00017.html#_idTextAnchor281">&quot;Write good status reports&quot; in Chapter 10</a>
 for tips on how to write a good status report.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor586"></a>
 Step 4: Make each stakeholder feel heard</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">After uncertainty, the next biggest problem with stakeholder management is when people don&apos;t feel heard. And yes, feeling heard is different than being heard; you need to reflect what you&apos;ve heard back to the stakeholder until they believe you fully understand them.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-001-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00032.html#endnote-001">1</a>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A nice way to do this is to go around the room and ask each person for their thoughts, while you take notes and project them. Let people see that you&apos;re capturing their points, and let them confirm that you wrote them down accurately.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Miscommunication is common in stakeholder management, because stakeholders come from outside of the team and have less shared context. You might use a word differently than they do. It can help to reflect what you heard in your own words to ensure you&apos;ve understood correctly.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor587" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Key Takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Learn what people care about before you try to influence them</span>
 : People are only open to your influence if they believe you understand them and care about their needs. Learn about their job, goals, and worries. Reflect back to them. This is the foundation on which you&apos;ll convince them that your ideas are good for them as well.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Listen to your teammates, but don&apos;t always wait for consensus</span>
 : Including your teammates in product decisions is great, but sometimes you need to step up and make a decision, even when there&apos;s still disagreement. Sometimes, you&apos;ll really need full buy-in from everyone, but often you can encourage people to defer to you for the sake of speed.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Timing Matters</span>
 : Teams have planning cycles, and it&apos;s a lot easier to convince a team to consider something new when you catch them in the right part of the cycle. Sometimes you&apos;ll seed an idea early and nurture it over months or years before people feel open to it. Don&apos;t lose hope just because you get an early &quot;no.&quot;</li>
