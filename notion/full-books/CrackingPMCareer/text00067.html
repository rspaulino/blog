<p class="First-Paragraph---Main-Book">
<span class="AllCaps-Bold _idGenCharOverride-1">One of the</span>
 great things about product management is that it&apos;s very supportive of generalist PMs. Many product managers switch to a different type of PM role with every new job, from consumer to enterprise, e-commerce to <a id="_idIndexMarker908"></a>
 marketplace, growth to machine learning, and big company to startup.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Switching types is welcomed because these PM types share almost all the same skills, and those skills generally drive success more than specialized knowledge. Moreover, switching types can actually be <span class="CharOverride-1">positive</span>
 , as many big contributions come from cross-pollination: applying an idea from one type of team to another.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The main exception to the &quot;generalist&quot; rule is when you have the chance to become a leading expert—one of the people with the most or best experience in that specialty. For example, when the iPhone app store opened in 2008, it brought in a new age of mobile apps. PMs with a few extra years of mobile expertise became highly desirable.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">With that in mind, we&apos;ll dig into how various PM roles differ, and what skills are especially important for each.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1166" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <a id="_idIndexMarker909" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Consumer</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1167"></a>
 What It Is</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Consumer PM roles are often the first ones people think of when they think of product management. They work on user-facing features for products that target everyday people, such as Spotify, Instagram, Reddit, YouTube, Google Maps, Yelp, or TikTok. Many PMs choose to work in a consumer role because they love the product.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1168"></a>
 What You Do</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Consumer PMs usually focus on success metrics measuring <a id="_idIndexMarker910"></a>
 engagement: getting people to use and keep using the product. This might be measured by <a id="_idIndexMarker911"></a>
 Daily Active Users (DAUs) or Monthly Active Users (<a id="_idIndexMarker912"></a>
 MAUs), or even the ratio of DAU/MAU to track increasing frequency of use in a large and growing user base. Entertainment products often use &quot;time spent&quot; metrics such as minutes listening. PMs might also own usage metrics or transactional metrics for their specific area, such as messages sent or reviews written.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1169"></a>
 What You Need</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Product skills such as customer focus, design, and <a id="_idIndexMarker913"></a>
 creativity are especially important for consumer PMs. Consumer-facing products often have heavy competition, and consumers will choose the products where they see compelling value and enjoy the design. Consumer PMs must constantly consider their users, what problems they have, and how to solve those problems in a way that will work for millions of users.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Strong product intuition, customer research, and data analysis skills help you make sure your product works for the &quot;<a id="_idIndexMarker914"></a>
 silent majority&quot; and keep you from getting misled by the &quot;<a id="_idIndexMarker915"></a>
 vocal minority.&quot; For consumer apps, the few users who post on the forums every day and send in feature requests often (the vocal minority) don&apos;t have the same needs and use cases as the rest of your users (the silent majority). Often, the loudest users want fancy functionality for their niche use case, while typical users would benefit more from usability improvements and easy-to-use features. Great consumer PMs can look at data to find and advocate for big product opportunities.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-001-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00067.html#endnote-001">1</a>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When your <a id="_idIndexMarker916"></a>
 target users are everyday people, everyone has opinions on what you should do. There is no shortage of ideas, but prioritization and the ability to say no become very important. Engineers and designers often run the show at consumer products, so you&apos;ll also need top notch collaboration and leadership skills to have an influence.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1170" style=";color:black;"></a>
 B2B</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1171"></a>
 What It Is</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><a id="_idIndexMarker917"></a>
 Business-to-business (B2B) products are focused on selling software to businesses, schools, or people at work. This includes products such as Adobe Creative Cloud, Asana, Dropbox, Google AdWords, Gusto, Jira, MailChimp, Microsoft Office, Salesforce, Shopify, Slack, Square, Workday, Zendesk, and Zoom.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1172"></a>
 What You Do</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">While B2B products often don&apos;t have the same name recognition and prestige as consumer products, they&apos;re a great place to be a product manager. You build a product or service that people find valuable, and they pay you for it. It&apos;s relatively straightforward to learn about what customers want from your product, and to know that you&apos;re delivering real value. Unless engineers or designers are the <a id="_idIndexMarker918"></a>
 target customer, the team usually relies heavily on the PM to understand customer needs.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">B2B product managers often focus on <a id="_idIndexMarker919"></a>
 success metrics that measure revenue: getting people to pay and continue to pay. This might be measured by new sales deals your features helped close, annual recurring revenue (ARR), or active premium users, especially with a focus on <a id="_idIndexMarker920"></a>
 retention and <a id="_idIndexMarker921"></a>
 churn. At a zoomed-in level, PMs often focus on <a id="_idIndexMarker922"></a>
 engagement with their features.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1173"></a>
 What You Need</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As a B2B PM, it&apos;s critically important to think about multiple users—the people who purchase or administer the software often have different needs than the people who use the software. Great products need to consider all of the users. PMs sometimes focus only on what the purchaser wants and end up building poorly designed software that makes the end users miserable. Don&apos;t be that PM!</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><a id="_idIndexMarker923"></a>
 Strategic skills like market analysis and understanding business models are especially important for B2B product managers. PMs need to figure out what it takes to close deals, beat the competition, expand the market, and balance investments across many competing priorities. Unlike some consumer PMs, B2B PMs don&apos;t have the luxury of ignoring monetization.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Mike Ross, Senior Director of Product Management at Skydio, explains:</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">My job is twofold. The first part is to ship quickly and get feedback: ship quality products, fast; scope them appropriately; and start the iteration loop. The second part is to influence the pipeline. To push the envelope on who we can sell to. To go build the largest market that I can for our product. That involves talking to folks that are on the edges of our boundaries and understanding where the deltas are, and then going and closing those gaps so that we can continue to grow.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Great B2B PMs spend a lot of time with customers and find the connections between customer needs and business opportunities.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1174" style=";color:black;"></a>
 E-Commerce</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1175"></a>
 What It Is</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">E-commerce companies sell things online (and usually deliver them in the real world). This includes websites such as Amazon, Alibaba, Flipkart, Walmart, and Zappos.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1176"></a>
 What You Do</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Unlike many modern tech companies, where everyone is inventing best practices on the fly, e-commerce companies build on the fundamentals of supply chain management.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Rahul Ramkumar, VP of Product Management at Walmart, explained:</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">The backbone of e-commerce is the supply chain—you can have a beautiful site, a fantastic experience; you can take the orders. But ultimately, you&apos;ve got to fulfill those orders and deliver them on time. If you don&apos;t do that right, they&apos;re not going to come back.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Alongside studying the supply chain, he recommends joining a rotational program where you can spend time managing merchandising, answering support tickets, or joining any other team that touches the customer&apos;s order to get the 360-degree view. If that is not an option, he recommends seeking out mentors within the organization.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The main <a id="_idIndexMarker924"></a>
 success metric at e-commerce companies is usually successful orders. Leading up to that is the conversion funnel: visiting the site, viewing a product, adding it to the cart, checkout, and, finally, purchasing.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1177"></a>
 What You Need</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The top skills for e-commerce PMs vary by part of the company, but execution skills tend to stand out. E-commerce is a complex system where all the pieces need to work together, and mistakes can have more severe repercussions since you&apos;re often dealing with physical goods and financial transactions.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1178" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <a id="_idIndexMarker925" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Marketplace</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1179"></a>
 What It Is</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Two-sided marketplace products connect buyers and sellers or service providers. This includes products like Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Airbnb, Etsy, Ebay, and Alibaba.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1180"></a>
 What You Do</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">PM roles on the buyer-side of the marketplace are often consumer or e-commerce roles. Roles on the seller-side are often B2B roles. However, great marketplace PMs are always thinking about the interplay between supply and demand. Many new features require work on both the buyer and seller side.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Marketplace PMs look at success metrics that track the overall health of the marketplace: supply, demand, and successful transactions (such as bookings or sales).</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1181"></a>
 What You Need</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><a id="_idIndexMarker926"></a>
 Strategic skills like business sense and collaboration skills (particularly between different teams) are critical in marketplace products.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1182" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <a id="_idIndexMarker927" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Gaming</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1183"></a>
 What It Is</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">While desktop and console games didn&apos;t historically have product managers, newer online and mobile games, especially free-to-play games, do. This includes games like Farmville, Candy Crush, Pokémon Go, Angry Birds, League of Legends, and Fortnite. Now that most games have an online component, even traditional game studios hire product managers.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1184"></a>
 What You Do</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">PMs at game companies usually focus on success metrics around the long-term value of players, such as <a id="_idIndexMarker928"></a>
 engagement and monetization. It&apos;s important to build a game that&apos;s appealing enough for people to come back, so metrics like D1 and D7 <a id="_idIndexMarker929"></a>
 retention (how many people come back after the first day and first week) matter a lot. Monetization might be measured by average revenue per daily active user (ARPDAU). Mobile games tend to acquire new users primarily through ads, so it&apos;s very important to compare the long-term value to the cost per install (CPI).</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Successful free-to-play games are built with the business model in mind from the beginning—it&apos;s not like consumer apps that can get away with first building a massive user base and then figuring out how to monetize them. The type of gameplay affects what types of monetization strategies will work—for example, paying to skip waiting, paying for cosmetic items, or paying for more powerful characters.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The PM works with the game designer to figure out both the core game and what gaming PMs call &quot;the metagame.&quot; The core game is the action of the game, like matching colors in candy crush, while the metagame is all of the surrounding elements, like progression and the game economy.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Games are designed to be live for much longer than they were in initial development, so most gaming PMs don&apos;t launch a brand new game. Instead, they&apos;re responsible for optimizing and improving a game after it&apos;s launched. This is called the live operations, or LiveOps phase. A gaming PM is constantly working on improvements, from adding new content, to building new types of gameplay, to optimizing the first-time experience. PMs spend a lot of time analyzing data on how new features are doing. If you don&apos;t already know <a id="_idIndexMarker930"></a>
 SQL, you&apos;ll be expected to learn it early on.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1185"></a>
 What You Need</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It takes a lot of people working together to create a game: artists, game designers, UI and UX designers, engineers, and so on. Some companies have dedicated project managers, but for those that don&apos;t, good project management to keep everyone aligned will be very important.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Beyond strong analytical skills, what does it take to be a great games PM? A lot of experience playing games! As Brian Shih, VP of PM at Pocket Gems, shared:</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">If you want to get really good at game design, the first thing I would tell you to do is go play 10,000 hours of video games, go play the top 10 games each for 1,000 hours and really, really understand them. Really feel what it&apos;s like to have empathy as a player for all the different systems, and to have references to draw on.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you love video games, being a gaming PM can be a dream come true.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1186" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <a id="_idIndexMarker931" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Platforms and <a id="_idIndexMarker932" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Infrastructure</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1187"></a>
 What It Is</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Platform PMs are responsible for foundational components that other people use to build products, such as APIs, UI widgets, or infrastructure components. Platforms can be internal-facing infrastructure (the customers are product teams at the same company) or external facing (providing functionality for developers at other companies to build on top of).</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A key difference between platforms and products is that products solve a known set of use cases directly, while platforms are meant to enable other teams to solve the use cases they choose.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1188"></a>
 What You Do</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As a platform PM, you&apos;ll need to think about at least two levels of customers: the developers using your platform and the end-users they serve. The level of indirection also adds uncertainty: The product teams might change their goals or have failed to communicate their full context.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Platform PMs generally try to measure platform health, such as the number of successful products using the platform. Ideally, the team can also measure the benefits for the product teams building on the platform, such as a decrease in development time or an increase in their key success metrics. A big part of being a platform or infrastructure PM is helping define the right success metrics for your team.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1189"></a>
 What You Need</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Since your customers are developers, technical skills such as a background in coding can be important. Just like consumer PMs spot usability bugs in a UI, platform PMs can spot usability bugs in an API. Technical skills are also important for imagining what might be possible in a platform, and understanding the opportunities and constraints.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Product skills are important for platform PMs to truly understand the use cases and choose coherent sets of functionality to launch. Without a PM, platform teams tend to launch a grab bag of APIs that mirror the internal code structure and that don&apos;t always enable important use cases. For example, a poorly designed API might be missing access to a key object or might require too many round trips to be fast enough for the desired use cases.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A great rule of thumb for platform PMing is to design around three different products you&apos;d like to see built on top of the platform. Choosing at least one ensures the platform will actually be useful, and expanding it to three helps illuminate areas where the platform needs to be flexible.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Strategic skills are also important for platform PMs; you need to be able to set a long-term roadmap based on what the products might need in the future. Unlike most online software, which can be regularly fixed through updates, platform mistakes (particularly externally-facing ones) often can&apos;t be easily fixed. If your changes aren&apos;t backward compatible, the products built on top of your product will break.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1190" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <a id="_idIndexMarker933" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Internal Teams</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1191"></a>
 What It Is</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">PMs for internal teams build products where the customers are other people at the company. This includes infrastructure teams, as well as teams building tools for salespeople, data scientists, customer support, and marketers at their company. It also includes tools to support the primary function of the company, such as tools for real estate agents at a real estate company, financial advisors at a finance company, healthcare advocates at a healthcare company, or journalists at a news company.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1192"></a>
 What You Do</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As an internal team PM, you need to work closely with your customers (other teams), executives, and the rest of the company. Often, there can be tension between the company leaders who spun up the team and the internal customers the team is supposed to help.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">For example, there might be a company-wide mandate for product teams to move onto common infrastructure, but each product team sees switching work as a pointless burden. You might be building a tool to assist an operations team in decision-making, but they&apos;re worried they won&apos;t have a job once your tool is implemented. The automation tool you build might take away all the easy work, leaving the operations team with only the stressful work.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Your job is to understand these conflicts, develop appropriate solutions, address the internal customer&apos;s concerns, and roll out solutions.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1193"></a>
 What You Need</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><a id="_idIndexMarker934"></a>
 Stakeholder management and relationship-building are critical skills for internal PMs. Great internal PMs tackle tension directly and show strong customer focus for their internal customers, rather than blindly following executive orders. They learn about the needs and fears of internal teams and come up with solutions that address them—even if that includes things that PMs don&apos;t typically do, such as suggesting new work an operations team can pursue after their current work is automated. They evangelize their work internally to help teams understand the benefits of switching over.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Strategic skills are also important for internal teams. These teams can often feel like they&apos;re at the whim of dozens of stakeholders with frequently changing requirements, and there are constant fires to put out. This makes it hard to launch anything, and hard to tell if your work is actually successful. Creating a clear mission and using it to prioritize the work can help teams get out of firefighting mode.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1194" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Hardware and <a id="_idIndexMarker935" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Internet of Things</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1195"></a>
 What It Is</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Hardware PMs focus on building and delivering physical products, and the Internet of Things (IoT) refers to products that combine hardware and software. This includes products like the iPhone, Sonos speakers, Nest cameras, and Fitbit trackers.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1196"></a>
 What You Do</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Instead of <a id="_idIndexMarker936"></a>
 A/B testing, hardware PMs rely a lot more on prototype testing and internal feedback on early prototypes (to avoid leaks). Even though PMs can test several prototypes with customers, it&apos;s harder to iterate on the fly. It&apos;s important to have strong hypotheses about what might go wrong so you can have the right backup prototype ready.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In terms of execution, hardware follows a fixed product development cycle with phases that go from initial concept to mass production. Hardware PMs need to learn about each phase, how long it lasts, and what kinds of changes are easy or hard to make during this phase. Laide Olambiwonnu, PM Director at Syng (and previously at Ring and Sonos) explains:</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">Be really critical about the goals and objectives of each build. This allows you to prioritize efficiently and ensure you get the most out of each build.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There are a lot of aspects of hardware PMing that software PMs never face. Hardware PMs often travel to visit the factories where their products are made or to visit vendors, which can be a pro or a con to the job, depending on how much you enjoy travel. Hardware PMs also are responsible for packaging and will consider things like the unboxing experience and sustainable packaging.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">For IoT, Daniel Elizalde writes:</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">The Internet of Things will require a new breed of product manager—one who can incorporate the five layers of the IoT technology stack into their product strategy and roadmap.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-002-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00067.html#endnote-002">2</a>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In his framework, the five layers are device hardware, device software, communication, cloud platform, and cloud applications.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1197"></a>
 What You Need</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Compared to software, hardware takes a lot of time and money to produce. This means that you&apos;ll need strategic skills (in predicting which way technology is moving), great product intuition (since you can&apos;t do mass A/B testing), and excellent execution (since problems can&apos;t be fixed as easily after you launch).</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you&apos;re working on a piece of hardware that will launch in three years, you need to be able to make good predictions about the future so that you&apos;re not stuck with choices that rapidly make your product obsolete. For example, some hardware products attached to the iPhone via the headphone jack, but when Apple dropped the headphone jack in 2016, the products were left scrambling for alternatives. Whoops!</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Olambiwonnu shares how she stays on top of which components to bet on:</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">Conferences like CES help a lot, as well as following organizational blogs for the big players, and subscribing to their email list. It&apos;s good to be in touch with their upcoming roadmap to make sure you&apos;re incorporating the best components that are going to be supported for a very long time by the component makers.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Keeping up-to-date with trends and technologies will help you develop hardware that feels perfectly modern—neither outdated nor ahead of its time.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1198" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Growth and Monetization</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1199"></a>
 What It Is</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Growth PM roles exist inside many company types and focus on acquiring or monetizing new users rather than on building new functionality. Growth PMs can work on all parts of the product, but often focus on key flows like signup or purchasing.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1200"></a>
 What You Do</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Growth PMs focus on what Bangaly Kaba calls the adjacent user, people who are aware of a product and may have tried using it, but are not able to successfully become an <a id="_idIndexMarker937"></a>
 engaged user.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-003-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00067.html#endnote-003">3</a>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As Kaba writes:</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">Our insight was that it is critical for growth teams to be continually defining who the adjacent user is, to understand why they are struggling, to build empathy for the adjacent user, and ultimately to solve their problems.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Growth PMs often directly own success metrics such as revenue or active users, and measure that success via A/B tests.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1201"></a>
 What You Need</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Analytical problem solving, data insight, and execution skills are especially important for growth PMs. Analytical problem solving helps you come up with hypotheses and ask the right questions. Data insight helps you size the opportunities and analyze experiment results. Flawless execution is particularly important when running experiments to test hypotheses, because you don&apos;t want to be in a situation where you&apos;re not sure if the result was because the hypothesis is wrong or because the execution was bad.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Depending on how established growth and monetization are at your company, you might need to help build the right culture for a growth team. Leadership skills will also be critical, as there are a lot of habits and values that need to be learned.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1202" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <a id="_idIndexMarker938" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Machine Learning, <a id="_idIndexMarker939" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Data</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1203"></a>
 What It Is</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Machine learning (ML) PM jobs tend to be highly technical roles. The PMs work with ML systems and data scientists to create better product experiences by applying pattern matching across big data sets. Machine learning can be used to improve ads, personalize content, recognize images, suggest products, and much more. While all PM roles have important ethical considerations, as an ML PM, it&apos;s especially important to think proactively about potential harms.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1204"></a>
 What You Do</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Machine learning PMs find ways to use data to solve customer needs. A PM might identify new use cases or <a id="_idIndexMarker940"></a>
 <a id="_idIndexMarker941"></a>
 target markets that the company&apos;s existing data could solve. They might investigate the output of machine learning algorithms to identify areas for improvement.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Navigating tradeoffs is a large part of the job. There are many types of machine learning models with different pros and cons, and each of them can be tuned in various ways. For example, one could improve recall (how many correct results the algorithm returns) at the expense of precision (how many incorrect results). The PM might be able to identify new features (signals) or sources of training data that improve both. Sometimes the PM recommends looking at <span class="CharOverride-1">less</span>
 data to get faster results when timeliness is important.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1205"></a>
 What You Need</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Machine learning PMs need to understand the technical capabilities and limitations, plus deeply understand the customer or business problem they&apos;re trying to solve to help guide the team to the right tradeoffs.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Beyond that, PMs need to be comfortable with data. For example, they may need to open up SQL to see what the raw data looks like, check for any problems, or just browse for potential inspiration.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Luckily, you don&apos;t need to go back to school to pick up the technical skills, as long as you have an interest in math and a willingness to learn. There are good online courses and articles about machine learning and data science to ramp up.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Because of the technical nature of the job, strong collaboration with engineers is also important. There are often multiple different technical approaches, each with different tradeoffs around cost and speed, or precision and recall.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Strategic skills can also be important. As Laura Hamilton, VP of Product at Rally Health explained:</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">You should have a data strategy and figure out what your <a id="_idIndexMarker942"></a>
 moat is.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-004-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00067.html#endnote-004">4</a>
</span>
</span>
 And how can you address it and expand it? If all of the data that you&apos;re using for your products is publicly available, it&apos;s not a very defensible business.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">

</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As the underlying machine learning algorithms become widely available and commoditized, finding good sources of data and identifying good features become more important differentiators.</p>

 <a id="_idIndexMarker943" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Startups</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1207"></a>
 What It Is</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">At most startups, one of the founders plays the role of the first PM. As the team scales, the startup may choose to bring on new PMs to help remove bottlenecks and free up the founders for more strategic work.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Joining a fast-growing startup can be amazing for your career as new opportunities arise and you&apos;re able to grow into roles that are larger than what you could get hired for externally. On the other hand, many startups don&apos;t have strong product leaders to learn from. Also, if the startup doesn&apos;t take off, it might be harder to find your next job than if you worked at a big name company.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1208"></a>
 What You Do</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Product managers at startups need to wear a lot of hats, juggle the extra complexities of working with the founders, and define the role.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The relationship with the product-focused founder is the trickiest and most important relationship for a startup PM. Early PMs sometimes come into a startup with an &quot;I&apos;m the CEO of the product&quot; mindset and can quickly butt heads with the founder who doesn&apos;t want to give up control of the product vision, or perhaps even the details of the product. At a startup with a strong product founder, new PMs often need to prove themselves with operational execution and polite advising before they slowly gain <a id="_idIndexMarker944"></a>
 strategic responsibility.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It&apos;s important to make sure you&apos;re very aligned with the founders before you join the company, or you&apos;ll find you won&apos;t want to stay long. First, you&apos;ll want to make sure you&apos;re strategically aligned and believe in the product vision. Then, make sure you&apos;re aligned with what they want from you as a PM. Some only learn after they join that the founder wanted them focused solely on execution, or that executives will make design-level tweaks to every feature.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A common challenge as an early PM at a startup is helping the rest of the team adapt to having a PM. Engineers or designers might worry that you&apos;ll take away their autonomy or add too much process. They might never have worked with a PM before and not know what to expect or when to loop you in. You&apos;ll need to show everyone how you can add value and help align expectations.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1209"></a>
 What You Need</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Networking is important for PMs at startups because you often can&apos;t rely on people inside your company for advice and mentorship. This especially comes into play when you pick up a task you&apos;ve never done before, like finding a coworking space, recording tutorial videos, planning a go-to-market campaign, hiring a user researcher, sending out a monthly newsletter, or running social media accounts. Luckily, people at startups tend to be very open to helping others and sharing what has or hasn&apos;t worked for them. When stuck, you can always ask the company&apos;s investors and advisors to help make introductions.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Execution skills, especially the ability to create lean <a id="_idIndexMarker945"></a>
 MVPs and test hypotheses crisply, are very important for startup PMs. Startups have limited resources; the quicker you can learn, the quicker you can make the right choices to achieve product market fit—hopefully before your startup runs out of money.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1210" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Regulated Industries</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1211"></a>
 What It Is</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">PM roles in a regulated industry like healthcare, payments, or financial services are very similar to other types of PMing, with a few extra tradeoffs. These industries are subject to government regulations that may add extra requirements to product work.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1212"></a>
 What You Do</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The benefit of working in a regulated industry is that you can have a significant impact on a very important part of people&apos;s lives. These companies are regulated precisely because of how important they are.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Mariano Capezzani, Group Head of Product at HSBC, explained what he loves about the role:</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">We have global reach, and the services and experiences that we build here enrich the lives of millions of people in the many communities that we serve across the world. Working here gives you the ability to meet customers, and meet the people that face these customers, all the way from Vancouver, Mexico, London, Dubai, to Hong Kong, Singapore, and Australia.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you join an older institution that&apos;s new to digital transformation, there&apos;s often an untapped wealth of information that can provide huge value and opportunities for innovation.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The tradeoff of working in a regulated industry is that there are more constraints, and things tend to move slower (often because of organizational complexity). You might need to work with your lawyer every day to deeply understand the nuances of regulations, the spirit of the law, and the regulatory environment. There will likely be many stakeholders and multi-step approval processes. You usually aren&apos;t able to quickly throw together an A/B test.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor1213"></a>
 What You Need</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Great PMs in regulated industries don&apos;t treat regulations like black and white checkboxes that they hand over to engineers. Instead, they get creative about how to meet customer needs and regulations at the same time. They understand the environment deeply so they can show good judgment on when to push the boundaries—for example, using e-signatures instead of handwritten ones.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Leadership skills are especially important in regulated industries, particularly in more mature, non-tech companies. PMs often need to convince multiple stakeholders to take a risk or change a process. There are multiple teams to align and drive meaningful conversations.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1214" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Non-tech Companies</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you work at a software or technology company, you&apos;re usually working in an environment where everyone already believes in the value of product management and customer-focused approaches. When you leave the tech world, there&apos;s an opportunity to bring best practices to other organizations, but it does entail extra work.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Alicia Dixon, who&apos;s worked as a senior product manager at hotel chains, shared:</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">I moved from software companies to companies where the tech is sold to compliment the core product. The key lesson I learned is that to be good at PM in those situations you have to excel at teaching others what you are doing and why you are doing it. Over communication is key.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A huge benefit of working at non-tech companies is flexibility of location. The top tech companies are mostly clustered in a few cities, but non-tech companies are everywhere. You also gain flexibility of product—there are many more businesses that don&apos;t center around software than those that do.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1215" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Government and Social Impact Organizations</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">PMs sometimes overlook government, nonprofits, and social impact organizations, but they can be a great place to work and make a difference in your community.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Michelle Thong, who led digital services for the city of San Jose, recommends taking a &quot;tour of duty&quot; in these areas:</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">If you&apos;re burnt out working in the tech industry and are looking for more mission driven work, a tour of duty in government could be really fulfilling. Your potential for impact is huge because you&apos;re taking a whole organization that is making a valuable contribution to society and helping them achieve better outcomes through product thinking. You may even end up choosing to stay in the public or non-profit sector as a long term career path, which will give you even more ability to enact positive change over time.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The tradeoff is that you need to put up with a lot of bureaucracy and scrutiny. You&apos;ll often be swimming against the tide as you try to transform an organization to be more customer centered.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">For more on government and social impact work, <span class="CharOverride-1">A Civic Technologist&apos;s Practice Guide</span>
