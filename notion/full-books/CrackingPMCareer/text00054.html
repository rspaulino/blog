<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1058" style=";color:black;"></a>
 How did you go from cycling to product management?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I was a professional athlete on the US Postal Service team with Lance Armstrong and I became a PM at Google in a non-traditional way. Joining Google was the perfect storm of being in the right place at the right time, and ultimately, paying attention to opportunities around me.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When I walked into my interview at Google in 2003, I told them:</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">Look, I have this history of being very successful at accomplishing big things. And I have a methodology for doing that. And I think that same methodology will apply at Google.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I knew, from a very early time, that I got a lot of personal satisfaction out of being methodical about doing things and preparing to deliver on big days or events. This idea that you show up on race day, and you have to perform under pressure—I applied that same methodology when I walked in the door at Google.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1059" style=";color:black;"></a>
 What did you do at Google?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Once I was at Google, every request to use Google&apos;s products or brand in anything would come to me for approval. As Google grew more popular, this became overwhelming and I realized that it was not a good use of my time. So, I put together a proposal on why we should program-itize the system. I submitted it, and I got approval to do so. All of a sudden, it was like, &quot;Okay, now you have the resources and the opportunity to do this. Go get it done.&quot;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">One particular request came from the CEO about a partnering opportunity with the movie, <span class="CharOverride-1">The Da Vinci Code</span>
 . Because it was a movie, and Marissa Mayer was known for spearheading movie outings for the company, she was also roped into it. We sat together to figure out what to do and decided to start a team. I sent an email to the internal movies mailing list and invited people to show up at a conference room at 10 AM if they wanted to work with us.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Ultimately, we built a series of puzzles that were contextually relevant to the Da Vinci Code, using things like the Fibonacci sequence. Because iGoogle was a really big, strategic priority for us at the time, we knew that this would be a great place to build it. We launched it and it was wildly successful.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">At the time, Google wasn&apos;t particularly adept at launching big things on a specific date—things where you flipped the switch and everything had to work. Sony was putting millions of dollars into marketing, so on the day that it launched, it had to work.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Marissa saw that I was good at getting a team of people to work on something very undefined and delivering on a launch date, so she invited me to join her team as a product manager. It was a pivotal moment in my career. I just took the opportunity, volunteered, and convinced a bunch of people to join me on this <a id="_idIndexMarker876"></a>
 <a id="_idIndexMarker877"></a>
 mission, and it all worked out.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1060" style=";color:black;"></a>
 How did you move from there to people management?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There was a call to employees—if you wanted to build an Android app, the company would provide you the time, resources, and assistance to do that. I signed up and found a couple of engineers that were interested in working on it with me.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">We built an app called My Tracks. It used My Maps, Google&apos;s custom map creator product, as a backend to track and record where you were going, using your phone. People generally used it for hiking, skiing, and cycling. It became really popular and eventually was folded into the Google Maps team as an official product.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">After that, my career started to grow. My role evolved from being an individual contributor to a people manager.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">The most challenging part for me was that, as a product manager, I essentially had all the details and numbers and the roadmap and the vision at my fingertips. But now as a people manager, I didn&apos;t know anything. It was a hard transition because I was so comfortable when I had all the details. I had to learn how to rely on others.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1061" style=";color:black;"></a>
 What was it like to be Head of Product at Path?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">While I was at Google, I met Dave Morin who started a company called Path. I had previously worked on real time search, leveraging the Twitter fire hose to build an index that could answer real time queries like &quot;traffic on 101.” I grew an affinity for &quot;social&quot; as a signal.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Path was a very intimate social network. Because it was 100% mobile, I had this vision of really increasing the <a id="_idIndexMarker878"></a>
 fidelity of the type of relationships that you could have online. There were twenty people when I joined, and I was the first product manager.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I felt like Path was that true, small startup experience where I walked into a whole bunch of chaos. There wasn&apos;t a shared language or a shared operating machine in place like we had at Google. I had to build it all from scratch.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">What I learned there is to never say, &quot;this is how we did it at company X.&quot; You just have to bite your tongue. It was really about going in and not saying anything for a month. Just quietly observe and really soak everything up that&apos;s going on in the organization.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1062" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Where did you focus your time at Path?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I knew I was going into an organization where the vision was already set. My job was really to try to bring order to the company.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">As head of product, I learned that it&apos;s not so much about owning the product roadmap; it&apos;s about owning the problem.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I was so focused on the end result of the journey we were on, that I didn&apos;t have the ego or confidence to think, &quot;I&apos;m the product manager; I should be able to make all of these decisions.&quot;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I went in and reorganized the way that we worked together. I helped the team create its first set of OKRs, because I needed the OKRs to then go and build the roadmap. I went through the different processes that would then lay the foundation to do the rest of the work. Then I hired a couple of product managers, and later a data science team. We evolved the way that design, product, and engineering all work together.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1063" style=";color:black;"></a>
 What were the important things you learned from that experience?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When you start to grow from one team to feature teams, having a shared language and shared rituals is so important. The whole idea behind product reviews or design reviews is to have a regular and predictable venue that people can count on to have a conversation.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Ultimately, we were stuck in a hard place. We had a hypothesis that the smaller and tighter you kept your social network, the better your experience would be—but this ran antithetical to &quot;grow as fast as you can.&quot; It was a really hard conflict for us to manage.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It ultimately became clear to me that we weren&apos;t going to have the outcome that we wanted and so I started looking around.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1064" style=";color:black;"></a>
 What was your time at Yahoo as VP of Platforms like?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Marissa joined Yahoo as the CEO right around the same time I was looking to leave Path. I wanted to work with her again, so I went to Yahoo. She told me that she knew exactly what team I should work on. I figured coming from Path, it would be the mobile team or some social project. I was really wrong!</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">She asked me to join the platform organization that runs underneath all of the product verticals. I didn&apos;t understand it at all. I&apos;m a mobile, social, consumer-facing, classic product manager. She just shook her head and laughed and said, &quot;No, no you&apos;re going to be great at this. This team needs a lot of guidance and direction and leadership, and you&apos;ll be great at it.&quot;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">What I discovered when I walked in was that the team was essentially operating in fire drill mode every day. It was just ad hoc development, ad hoc product planning, and ad hoc road mapping. There were 15 stakeholders saying that they all want a different thing, all on the same day. The end result of that mode is that you have a product that doesn&apos;t work very well. You have a team that is really unhappy. And you have a group of stakeholders who are equally unhappy because they think the platform organization is failing.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1065" style=";color:black;"></a>
 So how did you bring order to the chaos?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It took me about six months to really come up with a clear plan. I really needed that time and perspective to truly understand what to do. In the case of Yahoo, it was that we needed to get very, very clear about why we exist as a team. What&apos;s our purpose? What&apos;s our <a id="_idIndexMarker879"></a>
 mission?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">And not only is it important for that to be clear, but it&apos;s super important that everybody knows it and understands it. There&apos;s a maxim that if you don&apos;t say it ten times, it&apos;s not true. Say it a hundred times and then say it a hundred times more.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The reality is that while you may have a very clear picture of what the plan and the roadmap is, nobody else does. We would literally write it on the walls and on whiteboards and put it on T-shirts because it just was so critical for that team. We got really, really clear about what our mission was. We got really clear about who we were supporting and serving. In some cases, it was another product. In some cases, it was our own users. We got really clear on how to measure that and know if we&apos;re doing a good job. How do we know if all of the work that we did in a quarter actually accomplished what we needed to do for our customers&apos; business or the users?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I&apos;d tell the team that, if they&apos;re not working on something that is not directly related to one of these ten priorities on the whiteboard, to stop working on it. It empowered everybody to have a little more control over how they spent their days.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Another big part was communicating to the rest of the organization. As a platform team, I got everybody to take on a developer relations mentality of, &quot;You need to go out into the Yahoo internal ecosystem and evangelize what our platform does and why it&apos;s important for the people that are using it.&quot; I made a habit on Fridays to do a &quot;walk-around day&quot; where I&apos;d walk around buildings and talk to the people using our product.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1066" style=";color:black;"></a>
 How did the team react?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">One of the hardest changes for the team was not operating from a center of fear. This was a group of people that had become comfortable with losing. I changed this to say, &quot;No, no, you have to change your mentality to how we are going to win today. Let&apos;s take some risks. Let&apos;s be bold.&quot;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">To do that, you get some quick wins. You show progress. Get credibility. There&apos;s easy ways to do that. Be very clear about what you&apos;re going to do and how you&apos;re going to do it. Then remind everybody. And then remind them again.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">For example, every Friday, we had a meeting we called “<a id="_idIndexMarker880"></a>
 demos and drinks” that served a couple of different purposes. The demos got everybody to start showing what they were working on. That showed progress. It gave people the opportunity to get recognition along the way. It opened up the opportunity for collaboration. It also helped put people&apos;s feet to the fire a little bit. I&apos;d say &quot;Hey, I know you&apos;re working on something. I want to see it on Friday.&quot;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It also gave us the opportunity to remind people, &quot;Remember when we said we were going to do this? Well look, here&apos;s an example. We did it.&quot; We made a really significant habit out of celebrating all the little wins. As human beings, we have a tendency to not really recognize small accomplishments. Either we&apos;re afraid of bragging or we don&apos;t think they&apos;re big enough. Our team got maniacal about celebrating all those little wins. I think one of the interesting side effects of that kind of ritual is that we built up credibility, especially as a leadership team.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In a lot of ways, it was some of the most personally rewarding work that I&apos;ve done. We started in such a bad state, and it affected a whole team of people and the work they did every single day. We were able to turn that around.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1067" style=";color:black;"></a>
 What happened after Yahoo?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Over time, it became clear that Wall Street was not going to give Yahoo the time that we wanted to turn the company around. I realized it was a good opportunity for me to move on to the next chapter of my career. I left the company and didn&apos;t know where I was going to work next. I took my time to think carefully about it and talked to all of my friends and contacts. I interviewed at a million different companies.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Ultimately, I took a job at a company called Fair as Chief Product Officer. There was total chaos, but also really, really, fast growth and adoption. From a kind of product surface area, it was really interesting to me because it provided an opportunity for massive disruption. This was a company that was trying to disrupt auto sales and auto finance.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1068" style=";color:black;"></a>
 How did you spend your time at Fair?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I spent a lot of time in the beginning putting things in place, such as a career ladder, a process for performance reviews and promotions, a process for hiring and building teams, and an approach to organizing and managing the teams. I sat down with the executive team to come up with company OKRs, which I then used for my team to build our own OKRs, which then ultimately laid the foundation for performance reviews.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I fundamentally believed that the teams would operate better if all of those things were well defined. If it&apos;s not there, they spend their time thinking about, &quot;I want to move forward in my career. How am I going to be rewarded? How is what I&apos;m doing measured?&quot; rather than about how to build great products. The basics really matter.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It was also an opportunity to reinstate some of the lessons of the past which were: be really clear about what we&apos;re doing, make sure that we communicate dates, and—if we&apos;re going to miss a date—be proactive about communicating that. It was great to see how these practices really helped everybody move forward and evolve.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">At the same time, I had a side hustle with my former teammate Lance Armstrong to build a community for endurance athletes who really were energized by the idea that suffering has a purpose. It&apos;s a surprising phrase, but typically endurance athletes aspire to it. I worked in my spare time to help him build a company called WEDŪ (we do). It is the answer to &quot;Who wants to go ride 100 miles today?&quot; It just took off and has been really successful.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Most recently, I joined Goldman Sachs as CPO. My engineering counterpart at Yahoo joined as their CTO and I&apos;d wanted to work with him again for a while. A common theme throughout my career and the changes that I&apos;ve made is that there&apos;s always been somebody else I had faith in.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1069" style=";color:black;"></a>
 What advice do you have for PMs who want to succeed in their careers?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It&apos;s common to hear &quot;It&apos;s all about the people,&quot; but it actually really is.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Since very early in my career, even as an athlete, those relationships mattered. You&apos;re so dependent on those relationships, not just to be successful, but also to survive the day. My most inspiring memories and the things that I think about the most in the future are really about &quot;Who am I going to work with?&quot;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I&apos;ve definitely put a lot of effort into relationships. One example is I&apos;d go to company social events and ask people about what they&apos;re working on and the challenges they&apos;re facing. You learn so much more doing that than you do just talking about what you&apos;re working on, because you already know what you&apos;re working on.</p>
