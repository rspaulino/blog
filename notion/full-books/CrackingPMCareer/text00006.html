<p class="First-Paragraph---Main-Book">
<span class="AllCaps-Bold _idGenCharOverride-1">Claire showed up</span>
 at her new company ready to jump into action. Knowing how critical the first few months are, she wanted to show them that she could deliver an impact immediately. She wanted to get in some quick wins.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">On her first week, Claire asked her engineering teams to bring all of their in-progress work to her for review. She knew the CEO was concerned about product quality, so she carefully tried out the products, filed dozens of bugs, and made a handful of usability suggestions. &quot;Great!&quot; she thought, &quot;I&apos;m already making a difference.&quot;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Then, Claire moved on to the upcoming work. She walked over to her designer&apos;s desk and tapped him on the shoulder. &quot;Can you show me the mocks you&apos;re working on?&quot; she asked. She reviewed them quickly and said, &quot;Looks good! Can you please get me the final mocks by Friday.&quot; This team was really going to appreciate the way she ran a tight ship.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The next week, she was ready to present her spec for a new customer referral program, something she&apos;d implemented twice before at previous companies. People came after her with question after question. How will this work for anonymous users? Is this legal in the UK? Won&apos;t this hurt our margins? Do our power users like this approach? What did customers say? Honestly, she didn&apos;t know.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">After 30 days, when Claire got her first set of peer and manager feedback, she discovered that her &quot;tight ship&quot; was in shambles. Her teammates felt disrespected by the new processes, and frustrated that she hadn&apos;t protected them from the company&apos;s ever-changing requirements—which wasn&apos;t even on her radar. Her designer was frustrated by the constant interruptions and one-sided deadline setting. Her manager was disappointed that she hadn&apos;t spoken to any customers, and concerned that she hadn&apos;t submitted a roadmap yet—another task she was unaware of.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Ouch. Her eagerness gave way to impulsiveness, and she&apos;d flubbed her first 30 days. Luckily, she still had 60 days to get things back on track.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">She went back to each of her coworkers and apologized for rushing into things. &quot;Can we start over again? Nice to meet you. Can you tell me about yourself?&quot; She checked in with her teammates about what they were hoping she would work on. She met with her manager and wrote down a clear list of expectations, deliverables, and dates. Then she filled up her week with customer visits and spent her free time catching up on strategy documents and usage dashboards.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">By switching out of &quot;do, do, do!&quot; mode and into learning mode, she was able to build up the context about how to help her team and what the company needed. Her team let go of the earlier objections—an apology always helps—and she regained the <a id="_idIndexMarker018"></a>
 credibility she lost.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">With her relationships restored, she worked with her team to develop a roadmap and started using it to push back against changing requirements. By the end of her first 90 days she&apos;d launched several experiments to validate the team&apos;s direction, and was already delivering wins to customers.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">The first 90 days with a new team are crucial. Whether you&apos;re joining a large company or a small startup, this chapter will help you make the most of your first three months.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Overall, your goal for the first 90 days should be to set yourself up for long-term success on your new team. While it&apos;s beneficial to ramp up quickly and start delivering value early, you don&apos;t want to over-optimize on the short term. Some people mistakenly jump in and spend all their time finishing their first project quickly, instead of making space to learn the company and form strong relationships.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Take the time to lay the groundwork for the rest of your time on the team:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Learn about the company, your team, and cultural norms.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Learn about your product and customers.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Align on the expectations for your role.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Align on your onboarding plans and timeline with your manager and teammates.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Form strong relationships with coworkers.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Earn <a id="_idIndexMarker019"></a>
 credibility.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Get in some quick wins.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">On the flip side, don&apos;t stir up trouble before you understand the team dynamics. You&apos;ll need strong relationships to get your job done, so you don&apos;t want to alienate anyone early on. It&apos;s fairly common for an eager new PM to end up inadvertently stepping on toes.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor038"></a>
 The &quot;I&apos;m new here&quot; advantage</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There are huge advantages to being new on a team.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When you&apos;re new, you can ask lots of questions. Make the most of, &quot;Sorry, I&apos;m new here so could you explain what that means?&quot; or, &quot;I might not have the full context, but can you tell me more about why we&apos;re doing it that way?&quot; This applies to genuine questions, but it&apos;s also a powerful win-win technique for making suggestions in the early days.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Another advantage is starting relationships off on the right foot. There are a lot of &quot;getting to know you&quot; questions that are awkward to ask later on. If there&apos;s someone prickly who&apos;s had trouble with previous PMs, you can start out on the right foot with them.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Of course, being new also has disadvantages; you won&apos;t have earned <a id="_idIndexMarker020"></a>
 credibility yet, and that makes your job a lot harder. Don&apos;t worry—you&apos;ll earn it again!</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor039"></a>
 30/60/90 day onboarding plan</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In your first week or two, you&apos;ll want to put together an onboarding plan for your first 90 days and review it with your manager.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">The plan can be lightweight, but it helps to have something in writing when you&apos;re new. This is a key time when miscommunications or mismatched expectations tend to happen. Without a written plan, you might feel uncomfortable while ramping up, or your boss might think you&apos;re ramping up too slowly.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In creating your onboarding plan, ask for a list of people you should meet. Ask if there are specific topics you should discuss with them, and be sure to ask if there&apos;s any tension, conflict, or sore spots you should be aware of. The following list of people should get you started:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Immediate team: designer, engineers, data scientists, and user researchers</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Other PMs on your team</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Your manager&apos;s peers</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Key stakeholders</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Cross-functional partners: sales, marketing, operations, infrastructure, quality assurance, business development, content writers, legal, etc.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Anyone else who&apos;s generally good to know</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here&apos;s an example onboarding plan.</p>

<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor043"></a>
 Introductory meetings</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Introductory meetings are a great way to start forming relationships and get off to a good start with your coworkers.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Relationships will be critical to your success as a PM. It&apos;s a lot easier to lead people through influence if you can show them that you understand their goals and care about them as people. This might be as simple as asking them about their personal interests and sharing some of yours - bonus if you have some in common! You might also want to share a bit about your past experience to quickly earn some <a id="_idIndexMarker023"></a>
 credibility.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A second important goal of these meetings is to align on how you&apos;ll work together and how you&apos;ll split up the work. The PM role is a little different on each team, so you need to have a conversation about what is expected on this specific team.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor044"></a>
 Your <span class="CharOverride-2"><a id="_idIndexMarker024"></a>
</span>
 manager</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Your manager will be one of the most influential people in your career, so be sure to start off on the right foot. The more you understand them and what they care about, the better off you&apos;ll be.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Until you get to know your manager better, you can&apos;t go wrong by being friendly, curious, respectful, and enthusiastic to work with them.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You&apos;ll want to be completely aligned on expectations. Mismatched expectations are one of the top causes of failed <a id="_idIndexMarker025"></a>
 onboarding. If you&apos;re having trouble bringing it up, try printing out the list of questions and asking to go over them at your next 1:1. If your manager doesn&apos;t set up regular 1:1 meetings, schedule them yourself.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">About them:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">What is your working style?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">How would you like us to work together?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">How do you like to communicate; do you prefer written or in person?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Do you have any pet peeves? Any things you love?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">What are your top goals for this year?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">How can I best help you with your goals?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Is there anything else I should know about you?</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">About the role and expectations:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">How do you see my role?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">What makes a great PM?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">What does success look like to you?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Do you have thoughts on what I should be doing in my first 90 days?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Are there any important deliverables?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Is there a project I should get started on first?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">How much are you expecting me to shake things up in the beginning vs. execute on the current plans?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Are there any landmines or controversies to avoid?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Do you have any ideas for quick wins where I could help the team?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">When is my first feedback or review cycle? Is there anything specific you&apos;d like me to achieve by then?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Is there a job ladder or leveling framework I could read?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Are there any other expectations you have?<p class="BODY_Emphasis _idGenParaOverride-1">You&apos;ll learn a lot about your manager by what they emphasize in their responses. Pay attention to any key phrases they use or ideas they repeat.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Some people will emphasize numeric results, while others emphasize teamwork or learning. Some like to see a lot of autonomy, while others want to be kept looped into the details until you&apos;ve built up trust. Some care more about your relationship with the sales team, while others care more about your first-hand interactions with customers.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Be careful about how you talk about promotions and advancement. If you seem too focused on getting promoted, they might mistake you as being self-interested rather than user-focused or a team player.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor045"></a>
 Your <span class="CharOverride-2"><a id="_idIndexMarker026"></a>
</span>
 onboarding buddy</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Some companies will assign you an onboarding buddy. If not, you can ask your manager to recommend someone, or even approach someone directly. Ideally, your onboarding buddy is another PM on your team who has been at the company for a while. You want someone who knows how things work and won&apos;t judge you for asking questions. It&apos;s okay to have multiple onboarding buddies, for example, one person who&apos;s been at the company a long time, another who&apos;s on the PM team, and another who&apos;s eager to answer all your questions.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A great way to work with your onboarding buddy (especially a PM buddy) is to shadow them; sit next to them, ask them to invite you to their meetings, and have them loop you in on relevant communication. Ask them to talk out loud as they do their work—for example, explaining why they&apos;re answering a question in a certain way, sharing their tips for working with certain people, or explaining historical context about the product. By <a id="_idIndexMarker027"></a>
 shadowing them in this way, you&apos;ll be able to pick up context, processes, and cultural norms.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In addition to any of the questions from the Manager section earlier, you might also ask:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Text-Left ParaOverride-1">What should I know about my manager? Do they have any pet peeves? What&apos;s the fastest way to get on their good side?</li>
<li class="Text-Left ParaOverride-1">How do things actually get staffed and launched here? Who decides what&apos;s worked on? What kinds of approvals do people need?</li>
<li class="Text-Left ParaOverride-1">Do people really follow the official process? If they bend the rules, when and why?</li>
<li class="Text-Left ParaOverride-1">Are there any unspoken rules or cultural norms?</li>
<li class="Text-Left ParaOverride-1">Who are good role models?</li>
<li class="Text-Left ParaOverride-1">Are you in any fun groups or clubs at the company? Are there any you&apos;d recommend for me?</li>
</ul>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idIndexMarker028"></a>
 <a id="_idTextAnchor046"></a>
 Executives</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It&apos;s great if you can meet with some executives while you&apos;re onboarding. At a large company, this might be your skip-level manager. At a smaller company, this might be the cofounders.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In general, since this might be one of the few times you meet one on one with them, the most important thing is to make a good impression. It&apos;s also a good idea to start forming a mental model of their perspective so you&apos;ll be able to predict what they care about later on.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">An important part of making a good first impression is valuing their time. You don&apos;t want to ask informational questions that you could have looked up or should already know.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here are some safe questions for an intro meeting:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">How are you feeling about the company goals?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">What keeps you up at night?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">What&apos;s your biggest challenge right now?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Do you have any specific things you&apos;d like to see me do in this role?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">What&apos;s your view of what makes a PM successful at this company?</li>
</ul>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor047"></a>
 Close teammates</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">For your closest teammates, such as your designer and engineering lead, you&apos;ll want to start by building a relationship, then making sure expectations are aligned, and finally, looking for opportunities to help the team.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Setting expectations is especially important with close teammates because the boundaries of the PM role vary greatly from team to team. You don&apos;t want to get a few months in and realize that your designer expected you to be providing long written documents, or that your engineering lead wanted to write the tickets herself.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor048"></a>
 Getting-to-know-you questions:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Tell me about yourself. (Do you live near the office? Anything interesting going on outside of work? What do you do for fun? Do you like to travel? Etc.)</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">What brought you to this company?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">What are you working on now? What are some of your favorite past projects? What are you looking forward to working on?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">What are your top goals for this year?</li>
</ul>
<p class="Headings_Heading-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor049"></a>
 Aligning on expectations:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">How would you like to see us work together? What are your expectations for me?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Are there things you&apos;ve liked, or not liked, about working with people in my role before? Do you have any pet peeves?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">How often would you like to meet?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">How do you like to give and receive feedback?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Is there anything you&apos;d like to change about my 30/60/90 day plan?</li>
</ul>
<p class="Headings_Heading-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor050"></a>
 Opportunities:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">How are you feeling about the team and how things have been going?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Is there anything you&apos;re hoping to change about how the team works?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Do you have any ideas for where I could find quick wins to help the team?</li>
</ul>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor051"></a>
 Everyone else</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">For everyone else, you&apos;ll want to focus on relationship-building and getting to know what&apos;s important to them.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor052"></a>
 General questions:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Tell me about yourself.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">What are you working on? What are some of your favorite past projects? What are you looking forward to working on?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">What are your top goals for this year?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">How would you like to see us work together? Are there things you&apos;ve liked, or not liked, about working with people in my role before?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Is there anything I can do that would help you now?</li>
</ul>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor053"></a>
 Dos</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor054"></a>
 Take advantage of your beginner&apos;s eyes</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As Bryan Jowers, a VP of product, says:</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">You only get to go through product purchase and onboarding once as a first time user. Be sure to document your emotions, what you understand, and don&apos;t understand.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Your notes could be useful in improving the product or even improving the onboarding process for the next hire.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor055"></a>
 Become the expert on your product and users</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Get as much exposure to users and customers as possible. Meet with them in-person or on video calls. If your company has them, join sales calls and user research sessions. Answer support tickets. See what people are talking about on social media. Conduct your own interviews to understand why people are choosing your product and what challenges they&apos;re having with it. A huge part of your early credibility will come from your direct knowledge of the customer.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Another key area to become an expert in is your own product and technology. You&apos;ll want to make sure you understand not only your own feature area but also the broader product and how the various parts interact. If you don&apos;t deeply understand the product, you won&apos;t be able to spot opportunities, pitfalls, or important constraints.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor056"></a>
 Build credibility</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It takes time for your teammates to begin to trust you and your judgment. One way to make it go faster is to share your thought processes and frameworks. Explain where your intuitions come from.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor057"></a>
 Get quick wins in early</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Being helpful will help you to get off on the right foot. Often, you can take some grunt work off your teammates&apos; hands, or you can help them complete something important that they&apos;ve been putting off or struggling with.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As someone new to the team, you probably have extra time to spend on tedious tasks. You might find that a task they didn&apos;t want to do is a great learning experience for you. You can also ask your onboarding buddy for tasks you can pick up. This could be a bug they&apos;re handling, a small feature, or anything that will let you contribute to the team and get used to the processes in a scoped-down setting.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor058"></a>
 Look for ways to feel like you belong at the company</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Join employee resource groups, social groups, sports teams, etc. Invite your coworkers out for coffee or lunch. The more you feel like you have friends at the company and feel like you belong, the happier you will be in the role in the long run.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor059"></a>
 Make it easy for people to give you feedback</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">New people aren&apos;t expected to get it perfect the first time. By explicitly checking in for feedback, you can make it easier for people to tell you what you&apos;re doing wrong and share their ideas of what &quot;excellent&quot; would look like, without it reflecting poorly on you.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You can ask, &quot;Here&apos;s what I&apos;m planning to change; does that sound good, or am I missing anything?&quot; You can check in with your buddy or partners after a meeting and ask if they have any feedback, or what they feel amazing work would look like. You can hold a retrospective meeting after your first week to talk about what you want to change or continue as a team.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor060"></a>
 Don&apos;ts</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor061"></a>
 Don&apos;t start by telling people they&apos;re doing it all wrong</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">That&apos;s a quick way to alienate people. Instead, ask why they chose to do things that way, and be genuinely curious about their answer. Feel free to follow up with, &quot;Did you consider doing it this other way?&quot;</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor062"></a>
 Don&apos;t shut people down—Say &quot;yes, and…&quot;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When you&apos;re new, you can get inundated with people asking for things or sharing their ideas for what you should do. A lot of those ideas won&apos;t be very good, or won&apos;t be high-priority. Instead of saying, &quot;No, that&apos;s a bad solution,&quot; you can say, &quot;Yes, I agree that&apos;s a problem worth solving.&quot; Even if your next sentence tells them it&apos;s not high on your list, they&apos;ll feel heard and be more willing to work with you in the future.</p>

 Don&apos;t try to make major changes right away</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It&apos;s important to first listen and learn context before changing things. Then, when you&apos;re ready to make a change, be intentional about how you roll it out to bring the rest of your teammates along. Early on, try planting seeds of an idea rather than presenting a huge case.</p>

 Don&apos;t assume you need to maintain all previous decisions</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">New PMs often inherit a project in the middle of the product life cycle. Chances are, you&apos;ll disagree with some of the decisions the previous PM made, and you&apos;ll need to live with the product you ship. This situation calls for delicacy: talk to your manager and teammates to get a sense for how fixed the earlier decisions are. Sometimes you&apos;ll learn that the team is more than happy to change course, and other times you&apos;ll find out that they just want you to help them get the work out the door.</p>

 : The best use of your first 90 days is to learn as much as you can about the team, company, product, and customers. Take advantage of the extra time on your schedule to get a head start on the information that will help you succeed. Until you&apos;re ramped up on that, it will be hard for coworkers to trust your suggestions.</li>

<span class="CharOverride-1">Be clear about expectations</span>
 : Each PM job is a little different, and misunderstandings are common in the first 90 days. Find out how people would like to work with you so you don&apos;t accidentally step on their toes or fail to pick up a responsibility they expected you to handle. Make sure you&apos;re clear with your manager about your top priorities and when deliverables are due. Put your plan in writing and share it so that everyone is on the same page.</li>
