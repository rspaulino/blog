<p class="First-Paragraph---Main-Book">
<span class="AllCaps-Bold _idGenCharOverride-1">One year, my</span>
 manager at Asana came to me with this challenge: &quot;I want you to turn the PM team into a well-oiled machine.&quot; Our team had been doing well, but we were a little fly-by-the-seat-of-our-pants.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">We only had a handful of PMs on the team, and we&apos;d been letting each person do their job the way they liked. This mostly worked fine, except when two PMs happened to be working on the same part of the product. For example, there was the time when one PM introduced a big new premium feature at the same time as another PM redesigned the UI to remove the entry point to that feature… oops! It was time for me to move beyond thinking of my team as just a collection of people, and to think about it as an organization.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As you move into upper management, you&apos;ll gain the responsibility to design the structures and processes to help your organization run smoothly. It turns out that lots of PMs all running as fast as they can in whatever direction they want doesn&apos;t actually lead to the highest velocity and best results overall.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor824" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Responsibilities</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor825"></a>
 Build your team culture <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As the leader of a team, you must be intentional about creating the culture you want.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">What values and accomplishments will you emphasize? How do you want people to interact? How will you show recognition? What kind of <a id="_idIndexMarker618"></a>
 training will you provide? How will you encourage team bonding?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Most companies have some budget set aside for culture-building activities. You might be able to host special training events, take the team to a conference, go out for fun events, or buy gifts for your team.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Leadership training is a great investment for team culture. You get dedicated team bonding time and learn new shared skills. At Asana, every employee went through Conscious Leadership training, and it created a shared language for collaboration.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-001-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00044.html#endnote-001">1</a>
</span>
</span>
 <span class="EndNote CharOverride-1"><a id="_idIndexMarker619"></a>
</span>
 Enneagram workshops (see <a href="text00031.html#_idTextAnchor554">&quot;The Enneagram&quot; in Chapter 20</a>
 ) are another great way to learn about each other and how to work better together. Ask around to learn which workshops are well respected.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Another important part of <a id="_idIndexMarker620"></a>
 culture is how you show recognition and appreciate each other. You could create awards that you give out monthly for demonstrating team values, or you could invite PMs who have done exceptionally well to share their stories at a team meeting. Consider a mix of public and private forms of recognition.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor826"></a>
 Get your team the resources and support they need <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As a manager, one part of helping your team to run smoothly is making sure everyone on your team has what they need. Do they need money for test devices, a dedicated data scientist, or more support from user researchers? Are they distracted by tension with the sales team? Are they getting everything they need from partner teams?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It&apos;s up to you to notice opportunities like these. The PMs on your team might assume that things have to stay the way they&apos;ve always been, but you should take the time to imagine what ideal relationships and resourcing would look like. Don&apos;t wait for someone above you to initiate the change; be proactive and use your relationships with other managers to get your teams working better together.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor827"></a>
 Establish product processes <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Most teams follow a product life cycle that&apos;s roughly similar to Discover, Define, Design, Develop, Deliver, <a id="_idIndexMarker621"></a>
 Debrief as described in <a href="text00005.html#_idTextAnchor025">&quot;The Product Life Cycle&quot; in Chapter 2</a>
 . Each of these stages is an opportunity to add training, templates, guidelines, or reviews.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">For each process, consider the tradeoffs between product quality, team <a id="_idIndexMarker622"></a>
 autonomy, and the velocity of iteration. Heavier processes can improve pre-launch quality to an extent, but they also discourage post-launch iteration and improvement. Small teams who work closely together may only need one or two &quot;required&quot; reviews, while larger teams with more cross-functional work or less experienced PMs may need more.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here are some processes to consider.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor828"></a>
 User research debrief</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The debrief is not usually a formal review, but it&apos;s a great time for product leaders to learn about the problems the team discovered, ask additional questions, and give early feedback on which direction to pursue. This review is a way for the feature team to bring leaders along in the discovery process, so they&apos;ll be more likely to support the team&apos;s decisions.</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">
<span class="CharOverride-2">When:</span>
 At the end of the Discovery stage, or after any significant new user research.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Who leads:</span>
 User researcher.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Who participates:</span>
 Product leadership (Head of Product, Head of Design, Head of Research, Head of Product Engineering), Feature team.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor829"></a>
 Spec review</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Spec review, or another kind of pre-design review, is a great way to align on the plan while it&apos;s still early enough to make changes. At this stage, product leaders get a chance to learn about the discovery work the team has done and what direction they&apos;re proposing. Spec review can also be a team activity where PMs review each other&apos;s specs and give each other feedback.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Intentionally set expectations for how feedback is given:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Do you want people to focus on supportive as well as constructive feedback?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Should they give a lot of feedback or only the feedback that would affect their team?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Are you looking for feedback on the formatting of the spec, or just the content?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Do you encourage people to debate their points, or share and let it go?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Should the feedback be provided as comments on the document, or shared in a meeting?</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You&apos;ll also want to make it clear when the PM can move forward from spec review. Do they need to get approval, or are they free to choose to move on after they&apos;ve heard feedback? Does the manager let them know if they need to iterate?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Specs are an excellent place to add templates. You&apos;ll want to keep the template short so that people don&apos;t get used to ignoring sections, but when used sparingly, the sections can be a great prompt to think about areas that are often overlooked such as <a id="_idIndexMarker623"></a>
 internationalization.</p>

<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor830"></a>
 <a id="_idIndexMarker624"></a>
 <a id="_idIndexMarker625"></a>
 Design review</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Design review is a tricky process because in modern software companies, the design is rarely locked down at a clear point in time. You&apos;ll need PMs and designers to work closely together to decide what work to show, at what time, and in what <a id="_idIndexMarker626"></a>
 fidelity. Often, it makes sense to have a weekly &quot;Design Crit&quot; (Design Critique) where designers show each other their work and give non-binding feedback.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Make sure teams are clear about where in the design process they are and what kind of feedback they want. Early on, they should show conceptual ideas such as flow diagrams or options of a few directions the solution could go. In the middle, they should show low fidelity mockups or wireframes to discuss interaction design. At the end, they should show high <a id="_idIndexMarker627"></a>
 fidelity designs with near-final visuals.</p>

<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor831"></a>
 Eng design doc review</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Engineers usually run this process, but if it doesn&apos;t exist, you might want to nudge your engineering counterpart to implement it. This review is the equivalent to a spec review for PMs; the engineers share how they plan to approach the problem from a technical perspective, and other engineers at the company can point out possible alternatives, things to be careful of, or issues they missed.</p>
<ul>

 Experiment results review</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If your team runs <a id="_idIndexMarker628"></a>
 A/B tests, you&apos;ll want to get together as a group with data scientists and engineers to analyze the results. It often takes a lot of experience before you start noticing patterns in the results, so it helps to have a regular group of people who look at all results.</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">
<span class="CharOverride-2">When:</span>
 After A/B tests have run long enough to reach statistical significance.</li>

</ul>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor833"></a>
 Launch review</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you have a team of independent senior PMs, launch review might be the only required review you need. It gives you a chance to ensure quality and catch major problems before they go out.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The more you can document about your launch review, the more PMs will anticipate your responses and catch problems on their own.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here are some things to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">What should the team prepare for the launch review? Will you try the product out yourself? Should they prepare the first-time state?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">What standard questions will you ask?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Under what circumstances do you veto a launch? What kind of changes do you request? What imperfections are you willing to overlook?</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In an ideal world, launch review can be more than a quality control checkpoint; it can be a coaching experience where teams absorb company values and product philosophies.</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">
<span class="CharOverride-2">When:</span>

<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor834"></a>
 Build out a <a id="_idIndexMarker629"></a>
 product planning process <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Surrounding the product process for each individual launch is a larger planning process that determines which problems and goals to go after. The planning process guides decisions across multiple teams and projects, including which new teams will be started and what each team&apos;s goals will be.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Planning processes are usually run on an annual or quarterly basis. Tying planning to the calendar, rather than a stage in the product life cycle, ensures that you regularly step back and assess whether or not you&apos;re on the right path. It&apos;s easy to get caught up in the day-to-day work and miss the bigger picture, such as when it&apos;s time to switch priorities or pivot.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Planning works best when it combines top-down and bottom-up processes. Individual contributors across the company will have the widest range of creative ideas and are on the front lines of new trends. Company and product leaders have the broadest context, and hopefully, the strongest strategic thinking to synthesize the ideas and tradeoffs.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As important as the bottom-up part of planning is, it usually requires explicit structures in order to be effective. People outside of the leadership team don&apos;t automatically know the right time to share ideas, what kind of ideas to share, or how to effectively make a case. They might also have trouble carving out time from their regular responsibilities to do longer-term thinking.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here are some approaches:</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor835"></a>
 Publish the planning timeline to the whole company</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Many people would like to be involved in planning the future of the product, but they just don&apos;t know when they should share their ideas.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Try publishing a timeline of when to submit proposals, when discussions happen, and when each stage of approval and communication happens. This gives people a chance to contribute before the decisions are finalized.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor836"></a>
 Consider the &quot;<a id="_idIndexMarker630"></a>
 W framework&quot; for planning</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The W framework helps information flow between leaders and teams.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-002-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00044.html#endnote-002">2</a>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It consists of 4 steps:</p>
<ol>
<li class="Numbers-Left" value="1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Context</span>
 : Leadership shares a high-level strategy with teams.</li>
<li class="Numbers-Left" value="2">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Plans</span>
 : Teams respond with proposed plans.</li>
<li class="Numbers-Left" value="3">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Integration</span>
 : Leadership integrates into a single plan, and shares with teams.</li>
<li class="Numbers-Left" value="4"><a id="_idIndexMarker631"></a>
 <span class="CharOverride-2">Buy-in</span>
 : Teams make final tweaks, confirm buy-in, and get rolling.</li>
</ol>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This back-and-forth ensures that the plan will work for everyone involved.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor837"></a>
 Make an open call for requests</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">People across the company might have great ideas and insights based on their unique perspectives. You can share a template or form to ensure people submit their ideas in the most helpful way.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor838"></a>
 Host <a id="_idIndexMarker632"></a>
 strategy days with your team</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">To <a id="_idIndexMarker633"></a>
 allocate time specifically for strategic planning, you can hold an offsite strategic planning event with activities to solicit ideas from everyone on your team.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">By including junior team members in the planning process, you generate more ideas and expose people to strategic work that will help them grow.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor839" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Growth Practices</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor840"></a>
 Use <a id="_idIndexMarker634"></a>
 deadlines effectively <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Deadlines are controversial. Those in favor of them say they help teams move faster, make necessary tradeoffs, and make it possible to coordinate big events. Those who are against them believe that they demotivate people, reduce quality, and cause people to push problems into the future, slowing teams down overall.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It&apos;s important to make intentional decisions around deadlines as part of the planning process so you can avoid miscommunication and misalignment. You don&apos;t want the sales team believing a date was a firm commitment when the product team thought it was just a rough estimate.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here are some examples of the range of possible approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Have a few &quot;set in stone&quot; dates. For example, hosting a big conference each year.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Let each team set their own dates in concert with leadership, and ensure they&apos;re aware that there are consequences if the dates are missed. For example, receiving a poor performance review.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Let each team set their own dates, and have the teams hold a retrospective if they miss them.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Don&apos;t set any dates. Teams can estimate when things will be done, but those estimates are not considered commitments.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The best approach to use will vary based on the type of work, company needs, and individual people. The more pressure you put on dates, the more unwanted side effects may happen, such as cutting quality to ship on time, adding excessive buffers that results in slower work, or burnout. On the other hand, dates can bring very useful clarity and constraints to prioritization decisions.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Without dates, teams can get distracted by all kinds of other work that comes in. People might work on side projects or unnecessary features, since the trade-off is less visible. When there&apos;s a set deadline, they&apos;ll need to think twice about taking on extra work that could cause them to miss it. Deadlines make it easier for the PM to say no to extra work since everyone can see that there&apos;s a limited amount of work that can fit in.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As a leader, you&apos;ll need to pay close attention to your teams and see what approach works best for them.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor841"></a>
 <a id="_idIndexMarker635"></a>
 Allocate people efficiently <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Allocation is like solving a Rubik&apos;s Cube. Each move has an impact on the rest—shift this piece over here, and the others are popped out of place. Instead, you need to look at each move in the context of the broader puzzle.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Likewise, in team allocation, there are tricky tradeoffs and constraints. You need to find the best way to match your PMs to the work and the other teammates, all while balancing across what&apos;s best for each team and individual.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You could choose to stack the highest priority work with all of the best people, or you might choose to distribute the talent more evenly. You&apos;ll need to assess how much the allocation will <a id="_idIndexMarker636"></a>
 stretch each person, and whether there are gaps where you need to add more support. You&apos;ll need to think about whether people are accessing opportunities that will keep them engaged and help them grow. On top of all that, you&apos;ll want to consider personalities in order to reduce predictable interpersonal conflicts.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When you do allocation, it&apos;s worth it to consider all of your people, even if there&apos;s a very obvious solution that only moves one person. If you always move the person whose project is just finishing up, you miss the opportunity to make more strategic allocation choices.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Consider these factors when determining who should work on each team or project:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">How much of a <a id="_idIndexMarker637"></a>
 stretch will the work be?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">How senior is the rest of the team? Is there someone who can step up as a leader?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Is the team under-resourced in any area (e.g., design, data science, user research), and how does that match up with the PM&apos;s skill set?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">How critical is the work?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Does the work and team structure support good mentorship?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">How much do they want to be on the team, and have they been getting the projects they want in the past?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">How does this fit into their growth plan?</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Allocation is all about tradeoffs—what&apos;s best for the business and what&apos;s best for individual people&apos;s growth? What&apos;s best in the short and the long run? What&apos;s best for one team versus another?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You might sometimes get lucky and everyone will end up on their first-choice team, but that won&apos;t always happen. It will be up to you to explain why you&apos;re allocating people the way you are and to get them excited about their team. Connect the work to the skills they&apos;ll build and their career goals.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor842" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Concepts and Frameworks</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor843"></a>
 <a id="_idIndexMarker638"></a>
 Horizontal tasks</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">An incredibly valuable part of Google&apos;s <a id="_idIndexMarker639"></a>
 APM program is what they call &quot;horizontal tasks.&quot; Executives at the company come up with a list of business questions, projects, and responsibilities. APMs can then volunteer to take on any of those &quot;horizontal tasks.&quot; The tasks themselves are often time consuming and tedious, but they come along with exposure to executives, higher level meetings, and strategy that the APM would otherwise not get until they were much more senior.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here are some examples of good horizontal tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Taking notes at an executive meeting.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Doing the administrative work to run an upper-level staff meeting.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Putting slides together for board meetings.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Gathering weekly product metrics.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Horizontal tasks can be a great win-win. Executives benefit from the extra assistance, and the PMs benefit from the exposure. Consider adding horizontal tasks at your company!</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor844"></a>
 <a id="_idIndexMarker640"></a>
 Org design</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As your organization grows, you&apos;ll need to think about how to split up the work. When the company is small, you might have a scattered set of distinct teams. But as the company grows, you&apos;ll likely need a more complex hierarchy, grouping the teams into divisions.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here are some signs you need to invest in longer-term org design:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">People spend a large percentage of their time ramping up on new areas as they jump from project to project.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Teams make short-sighted product decisions.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Teams are reluctant to make long-term investments.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">The team has grown large enough that you need to delegate management.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There are many ways to organize long-running teams. Often, companies will use multiple options at the same time. For example, they might organize by product at a higher level, and then within products by user type. Or, they might organize by objective, but also organize a few teams by the engineering codebase. It&apos;s fairly common for companies to reorganize every one to three years.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">To help illustrate the options, consider a hypothetical social media company DogTok where dog owners share videos of their dogs. We&apos;ll explore what that might look like, and how they might add a new feature, &quot;Bark Translation,&quot; that captions the videos with what the dogs are saying.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here are some common approaches for organizing teams:</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor845"></a>
 By product</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">What it is</span>
 : This is when there is a team or organization for each separate product at the company. There may also be a shared services team to own and invest in components that are used by multiple products.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Example</span>
 : DogTok might decide that Bark Translation deserves to be its own app. They would spin up a new division with its own general manager and teams of people who work on various features of the app.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Benefits</span>
 : Dividing by products offers clear boundaries, and each product can usually run autonomously.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Drawbacks</span>
 : It can be hard to drive consistency across products.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Who it works for</span>
 : Large companies that need multiple levels of organization hierarchy. Independent products that don&apos;t require much cross-product collaboration.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">How to make It work:</span>
 Unless the products are very small, you&apos;ll usually need to use another organization style within each product.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor846"></a>
 By short-term project</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">What it is</span>
 : In small organizations, you can assign individual short-term projects such as &quot;Twitter importer&quot; or &quot;Calendar view.&quot;</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Example</span>
 : If DogTok organizes by short-term project, the leadership team decides what to work on next. They assign each piece of work to a small, temporary team based on availability, interest, and skills. One team builds the <a id="_idIndexMarker641"></a>
 onboarding experience in January, and a different set of people run A/B tests on it in August. The leadership team spins up a &quot;Bark Translation&quot; team who builds the entire feature and integrates it into the existing video player. After it ships, they move on to start building another feature.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Benefits</span>
 : Leadership gets to clearly dictate what gets worked on. At a small, early-stage startup, the founders probably have a clear vision of what they want to build, and it might be unnecessary to delegate those choices.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Drawbacks</span>
 : The single-project approach can discourage long-term thinking on both the product and engineering side, leading to accumulating engineering debt and a lack of product expertise. It also increases the percentage of time people spend in a lower-productivity &quot;ramping up&quot; state, both in terms of the project itself, as well as learning to work with new teammates.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Who it works for</span>
 : This places most of the strategic thinking on leadership and is usually more appropriate for teams led by junior PMs.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">How to make it work</span>
 : If you choose to organize teams by project, you should put extra effort into communicating what you expect to the teams. Make sure they understand the strategic reasons the project was chosen, and what you&apos;re hoping to get out of it. Be clear about how strictly they should stick to the initial project idea; should they do their own research, can they consider alternate solutions, what kind of early validation do you expect?</li>
</ul>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor847"></a>
 By engineering codebase</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">What it is</span>
 : Historically, many teams were organized around the engineering codebase. Each team owned a part of the product that corresponded to specific files and folders in the code repository.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Example</span>
 : If DogTok organizes by engineering codebase, they create a team for each component and piece of infrastructure. Each file in the codebase belongs to one team. They have a team for the ranking algorithm, one for the search box, one for the comment box, and so on. Someone at the company who had the idea for Bark Translation would try to convince the video team to add it to their roadmap.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Benefits</span>
 : Engineers can build up expertise in their area and you get clear responsibility over bugs, design decisions, code quality, and long-term maintenance of the code base. It avoids two PMs stepping on each other&apos;s toes or making conflicting changes, since each component has a clear owner.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Drawbacks</span>
 : The codebase usually doesn&apos;t map to specific customers, <a id="_idIndexMarker642"></a>
 <a id="_idIndexMarker643"></a>
 use cases, or problems, and so it&apos;s hard to launch impactful changes. It can be challenging to find the highest priority work for your team; it&apos;s not straightforward to find the most important customer need that can be solved with your part of the codebase. It&apos;s possible that the highest priority work on one part of the codebase is quite low priority for the company overall. Even worse, many important customer problems can&apos;t be solved in just one part of the codebase, and this organization adds a lot of friction to solving those problems.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Who it works for</span>
 : When you have parts of the codebase that require deep technical expertise, this might be the best organization for those teams. It makes sense at most companies to have <span class="CharOverride-3">some</span>
 teams that are split by codebase, but to use this option sparingly. If you don&apos;t have enough specialized mobile engineers to embed in each team, you can create a centralized mobile team. Infrastructure teams are often organized around the systems they maintain.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">How to make it work</span>
 : This organizational approach requires strategic leadership at a higher level in order to ensure the teams are appropriately staffed to match company priorities and help guide them towards high-impact strategic work.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor848"></a>
 By user type</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">What it is</span>
 : If your product has distinct types of users with different needs, such as administrators and knowledge workers, or drivers and riders, you can create teams that are each responsible for improving the product for their user type.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Example</span>
 : If DogTok organizes by user type, they create one team for dog owners, one team for viewers, and one for advertisers. The PMs for each of those teams spends a lot of time with their audience, getting to know their needs and how to increase their usage of the product, and then creating a roadmap for the team. The Bark Translation feature arose out of conversations with dog owners, and so they take on the work.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Benefits</span>
 : When PMs own a specific user type, they can become experts in those users and assess which problems are the highest impact to solve for that user. They can design holistic solutions across multiple parts of the product.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Drawbacks</span>
 : A downside of organizing by user type is that multiple PMs might have conflicting ideas regarding in which direction to take different parts of the product, for example, what functionality to highlight on the homepage.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Who it works for</span>
 : This organization works well when you have distinct customer types who need to be served over the long run. Many companies have a product team focused on IT administrators.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">How to make it work</span>
 : You&apos;ll need an approach to moderate conflicting ideas, for example, assigning ownership of contentious areas to teams, or carefully reviewing and moderating the proposed changes.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor849"></a>
 By <a id="_idIndexMarker644"></a>
 use case (or problem)</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">What it is</span>
 : When a product has multiple prominent use cases, such as creating content and consuming it, you can create teams that are each responsible for improving their use case. Often, each use case is closely tied to a few parts of the product, for example, the team responsible for content discovery probably owns the search UI. Framing the team&apos;s charter around the use case instead of the product area encourages the team to look for the best solution wherever in the product it might go. This can lead to better and more impactful solutions.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Example</span>
 : If DogTok organizes by use case, they create teams for video creation, exploration, onboarding, and monetization. The video creation team noticed that as they add unique video editing capabilities, people upload more videos. This gave rise to the idea of Bark Translation, which they then built.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Benefits</span>
 : Organizing by use case shares many of the benefits of organizing by user type, while also giving leadership more fine-grained control over what types of problems teams choose to solve. PMs can become experts in their use cases, and are encouraged to find the highest impact problems to solve within their predefined scope.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Drawbacks</span>
 : Teams organized around specific use cases might need to be spun up or spun down frequently, as company priorities change. For example, after a year of investing in content discovery or exporting data, the company might decide that those use cases are handled well enough and people should be reallocated to more pressing problems. Relatedly, tackling a newly identified problem often involves spinning up a new team, which can be more overhead than you want.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Who it works for</span>
 : Organizing by use case works well in smaller organizations where leaders creating the teams are deeply knowledgeable about the priorities of individual problems and use cases.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">How to make it work</span>
 : Look for use cases that are <a id="_idIndexMarker645"></a>
 MECE (mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive) to avoid gaps or PMs stepping on each other&apos;s toes. You may also want to have a &quot;special ops&quot; team that tackles high priority short-term projects that don&apos;t fit into an existing use case.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor850"></a>
 By <a id="_idIndexMarker646"></a>
 objective</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">What it is</span>
 : When your organization is going after a few distinct goals and you have senior product leaders, you can organize teams around objectives such as adoption, monetization, or new user growth. In this model, the team owns a key success metric and can consider a very broad range of ideas to move that metric. For example, at Facebook, the growth team tackled international expansion and even bringing internet connectivity to more parts of the world, in addition to more traditional growth projects like revamping the <a id="_idIndexMarker647"></a>
 onboarding experience.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Example</span>
 : If DogTok organizes by objective, they create teams for increasing uploads from existing dog owners, increasing video views, improving adoption of new viewers, and improving monetization. The team responsible for increasing uploads discovers that people like to upload to explore the fun overlays, and decides to build Bark Translation.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Benefits</span>
 : Teams have a clear mission and are very empowered to solve it in the way they think is best. Leadership is crystal clear about what results they want, while pushing the &quot;how&quot; down to the PMs who are closer to the problems. This model also encourages good strategic practices in the leadership team; they&apos;ll need to think about what objectives matter, and their relative priorities.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Drawbacks</span>
 : This model might falsely empower teams if they&apos;re not actually allowed to choose their own approach. Or, it can lead to stress and wasted efforts if the teams aren&apos;t strong enough to choose good projects.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Who it works for</span>
 : This model works best when you have strong senior PMs and high-level <a id="_idIndexMarker648"></a>
 objectives of roughly equal priorities. For example, if you have four high-level priorities of equal importance, you can create four teams. However, if one of those priorities is much more important than the others, you might want three teams working on that priority, and you&apos;ll need a different way to differentiate what each of those teams work on.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">How to make it work</span>
 : Set clear expectations with PMs around how much autonomy they have and when to bring plans to you for review. They may need extensive coaching on how to set a good roadmap and what types of risks are &quot;good&quot; risks to take.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor851" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Key Takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Structure helps you scale</span>
 : When done well, each PM gets the freedom they need to own an important area and move fast towards ambitious goals. They also get the necessary guardrails to keep teams strategically aligned and prevent excessive conflict or wasted work. Beware of team structures that make it hard to ship end-to-end solutions.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">The organization is your product</span>
 : As a product leader, the quality of your organization is your direct deliverable. Invest in your team <a id="_idIndexMarker649"></a>
 culture. Develop the people on your team. Look for systemic opportunities to improve how your team creates products.</li>
