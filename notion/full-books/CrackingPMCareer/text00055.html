 How did you get into product management?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I studied computer science and decided to move to Oregon when I graduated in 2002. I connected with an entrepreneur through Craigslist and joined his new company, JanRain, as the second engineer. At the time, I was looking for interesting work and to learn how to build and ship real software that people wanted to use.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I worked at JanRain for eight years experimenting and shipping a lot of different things. Ultimately, the company found some success building a platform product for internet identity and cultivating the OpenID protocol.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">During my time at JanRain, I would meet with our partners like Google, Yahoo, and Facebook and learn about their needs and their vision for the future. While I was doing that, I got exposed to the incredible products they were building, which inspired me to make a move into a more consumer-facing product role.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In 2010, I moved to San Francisco and joined Twitter&apos;s platform team as a product manager. Our goal was to enable app developers, websites and publishers to do more with less. We built APIs, widgets, and platform products that made it easy to do things like share back into Twitter, follow accounts, and build content around tweets. Our work helped bring the best of Twitter to a wider audience off-network, which was super fun and exciting. Later on, I worked on the home timeline team.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">After four years, I was ready to do something different. I&apos;d loved working with Ev Williams at the beginning of my time at Twitter and really liked the <a id="_idIndexMarker881"></a>
 mission he had at Medium around elevating good ideas and discourse on the internet. I met the team and they were really thoughtful—they were people I wanted to be around and learn from. I joined Medium as the second PM and got to collaborate across the organization on every part of the platform.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1072" style=";color:black;"></a>
 What inspired you to focus on climate change?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">At that point, after having two kids, my wife and I decided to move back to Portland, Oregon. I joined a startup as the head of product. One day, I was stuck in traffic, and listening to the audiobook of Whole Earth Discipline, by Steward Brand. There was a section about what would need to happen by 2050 to prevent the worst effects of climate change, and it was absolutely extreme. I sat up and thought, &quot;Why isn&apos;t everyone freaking out about this and doing everything within their power to take action? I need to go work on that right now.&quot; Something clicked, and I decided I needed to start learning more about it.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I read a lot of books, and one of them was <span class="CharOverride-1">Drawdown</span>
 , by Paul Hawken.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">For someone who is new to thinking about climate change, it quantifies a hundred different solutions based on their impact. It provides a framework for thinking about what problem to go work on. And the impact isn&apos;t always obvious.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">People tend to think about electric cars, but there are fifteen or twenty things that would have a way larger impact—things like refrigeration technology. And so, I created a giant Airtable spreadsheet of sectors and companies and tried to come up with my own impact score for each company.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As a lifelong bicycle commuter and active transit advocate, the company I chose, Ride Report, ended up being a unique fit because we are building a platform that helps city officials implement sustainable policies for transportation. We currently focus on shared bikes and scooters, and in the future will add in more connected vehicles to cover e-commerce deliveries, ride hailing, and things like that. Cities can try out new policies, like creating a protected bike lane or adding more electric vehicles to the right-of-way and learn what impact that has on congestion, safety, equitable access, and climate pollution.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Our company’s <a id="_idIndexMarker882"></a>
 mission is to accelerate the transition to a sustainable efficient transportation system, which is really exciting for me because it’s directly related to my personal mission to improve climate outcomes for future generations. That connection enables me to work with confidence knowing my energy is being directed towards a problem that I care about and know will have an impact.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1073" style=";color:black;"></a>
 What advice would you have for PMs who want to succeed in their careers?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">My top piece of advice is to figure out what your mission is and to find companies that are aligned with that mission.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">If you can find a role with a mission that you deeply believe in, you&apos;re going to be so much more satisfied. Your work will be more fun, you&apos;ll enjoy it more, and you&apos;ll learn a lot more.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I encourage people to spend a lot of time thinking about that and searching for it.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Especially as a senior leader, it&apos;s really important to be super mission aligned. It not only energizes your own work, but also the work of everyone around you.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">If you feel strongly about a particular <a id="_idIndexMarker883"></a>
 mission or about an outcome that you feel needs to exist, I want to encourage you to chase that down. There are opportunities around almost any outcome that you can think of out there.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I&apos;d always been concerned about the environment and climate, but it hadn&apos;t occurred to me that I could take my product skills and apply them to the space. I wish I&apos;d known earlier that I could take my personal passion and explore it as a professional opportunity.</p>
