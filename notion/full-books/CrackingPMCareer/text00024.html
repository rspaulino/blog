<p class="First-Paragraph---Main-Book">
<span class="AllCaps-Bold _idGenCharOverride-1">When Lenny Rachitsky</span>
 joined Airbnb, almost 50% of the guests who tried to book an Airbnb failed. They&apos;d found a place where they wanted to stay, but too often they were either rejected or ignored by the host. It was clear this was a problem.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">For a year, he and his team tried to attack the problem incrementally. They tried to convince hosts to accept more bookings with reminders and incentives. They tried experiments such as warning the host if they weren&apos;t responding quickly enough. Plenty of the experiments were successful, but overall, the team did not see significant improvements on the 50% failure rate.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Rachitsky describes what happened next:</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">There was a point at which we kind of flipped the script and wondered, &quot;What if we were to work backwards from the ideal Airbnb? What would we do if we started Airbnb today?&quot;</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">We realized the ideal experience is you find a home, you book it, and you&apos;re done. You have a home as soon as you find it.</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">The Instant Book feature actually existed from early on. Some hosts didn&apos;t care about approving the guests; they just wanted to accept. But only 5% of hosts were using Instant at that point.</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">So, the bet we made was to just go big on Instant Book and try to morph the entire marketplace from what it was (less than 5% Instant Book) to all Instant Book. We set this really ambitious goal of 100% Instant Book. We&apos;re going to move everyone to instant booking; we realized that&apos;s the future of Airbnb.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">That ambitious vision was incredibly successful. It helped the team realize they were going down the wrong path when trying to incrementally increase acceptance rate. The 100% target helped the team deprioritize all work that would become obsolete once hosts moved to Instant Book.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Getting to 100% Instant Book is a great target, but on its own, it&apos;s an abstract wish. Rachitsky also made the vision tangible: &quot;I made an image of a guy walking through a minefield, where the mines are all the little things that go wrong when a host gets an Instant Booking they don&apos;t expect (and thus don&apos;t use Instant Book). For example, guests booking on short notice, or planning to have a party, or bring their dog. Our strategy and roadmap was to defuse each of those mines. That really stuck in people&apos;s minds.&quot;</p>

 Brainstorm an ambitious <a id="_idIndexMarker367"></a>
 vision <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Get your team together and ask &quot;If we could wave a magic wand, what would the ideal experience be?&quot;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Great visions are often found when you step outside the box because they remove a constraint that everyone assumed was fixed. Sometimes, they&apos;ll remove a step in the customer journey, such as in Airbnb&apos;s Instant Book. Sometimes, they&apos;ll require new technical innovation, such as Apple&apos;s voicemail transcription. Sometimes, they&apos;ll require a giant investment in a new area, such Google&apos;s Street View cars. And, sometimes they’ll require a change in societal norms, such as Lyft asking you to get in a car with a stranger.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here are some questions that can help you create a more ambitious and ideal vision:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">If we were starting a new company from scratch, what would &quot;ideal&quot; look like?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">What&apos;s the slowest part, and how could we make it twice, or even ten times as fast?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">What&apos;s the most frustrating step, and how could we remove it?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">What would a delightful experience be?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">If a customer didn&apos;t understand any technical constraints, what magical thing would they ask for?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">What are some new cutting-edge technologies, inside or outside of our company? Could we use any of them to open up new possibilities?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">If our company was willing to spend any amount of money on this project, what kinds of new things would be possible?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Who is <span class="CharOverride-1">not</span>
 using our product? Why not? What would it take to win them over?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">How could we double the impact this product makes for our customers?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">What are the market trends, and where do we think the market will be in ten years?</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">How are the expectations and habits of our users changing, and does that open up new possibilities?</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Once you have a larger vision, you can work backwards to create a roadmap and then decide the first step. You could still choose to do the next obvious piece of incremental work, but you might discover a clever way to get higher impact and be closer to the vision with the same amount of effort.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor444"></a>
 Make your <a id="_idIndexMarker368"></a>
 vision concrete and inspiring <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Once you have an idea of the future you want to create, you need to put it into a format where other people will understand it and be inspired by it. You&apos;ll want to share it and see if it resonates with your team and potential customers.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As a rule, a good vision is like an infomercial.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Infomercials always start out with an emotional story about how terrible things are: jars are too difficult to open, my wardrobe is generic and dull, the blender is too annoying to clean. I might have never realized I had that problem before.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The infomercials tell me there is a better way. I can open jars on my own, adorn my t-shirts with rhinestones, and make a smoothie every morning. The spokesperson is so excited about the benefits of these amazing products that I become excited too!</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Once we&apos;re hooked on the problem and benefit, the infomercial goes into the details to convince us the product will really work. They show us a regular person using the product and how delighted they are with it. They explain the technology that makes the product possible. They go over a handful of different use cases so that you can see how your entire family will benefit.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Depending on your personality, you might be thrilled to share a vision like this, or it might feel unbearably silly. It can be helpful to watch a variety of product leaders introducing their vision, until you find a style that works for you. Some people lean into the silliness and get a bit goofy. Others stay calm and confident. The important thing is to leave people feeling sufficiently inspired.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">

 Growth Practices</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor446"></a>
 Champion new opportunities outside of your scope <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">PMs at the higher levels are expected to make an impact at the company level, not just on their own team. To have this larger impact, you need to discover and advocate for new opportunities.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Dare Obasanjo, a partner group program manager at Microsoft, was looking for ways to grow Bing ad revenue and found an opportunity in the browser strategy. He saw that the biggest driver of ad revenue was the number of searches, and the biggest driver of the number of searches was browser market share. People tend to stick with their browser&apos;s default search engine.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Having a popular browser was really important, but Microsoft&apos;s browser at the time suffered from compatibility issues and the core engine was so expensive to build that the team didn&apos;t have enough engineers to invest in the user experience. Obasanjo realized that Microsoft could solve all of those problems by using the open source Chromium browser engine.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Obasanjo started advocating for changing the browser strategy:</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">I realized I should go talk to the browser team. We started those conversations and I spent a lot of time evangelizing to leaders at the company.</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">Microsoft has a big email culture, so I would advocate in various discussions and those discussions would be forwarded to VPs and directors of engineering. When a company leader started a discussion on the topic, I&apos;d reach out and ask to meet and talk. When we met I&apos;d explain my rationale.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">That advocacy influenced some leaders to evolve their perspectives and became part of the decision-making process that eventually led to Microsoft adopting Chromium in the Edge browser.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The insights that lead to new opportunities can come from anywhere, but they often spark from an idea that&apos;s tangentially related to your day job, as Obasanjo&apos;s did. He started from his area of expertise and followed the thread to an opportunity outside of his scope. He painted a vision of how a change in strategy could solve problems and help the company achieve its goals. Then, he put in the work to champion that vision with company leaders and followed through to influence the change.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In addition to helping the company, championing new opportunities is a way to take your career growth into your own hands. When you discover a new, greenfield opportunity, often you&apos;ll be tapped as the person to lead the initiative. This can move you into leadership roles much faster than waiting to be promoted into a pre-existing initiative.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor447"></a>
 Organize company-wide vision brainstorming days <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A <span class="CharOverride-2">vision brainstorming day</span>
 is a special day, kind of like a hackathon, where people share their ideas for the future vision of your product. Unlike a hackathon, people don&apos;t need working code—they can share their vision in whatever format they like.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You can adapt the day to work for you. Here are some tips based on past experiences:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Invite people with innovative perspectives from across the organization. Often, people outside of the immediate product organization are better at seeing past constraints.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Create prize categories based on the directions you&apos;d like to encourage. You can have categories for best overall, most futuristic, biggest money-maker, customer favorite, etc.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">If you&apos;re having trouble getting people to participate, consider blocking off people&apos;s schedules for preparation, and not just demos. Or, you can make participation mandatory for a subset of people.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Have people insert their visions into a shared deck for demos, and include which person is &quot;up next&quot; on each intro template slide. This greatly reduces the transition time between each demo.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Follow up afterwards to see if you want to add any of the new ideas to the roadmap, or spin up any new teams.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Although the primary goal of a vision brainstorming day is to elicit innovative ideas and directions, it has other benefits too. It serves as a creative outlet, team-bonding event, and a strategic practice session. It can also help reinforce a culture of visionary thinking, as well as expose team members to multiple examples of what good vision can look like.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor448" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Frameworks</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor449"></a>
 Work Backwards</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Amazon popularized the framework of working backwards with their approach of starting with the press release. This approach can be extended to any size of work, from an individual feature, to a team charter, to a full product.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It might seem counterintuitive, but working backward can help you come up with much better solutions than working forward. When you work forward, you tend to be biased by what already exists, what seems easy, or what will help you hit your quarterly goals.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It&apos;s true that your idealistic vision might take years to achieve, but great companies stick around for decades. If you start taking the steps to work towards your ideal vision, you&apos;ll be in a much better place in a few years than if you go in the wrong direction quarter after quarter.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor450" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Key Takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Be ambitious and inspiring</span>
 : There&apos;s a time and a place for pragmatism, but the vision isn&apos;t that place. You can work backwards from your vision to a more pragmatic plan later. To be good at visioning, you need to push aside all the constraints and reasons why things will be hard, and figure out what the actual ideal experience would be. If you&apos;re not excited about your vision, it&apos;s not ready yet.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">A great vision is like an infomercial</span>
 : Sell the pain, then sell the solution. Include the key details and insights that convince people that the solution will really work.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Find green-field opportunities to champion</span>
 : A great way to accelerate your career growth is to identify new opportunities that no one in your company is working on, and then to create a vision for those opportunities. That vision can influence the company direction, and you might even get a chance to lead the new initiative.</li>
