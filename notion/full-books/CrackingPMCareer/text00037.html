<p class="First-Paragraph---Main-Book">
<span class="AllCaps-Bold _idGenCharOverride-1">Product managers are</span>
 often called the &quot;CEOs of product&quot;—an analogy which has various issues. However, one big truth to it is that, like being a CEO, product management is a hugely cross-functional role. As a PM, you work with everyone across the company, and your skill at working with different types of people will be a big factor in how successful you are.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">PMs who are unsuccessful working with other roles will usually find that their career stagnates. If engineers and designers don&apos;t like working with you, you&apos;ll struggle to recruit and retain team members. If execs don&apos;t like working with you, well, they will hardly want you to move up, would they? That would mean seeing <span class="CharOverride-1">more</span>
 of you—and giving you more influence.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">But this isn&apos;t just a likability contest (likability is a necessary, but not sufficient condition). Working effectively with an engineer, designer, or exec is about how you create excellent work using the best skills and insights from each of you.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">While much of how you treat a person is the same across positions—people are people, after all—we have some specific advice to offer on working with designers, engineers, and executives.</p>

 Working with <a id="_idIndexMarker515" style=";color:black;"></a>
 designers</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Product <a id="_idIndexMarker516"></a>
 designers are generally responsible for solving problems from a user experience perspective. In a healthy relationship, PMs and designers are tight <a id="_idIndexMarker517"></a>
 partners who share ideas and feedback, and ultimately <a id="_idIndexMarker518"></a>
 trust each other&apos;s judgement and are willing to accept each other&apos;s decisions.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When the relationship isn&apos;t as healthy, things can get pretty ugly. The common complaints designers have about PMs include:<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">

<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Focusing on the business value instead of the customer value.</span>
 Optimizing for metrics can be good, to a point. But, many metrics that can be measured in an experiment overlook the long-term harm of a poor user experience. Beyond that, designers tend to be more motivated by helping people than hitting numerical goals.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Treating the designer like a pixel monkey</span>
 . Designers don&apos;t like to be handed wireframes and told to &quot;make it pretty.&quot; They want to hear about the problem, not be handed a solution.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Relying on personal preference</span>
 . A good design isn&apos;t about whether you (or an executive) like the colors; it&apos;s about whether the design meets its goals and works for real users.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Not contributing enough</span>
 . Each designer has some expectation of what the PM should be providing, and unfortunately that doesn&apos;t always match the PM&apos;s expectations.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Not understanding the product deeply</span>
 . Designers rely on PMs to understand how a change in one part of the product might affect other parts. Missing this can cause big mistakes or frustrating conversations.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Not valuing good design</span>
 . The details matter in good design. Consistency matters. PMs who treat the details as optional or cut design work at the last minute to hit a launch date are showing they don&apos;t value design.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Fortunately, there are techniques to encourage a strong, positive relationship.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor674"></a>
 Have a direct conversation about working together</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Because the roles of PM and designer have so much overlap and work closely together, it&apos;s important to have a direct conversation with each designer you work with about how you&apos;d both like to collaborate. Ask what they appreciate or expect from a PM, and share what you&apos;d like or expect from a designer. The relationship can vary a lot, especially based on how experienced the designer is.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here are a few topics you might want to cover:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Do you set up daily check-ins to go over designs, or will the designer reach out proactively when they&apos;re ready for feedback? Can you see their progress on a regular cadence?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Do they like to start with a group brainstorm, or would they rather have time to think about the problem independently first?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">How would they like you to share your ideas with them? Are they okay if you draw some wireframes?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">What level of detail do they like in setting up the problem and constraints?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Will they show you different directions that they&apos;ve considered?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">When should designs use realistic customer data and when is it okay to use <span class="CharOverride-1">lorem ipsum</span>
 placeholder text?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">How early in the process will the designer consider onboarding and empty states?</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Will the designer set and share their own dates?</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This conversation might feel a little uncomfortable when you&apos;re not used to speaking so directly, but it will avoid discovering misaligned expectations later in your relationship.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor675"></a>
 Treat your designer like a <a id="_idIndexMarker519"></a>
 partner</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The PM/designer relationship works best when you treat your designer like a trusted partner instead of a resource.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As much as possible, share full context with your designer and include them in goal setting and strategy. Give them a voice when making decisions that affect the design, even if your company culture doesn&apos;t require you to do so. Ask them for feedback on your spec or for their thoughts on how to solve challenging problems. Invite them to relevant meetings, and let them present their own designs.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When disagreements happen, listen to their point of view. Try to come to solutions that work for everyone, but also be willing to defer to them in their areas of expertise.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Above all, invest in understanding each other&apos;s reasoning. Explain why you&apos;re making decisions and seek to understand their goals and frameworks.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor676"></a>
 Bring your designer problems, not solutions</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As a PM, you&apos;re responsible for defining the problem and ensuring the solution is successful. It&apos;s not your role to insist on a specific solution.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Defining the problem takes real work. Customers or internal stakeholders will often ask for specific solutions in their feature requests. The idea that comes to you in the shower is often a solution. You need to analyze the requests and ideas to determine the true pain points and goals. In addition to the customer pain points, you&apos;ll also need to set the context and requirements, such as timeframes, engineering constraints, learning goals, and different cases to design for.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Generally, it is okay to make wireframes to illustrate an idea, but it is not okay to pressure your designer into going with your solution or expect them to just &quot;pretty up&quot; your wireframes. Usually you should let the designer explore on their own before you share your own ideas.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you and your designer disagree on the right solution, make sure to frame your disagreement in terms of the problem. Give feedback in terms of goals and principles instead of solutions. Leave space for the designer to come up with another solution that will meet all the requirements.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you want to work at a company that has great designers, you need to create an environment where they want to work. Skilled designers want to explore tough problems, come up with creative solutions, and ship a polished product they can feel proud of. If you take away their autonomy, they will not want to work with you.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor677"></a>
 Speak in terms of user benefit, not business benefit</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As Julie Zhuo points out in &quot;How to Work with Designers&quot;, designers generally think about things from the perspective of the user and are motivated by how their work will help people.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-002-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00037.html#endnote-002">2</a>
</span>
</span>
 PMs usually share the same customer-centric goals, but we often use language that focuses on metrics or business success and can sound heartless or even selfish to designers.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Designers sometimes think that PMs care more about hitting short-term metric goals in order to look good to company leadership than actually creating something that helps users.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As much as possible, frame things in terms of customer benefits instead of business benefits when you&apos;re speaking with designers. For example, instead of saying &quot;we need to increase revenue&quot; you can say &quot;we need to be sure that people who want the premium version can find it.&quot;</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor678"></a>
 Set your quality bar high and don&apos;t pull a bait-and-switch</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A quick way to lose the <a id="_idIndexMarker520"></a>
 trust of your designer is to ship low-quality work. One way this happens is when the PM has agreed to the designs, but as the engineering work falls behind schedule, the PM then insists that the design needs to be cut. Or the PM states that the design work will be done in a &quot;V2&quot; that never comes.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The fair way to handle this situation is to be open about scoping concerns while designs are being made, and include the designer in decisions about changing scope. Consider cutting use cases or functionality instead of design polish. Don&apos;t say you&apos;ll do design work after launch if you can&apos;t guarantee it will actually happen.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It&apos;s common that PM and designer quality bars might be slightly different, but if they&apos;re far enough apart that it&apos;s causing repeated problems, this might be a topic for PM and design leadership to align on.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor679"></a>
 Invest appropriately in design debt and design systems improvements</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Just like engineering infrastructure sometimes hits scaling limits or falls out of date, the design system can get cluttered with new functionality or start to look dated as design trends advance.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As Laura Klein found in her survey of designers, a main area of tension between PMs and designers is how much of the product to change at once.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-003-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00037.html#endnote-003">3</a>
</span>
</span>
 PMs feel like designers often want to bundle major design changes with a small feature. Designers feel like PMs only want to add features and don&apos;t care about improving the design.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If the design improvements are small, it can make sense to combine the projects and improve the design as part of the new feature work. Some teams like to always set aside some buffer time on their projects so they can improve the design as they go.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Other times, it works better to split the work into two separate projects: one to launch the new features with the original goals, and another to improve the design, with its own success criteria. This helps the team feel like the design work is real, valuable work, rather than scope creep. If the design work is high enough priority, it can be sequenced before the new functionality.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Speak with your designers about what &quot;design debt&quot; they&apos;d like to invest in fixing while you&apos;re building the roadmap. You can think about what percentage of time is appropriate to invest, and then let the designer prioritize the work that goes into that bucket.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor680" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Working with engineers</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Engineers are responsible for creating technical solutions and maintaining them over time. In a healthy relationship, PMs and engineers are partners who work together to come up with innovative solutions that are fast, scalable, and don&apos;t slow down future development.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor681"></a>
 Treat your engineers like partners</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The most important rule for working with engineers is to treat them as respected partners. Include them throughout the product process, starting with early product discovery if possible. Share the full context with them so they can understand the purpose and reasoning behind the work. Invite them to visit customers or attend user research sessions so they can have first-hand experience with users. Ask them to share their ideas, and treat their concerns seriously.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Don&apos;t treat your engineers like &quot;code monkeys&quot; who aren&apos;t allowed to have any product opinions. Don&apos;t assume they&apos;re lazy when they push back against work. Instead, seek to understand their reasons. If the reasons are technical, make sure you understand them deeply enough to recognize what solutions could work. If the reasons are around the product choices, take the time to discuss and come to a shared understanding; you might need to share more context to help show how you came to the decisions you made.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Engineers do their best work when they understand what they&apos;re building and why.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor682"></a>
 Understand and respect technical constraints</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When engineers push back on a design for technical reasons, they usually have a good reason. If you ignore their concerns, they&apos;ll quickly lose respect for you.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You don&apos;t need to be an expert in computer science to understand technical constraints. Use your product knowledge to drive the conversation. For example, you can point out other parts of the product, or other products, that do what you wanted, and ask about what makes those different.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">For more information on working with technical constraints, look at <a href="text00013.html#_idTextAnchor205">Chapter 8: Technical Skills</a>
 .</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor683"></a>
 Never commit to dates for your engineers</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If your team needs to commit to dates, your engineers need to agree to them. Ideally, your engineers independently calculate the dates they believe they can commit to, and you add some buffer on top of that.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Choosing dates for your engineers is disrespectful; it implies that they can work as fast as you want if you just tell them to. It takes away their autonomy.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Many PMs underestimate how long engineering takes in the real world. Beyond just coding the work, engineers need to write tests, set up infrastructure, and manage the deployment schedules. Even writing the code can take longer than you&apos;d expect because they need to account for different corner cases and connect to the different parts of the system.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor684"></a>
 Respect their process</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Engineering is creative problem solving. There&apos;s not a direct relationship between hours spent at the computer and speed to completing the project.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Most of the work happens in a state of flow. Any interruptions, such as stopping by their desk to ask a question or scheduling a meeting in the middle of a big working block, can force them to context switch and take a long time to regain productivity. Avoid this whenever possible.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">On the other hand, productivity can happen in spurts. Sometimes, the engineer needs to take a walk around the block. Don&apos;t get frustrated with your engineer because it looks like they&apos;re goofing off—they might need the mental break to come back refreshed.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Relatedly, don&apos;t come storming in as a new PM and change engineering processes like sprint schedules or standups unilaterally. Work with the engineers to come up with process improvements collaboratively.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor685"></a>
 Avoid wasting their work</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Imagine you spent all week working on a presentation and then you find out the presentation is canceled. You&apos;d feel frustrated that all your work was wasted. Unfortunately, this happens to engineers more than it should. They finish building something only to learn that the design or requirements are changing and they have to start all over again.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Make sure you&apos;re clear about what product decisions are finalized, and which ones might change. If things might change after a <a id="_idIndexMarker521"></a>
 beta program or an <a id="_idIndexMarker522"></a>
 A/B test, let the engineers know. They might be able to take shortcuts or build in a more flexible way if they anticipate changes.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As much as possible, try to solidify the plans before engineering work starts. Run <a id="_idIndexMarker523"></a>
 usability studies on prototypes. Ask important stakeholders for early feedback. Avoid last minute surprises.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor686" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <a id="_idTextAnchor687" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Working with <a id="_idIndexMarker524" style=";color:black;"></a>
 executives</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Executives can be intimidating, but as you work with them, you&apos;ll understand them better and feel more comfortable around them.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Keep in mind the following points about executives:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">They have very limited time</span>
 . Executives tend to be abrupt and direct. They might not explain themselves. They can be impatient when they feel like someone is wasting their time. They might make you skip around in your presentation, or derail the entire agenda to talk about the points they think are important. They can&apos;t afford to waste time.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">They rely heavily on</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-2"><a id="_idIndexMarker525"></a>
</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-2">trust</span>
 . To save time, executives prefer to rely on people they already trust, such as other managers. They&apos;ll quickly decide how much they trust you. If you don&apos;t sound confident in what you&apos;re saying, or if you&apos;ve made sloppy mistakes, you&apos;ll quickly lose their trust.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">They&apos;re focused on big goals</span>
 . Unless your project has the potential for a big upside, it&apos;s not that important to them. They might encourage you to think much bigger and go after wild ideas, even if pursuing those ideas doesn&apos;t seem practical for your team.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">They&apos;re looking at the big picture.</span>
 Your work is just a tiny piece of a big puzzle. They care about optimizing across all projects more than just within your project. This is why they&apos;ll insist on consistency, shared infrastructure, and future-proof data models.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">They know a lot of context you don&apos;t</span>
 . They&apos;re privy to how the business is doing across all departments. They know what initiatives are on the horizon. They might have secret information about competitive threats, acquisitions, or big deals coming through the pipeline. They know what the board members are worried about. Sometimes their ideas seem random but are connected to that context.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Their job involves making difficult decisions</span>
 . Executives know that they can&apos;t please everyone. They care about your morale, but they&apos;re not afraid to disappoint you. This might desensitize them to bad behavior and lead them to act rudely when they&apos;re frustrated.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">They don&apos;t want you to just blindly follow orders</span>
 . It might sound like they do, but usually that&apos;s a miscommunication. Executives presume that they&apos;ll be correct, but they want you to understand their goals and concerns and come up with a better solution if one exists.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The relationship between PMs and executives is parallel in many ways to the relationship between engineers and PMs. In both cases, one person has broader context, while the other person is closer to the work and getting things done. If you imagine how you&apos;d like engineers to work with you, a lot of that will apply to you working with executives.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-004-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00037.html#endnote-004">4</a>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor688"></a>
 Work for founders and executives that you respect</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Founders and executives shape the culture and direction of a company.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you don&apos;t believe in them or are not aligned with their approaches, you&apos;ll be fighting an uphill battle. You might be protected for a while if you have an excellent manager, but you&apos;ll be at risk if that manager leaves or is blocked by the people above them. It&apos;s unlikely that you&apos;ll see a lot of career advancement, and it probably will not be worth the emotional stress.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A particularly important example of this is with the head of product (or with the founders if you&apos;re the head of product) at a startup. Many PMs are caught by surprise at how involved the head of product can be with every design decision. If you fundamentally respect them, this can be handled with some discussion, gentle nudging, and letting them think that things were their idea. If you don&apos;t respect them, it will be infuriating and you might hit a stalemate.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor689"></a>
 Seek to understand</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It&apos;s surprisingly common for people to brush off ideas from executives. They might assume that the executive is out of touch with reality or too attached to their own ideas. Sometimes, the PM will claim that the executives don&apos;t understand product best practices.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Even if there are elements of truth to those thoughts, you&apos;re doing yourself a disservice if you think of your executives as pointless obstacles in your way. Their ideas might seem strange, but that&apos;s often because they&apos;re viewing things from a much larger perspective than you are. Even when their ideas aren&apos;t directly relevant to the work at hand, it&apos;s often a valuable insight into the bigger picture.</p>
<p class="BODY_Sidebar-Heading" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor690" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Understanding an exec</p>
<p class="BODY_Sidebar" style=";color:black;">Noah Weiss, VP of Product at Slack, had worked with his team to come up with a massive end-to-end overhaul of the customer experience that touched the home page, product positioning, team creation screens and onboarding flows. He warned the CEO, Stewart Butterfield, that this ambitious plan would take time: &quot;We&apos;re not going to see results as quickly with this plan. The curve is not going to bend as quickly.&quot;</p>
<p class="BODY_Sidebar" style=";color:black;">Butterfield replied enigmatically: &quot;You&apos;re thinking about it backwards. If you bend the culture curve, the growth curve will follow.&quot;</p>
<p class="BODY_Sidebar" style=";color:black;">Weiss wasn&apos;t sure what that meant, but the meeting was over so he put it aside. Maybe it just sounded profound but wasn&apos;t.</p>
<p class="BODY_Sidebar" style=";color:black;">Then, the next morning, Weiss had an &quot;aha&quot; moment and understood what Butterfield had meant! To take on a project of this size, he&apos;d have to change the whole culture of how they build product. &quot;If we didn&apos;t change the culture, we couldn&apos;t take on this bet. And if we couldn&apos;t take on this bet, we certainly couldn&apos;t hit our growth goal at the end of the year.&quot;</p>
<p class="BODY_Sidebar" style=";color:black;">Focusing on the culture change turned out to be energizing for the team. Everyone had wanted to do more prototyping, more user testing, and to focus on a cohesive experience, but they hadn&apos;t felt like they had permission before. Now, they effectively had a mandate. It was so successful that the approach spread across teams at Slack.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When you hear ideas from executives, take the opportunity to dig deeper. If you don&apos;t agree with the idea, talk to the executive from the mindset of &quot;I&apos;m probably missing something. Can you explain where my reasoning is wrong here?&quot;</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor691"></a>
 <a id="_idIndexMarker526"></a>
 Validate ideas from executives</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Executives often feel strongly about surprising ideas. Rather than brushing off the idea or blindly charging ahead with it, take the middle ground of finding a way to validate it.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It&apos;s worth it to try to do a little validation, even if you&apos;re dead set against the idea. One of you is wrong—and it could be you.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Even if you like the idea, you should still do <a id="_idIndexMarker527"></a>
 validation, just like you would for any idea your team had. An executive liking an idea isn&apos;t sufficient reason to make a multi-month investment without testing the concept in front of real people. It&apos;s your responsibility to ship successful products, and you don&apos;t get absolved of that responsibility just because an executive asked for the project.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor692"></a>
 Be prepared for your meetings with executives</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Executives can be quick to judge. You don&apos;t want to get on their bad side by showing up unprepared.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Before you present your work to an executive, consider reviewing it with your manager or a mentor. Plan out what you want to say and anticipate possible questions. Look for careless mistakes. Make sure you&apos;ve looked into any important data that&apos;s readily available.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If possible, send them your material in advance and ask them if they have any questions. That will give you time to look up the answers rather than being put on the spot during the meeting. If they do ask you a question where you don&apos;t know the answer, let them know: &quot;I&apos;ll look into that and get back to you.&quot;</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor693"></a>
 Protect your team from thrash</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Sometimes, executives will stop you in the hall and ask you to start working on something. Usually, they don&apos;t actually intend for your team to drop everything and work on the new idea. Even if that is their intention, as a PM, it&apos;s your responsibility to figure out if that is the right decision.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The executive is usually thinking about the urgency and priority of the new work. It&apos;s your job to think about the opportunity cost of stopping the current work. Context switching is costly and teams feel demoralized if they don&apos;t get to ship what they&apos;ve been working on.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Most of the time, you&apos;ll be able to move the ideas to be considered in the next planning cycle, or to start after the current project finishes. But, sometimes you&apos;ll find that the executive is right and it&apos;s worth pausing the current work to take advantage of a new insight or opportunity.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Once you&apos;ve figured out what you feel is the right decision, loop back with the executive to let them know. They might be totally fine that you&apos;ve put the idea on the list of things to consider for next quarter, or they might come back with more reasons to do it sooner.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor694"></a>
 Don&apos;t use &quot;because the executive said so&quot; as your reason</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When I was a new PM, I once told my team we needed to add a new feature because the VP had told us to. I thought this was inspirational; how often would we get a chance to build something that the VP cared about? Apparently, my engineers didn&apos;t think so, and word got around to my manager. My manager sat me down and explained why that&apos;s a bad approach.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In modern tech companies (especially in the US), hierarchy isn&apos;t seen as a good enough reason to do something. Employees don&apos;t assume that the highest up person knows more than they do about their specific work.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">For morale and engagement, it&apos;s important for each person to understand the purpose of their work. They can&apos;t understand the purpose of their work if the only justification they&apos;ve been given is that an executive wanted it.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Instead, make sure that you personally understand the reasons the executive cared about the work, and share those reasons with your team. You don&apos;t even have to mention that an executive asked for the work, unless you think that will motivate your team in a positive way.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor695"></a>
 Don&apos;t throw away their ideas; build on them</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Executives usually get to where they are by being good at their job. They can&apos;t always articulate their reasoning, but they have strong hunches that have often been right.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you come in and tell them that they&apos;re wrong, they probably won&apos;t believe you. They&apos;ll think that <span class="CharOverride-1">you</span>
 are being stubborn by not considering their ideas.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">To avoid this, don&apos;t frame things as &quot;their idea&quot; vs. &quot;your idea.&quot; Instead, frame your idea as something that builds on top of theirs. This neatly steps around issues of <a id="_idIndexMarker528"></a>
 ego or defensiveness and helps you move forward collaboratively.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If they&apos;ve written a product strategy that you disagree with, see how much of it you can reuse in your new version. Perhaps...</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">… their old strategy becomes &quot;Part 8&quot; of a 10-part plan, after hitting a few important earlier milestones.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">… you can keep the features the same and regroup them, or keep the groupings the same and put in new features.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">… some sentences from the intro can be reused directly. You can tell them you loved the strategy and just reorganized it and filled it out a little bit.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If they&apos;ve given you a terrible idea during design review, mock up that idea and a few more good ones. You can show them what you liked and didn&apos;t like about their idea, and then give it credit for inspiring you to think of even more good solutions. For example: &quot;I loved the idea of making it more visual, so I tried your idea of using photography in the background, and then also tried adding some illustrations on top.&quot;</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If they&apos;ve got a meeting or process that doesn&apos;t work, frame your suggestions as small adjustments on top of what they&apos;ve already put together, even if your changes are actually large. It&apos;s even better if you can volunteer to be responsible for those adjustments rather than asking them to take it on.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">One of my direct reports successfully used this approach with me:</p>
<p class="BODY_Quote">I love that you&apos;ve put together a weekly team meeting. Now that people have so many topics, I&apos;m thinking it might be even better if we put together an agenda in advance. If you&apos;d like I can take care of gathering the topics.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I was incredibly thankful for his initiative, and his framing made it easier for me to accept the help.</p>

 Key Takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Treat your coworkers like partners, not resources</span>
 : It takes people of all departments and disciplines to create a successful product and company. Especially for design and engineering, but also for roles like user research, data science, and marketing, you&apos;ll get better results if you include them in decisions and value their opinions.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Invest in understanding other people&apos;s jobs</span>
 : The more you learn about your coworkers responsibilities, processes, goals, and worries, the better you&apos;ll be able to collaborate with them. Many PMs make mistakes because they didn&apos;t understand where the other person was coming from.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Directives from executives are just a starting point</span>
 : When an executive tells you to build a feature, that&apos;s not permission to skip product best practices. Don&apos;t dismiss the idea or rush ahead to implement it. Just like you wouldn&apos;t take a customer request at face value, you should investigate the executive request to understand the underlying need.</li>
