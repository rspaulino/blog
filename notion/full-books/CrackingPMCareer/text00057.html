 How did you get into product management?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">My start in tech was doing my own startup. It was an opportunity to learn what the ecosystem of technology looks like. I had to teach myself how to code, sell my vision and dream to others, and really forge a path. In the early parts of your career, you have to prove your <a id="_idIndexMarker885"></a>
 credibility. The startup opened doors for me because people thought my product was interesting and elegant, but I was never able to find product-market-fit.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">After that startup failed, which happens often in Silicon Valley but is rarely talked about, I reached out to my network to find my next job. Since they knew me personally and had context on my startup idea, I wrote and asked for advice on what the next steps were to continue on in tech.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">What goes unspoken about a lot of career moves is that you need a safe place to land—a place where you feel like you are going to learn and advance your skills, but also be able to find basic comforts and get a salary. A friend of mine from business school was working in DirectTV&apos;s Digital Innovation Lab (DLab) and said I should apply.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I joined DirectTV and helped with new product creation in this 30-person group where we were thinking about the future of media consumption. That lab was the right blend for me: it was like a startup but it also allowed me to codify the things I&apos;d learned in my startup.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">Oftentimes in a startup you are just doing things by the seat of your pants. You don&apos;t really think about the process and best practices.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">At the DLab, I spent time putting pen to paper around how I wanted to lead a product team, how I wanted to think about data visualization, and what my leadership would look like with intentionality.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">The takeaways for me were around getting good at cross functional communication in a structured environment and figuring out how to be a great partner to data and design. I believe that the superpowers of PMs are being great at data visualization and understanding how to tell the story through data.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1089" style=";color:black;"></a>
 How did you find your niche in growth?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A friend from college submitted my resume to Facebook&apos;s internal referral tool, and I was able to get through their very rigorous interview process. I only expected to be there for two years (and then join another startup), but I ultimately stayed for four and a half years. I chose to work on growth because Facebook had built the first consumer product growth team and I knew that it would be the best place to learn a skill that I believed every tech company would eventually need.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">Your career is going to take you to different places, but the best thing you can do is to lean into the strengths of the company you&apos;re at. If your company is world class at something, then you should become world class at that thing. You can springboard your career off the back of that competency.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Product management is a very high EQ and high skilled job, but the differentiation in various product management roles is hard to understand. The extent to which you can carve a niche for yourself can make you more hireable and more desirable.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In my case, there&apos;s only about two handfuls of PMs who have been in a leadership position for a company that&apos;s crossed a billion users. And so, that was my niche.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1090" style=";color:black;"></a>
 What led you to move from the Facebook Growth Team to Instagram?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I worked on the Facebook Growth Team for two years. It was challenging because it was very demanding, and they didn&apos;t focus on people development at that time. I didn&apos;t feel supported. I felt like I was running 1,000 miles an hour, but not progressing. That was a pretty seminal time in my career because I had to figure out a framework for thinking about if I should leave and why I should leave.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">I had an epiphany one day—my impact at a place was equal to the product of my personal abilities multiplied by the environment.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">My personal abilities were the product of my ability to communicate, to execute, to think strategically, to work cross functional teams, and so on. But, the environment was the multiplicative product of things like manager support, resourcing, scope, fairness of evaluation, etc.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If any of the things in the environmental bucket were effectively zero, it didn&apos;t matter how much harder I worked on the personal side. The impact would still net out to zero. When I articulated this, I was able to have an honest conversation with myself about the extent to which I believed I could change any of those environmental factors.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I decided to leave the Facebook group and looked at jobs elsewhere. I chose Instagram because it gave me a foundation in terms of being able to stay in the same company with the same infrastructure and communication tools, while pivoting to a new product. I felt like the product was well-loved and ripe for having a breakout, but was also still small and needed the right people.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">People internally thought it was a terrible move for me because at the time, Instagram was known for being &quot;design first.&quot; The founders had only reluctantly decided to start a growth organization. It turns out it was the perfect lucky opportunity for me.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Because the founders were very design focused and focused on doing the right thing for the customer, it made me a better product manager and product leader. Facebook had a history and reputation of doing whatever it took to grow.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The founders of Instagram were unwilling to compromise the quality of the product for the sake of growth. If we had two options—one with a worse user experience but would increase monthly active users by ten million annually, and another with a far better experience but would only increase by seven million—we would ship the latter. We would leave the three million on the table to offer a better experience.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">I believe over the long term that kind of decision-making—based on product principles and real jobs to be done by users—pays dividends, because the product feels more intentional and less spammy.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">Another thing that made this a great outcome was that the team was very small and there was no pressure. It was counterintuitive, but the smaller team effectively allowed us and forced us to focus on what really mattered.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Instead of doing all the things, we could only do a handful of things really, really well. I work in a space where if you don&apos;t execute perfectly, nothing works. You have to execute perfectly end to end. I was able to spend time with people and take the time to change the processes and culture without having the founders questioning why we weren&apos;t growing fast enough.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1091" style=";color:black;"></a>
 What was your time leading growth at Instagram like?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Growth is effectively a product group that focuses on what we call the adjacent user.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-001-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00057.html#endnote-001">1</a>
</span>
</span>
 Instead of the power user, it&apos;s the person who is struggling to adopt the product. In order to build for them, you need to build products in a way that really solves pain points for people at every step.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When I arrived, the team had just shipped a new registration flow and was planning to move on to the next thing. I convinced them that we needed to change those plans by showing them how there was so much more work to be done. We ended up working on improving registration really intensely for 18 months. I sat down with people and showed them how to think about each step from the lens of the adjacent user. I explained the importance of implementing logging. We brainstormed around the dropoff on each step. We went over the difference between things that were practical versus beautiful. I helped build reinforcing communication structures so we would learn from whatever we launched.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">At the beginning of that time, 65% of people who started registration completed it. We got it up to 95%, which is huge for a registration flow that has 1.5 million people going through it a day. That&apos;s orders of magnitude more people who experienced the product for the first time, and it was one of many dramatic improvements we made to our signup, activation, and other core flows for new and resurrected users.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">That experience was fantastic. For me, it became a signature win at a known brand because we were able to reach a monumental milestone at a company.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">When I think about career moves, what I recommend to people is to look for the conditions that are right for a signature win. That&apos;s more important than optimizing for the title.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">After that, the product was doing well and there was a ton of opportunity. I was able to show how we were leaving so much on the table due to lack of resources and lack of people. I made a case that helped us get some of the headcount that we needed. From there, my scope grew naturally and I became a people manager.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I don&apos;t want to make it seem like this was all perfectly organic though. I certainly had to self-advocate for things like recognition. What I&apos;d say was important there was having monthly conversations with my manager about professional development and progress towards personal and team goals. I also needed to explicitly call out the constraints under which work got done so that people didn&apos;t underestimate the challenge.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">For example, my first year at Instagram we grew almost 50%, which was much better than anyone expected. My first-half review reflected that but my second-half review didn&apos;t, although we&apos;d done even better during the second half. And, I&apos;d accomplished that while going on parental leave for six weeks and setting up the team so I didn&apos;t need a backfill.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">There was a clear gap of awareness of what it took to accomplish those things. Some of that gap was on me and some of that was on the people around me, but it was a good lesson for me about the importance of shared clarity and alignment.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1092" style=";color:black;"></a>
 What led you to move on from Instagram?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When the founders left Instagram, I needed to decide as a leader if I was willing to make a commitment for the long haul. I felt like if I stayed relatively long at Instagram beyond when the founders left, I owed it to my team to see that through. I had built a great team that could do the work without me, I had a clear successor, and I had a really strong team with really strong processes. I felt like I&apos;d maximized my time at Facebook.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I moved to Instacart as VP of Product because I felt like it was a great opportunity. It appealed to me that they had a huge market and they were the strategic leader. Unfortunately I was very burned out after years of grinding at FB Inc and not taking care of my body. I should have taken time off between roles, and, after a year at Instacart, I decided to take the time to work on my health and spend time with my kids (much more than I ever imagined due to COVID!).</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1093" style=";color:black;"></a>
 What advice would you give to PMs who want to advance in their careers?</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">Early in your career, you really need to build a lot of muscle around product sense and building things that have clear user value and solve jobs to be done in a simple and impactful way for users.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">One way to do that is to be around strong thinkers who can push you to think from first principles by breaking down opportunities to their atomic units, prioritizing and executing effectively, editing down the scope of your product to what really matters, and incorporating a sense of craft and delight. Essentially, you need to be able to take a wide open canvas and figure out how to think about it, identify the right segments, and come up with a solution that&apos;s meaningful and differentiated. And you do that again and again with less help over time.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">For mid-career PMs, two things matter: the ability to create and get buy-in around a great strategy and the ability to drive cross functional influence.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Cross-functional influence is really about building relationships and building strong communication channels. There&apos;s a lot of overlap with networking for a job search. A lot of things get done behind the scenes in every company. If I&apos;m going to create a new strategy for the growth of Instagram, I&apos;m not going to show up and just deliver this whole thing to the founders and everyone without getting some buy-in or early thinking. You have to understand how to get the right cues so you&apos;re not reading the room for the first time during your final presentation.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1094" style=";color:black;"></a>
 What has helped you as a leader?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">One of the things that was most helpful for me was getting an executive <a id="_idIndexMarker886"></a>
 coach.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Finding the right person who fits your communication style and your operating style matters, but they&apos;re also valuable because they&apos;ve seen so much. The challenge is, the more senior you get, the more lumpy the cadence is for seeing certain types of problems. A coach can help you pattern match and work through them.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I&apos;ve also worked with my coach on professional development the same way I would with a manager, talking about what I want to achieve and breaking down the steps to get there.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">There are challenges, especially in careers like product, where understanding the nuance of certain situations and having shared cultural context is helpful.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I mentor a lot of people of color and women on how to navigate a situation as someone who&apos;s not of the majority group in the room. It&apos;s helpful to have a coach who&apos;s aware of those dynamics and will be honest about it. For example, there are common challenges around how to give feedback and express concerns in a way that you won&apos;t be unduly criticized for.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">Another challenge is finding a <a id="_idIndexMarker887"></a>
 sponsor. The notion of becoming a sponsor is predicated on pattern matching for people who look like you. What I&apos;ve learned is that I need to ask for sponsorship.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-002-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00057.html#endnote-002">2</a>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I&apos;ve had the sponsorship conversation as part of a professional development question where they ask what I care about in my career. I&apos;d say, &quot;It really matters to me that I&apos;m on a clear path towards this level and this set of scope. I believe that I need sponsorship to get there. I want to know if you&apos;re willing to be the sponsor for me or if you can help me figure out how I can achieve that.&quot; You have to be explicit about your goals and be your own advocate to break through to the executive levels of an organization.</p>
