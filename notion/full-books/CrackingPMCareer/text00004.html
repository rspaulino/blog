<p class="First-Paragraph---Main-Book">
<span class="AllCaps-Bold _idGenCharOverride-1">Unicorns. I never</span>
 thought that I&apos;d be at this point in my career and trying to justify their existence, but PMing is funny that way. Sometimes your product needs a mythical beast. Or, at least I thought so.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Let me explain.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">At Asana, we had a secret feature where users could turn on unicorn celebrations when they completed a task. Customers were delighted. Who wouldn&apos;t love a literal unicorn flying across their screen?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It turns out that the people who thought it was a virus weren&apos;t so crazy about the introduction of this possibly diseased beast. Also, it did seem a bit goofy for our business customers.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I was stuck. Logically, their points made sense. It could be jarring for our more serious users, and I could see where a less tech-savvy person might reasonably mistake our clip-art unicorn for a symptom of a computer issue.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">At the same time, I believed in this feature. It offered a little treat for a &quot;job well done.&quot; The reception was fairly positive, and I thought this feature would boost word of mouth.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">My believing in it wasn&apos;t enough though; it&apos;s not like I could demand that everyone do what I wanted.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As I had instructed my mentees so many times, a PM can&apos;t just issue orders. They have to develop the frameworks, gather the data, consider the risks, and motivate people to align along some vision, goal or task.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This is the essence of what makes PMing so thorny. There are such a variety of multifaceted problems with so many stakeholders. Sure, we get more skilled as our career progresses—but then we face more complex problems and bigger goals. It&apos;s like we&apos;re perpetually fumbling in the dark for the light switch, but only finding a little flashlight.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor004" style=";color:black;"></a>
 A hope that this book illuminates.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A good PM has goals, and this book—being a product itself—is no exception. These are our goals.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"></a>
 Our goal is for this book to be the guide we never had.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As a fresh PM, starting out at Microsoft, I had mentors and advice—but it wasn&apos;t comprehensive. No one could sit me down and teach me all of what it means to be a PM, and what it takes to become a fantastic one. It&apos;s not that they didn&apos;t try; there&apos;s just too much to say. I couldn&apos;t envision how the complexity of my problems would evolve with my career path.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">While I was at Google—starting in the <a id="_idIndexMarker000"></a>
 APM program—I continued to learn a great deal about building awesome products. But the complexity of the decisions grew. No longer did my work fit into a clear structure with defined projects and preset deadlines. I now needed to work with my team to decide what projects to tackle and when they should ship. I was expected to manage stakeholders and strategy—as well as my own career. I gobbled up all the information my mentors fed me, but I still felt like I was messing it up as often as I got it right.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"></a>
 Our goal is for this book to be the guide our mentees never had.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I joined Asana as their 13th employee and first PM. Now, it truly felt like it was all on me. No longer did I have premade launch checklists and spec templates. There was no super senior PM I could look to to see if I was on the right track. I was wearing those shoes now.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Over eight years, as Asana grew to more than 500 employees, I rose into the head of product management role, overseeing the product roadmap and a team of 20 PMs. I launched Asana&apos;s APM program and aspired to do everything right that my mentors had, nothing they did wrong, and then add on a few bits of awesomeness too.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">That&apos;s a ridiculous, lofty goal—impossible to achieve—but that&apos;s okay. I&apos;d like to think that I came pretty close.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Over the years, I&apos;ve learned and grown so much. I&apos;ve been mentored and supported by amazing people. I&apos;ve made mistakes and learned from them. I&apos;ve had major successes and learned from them. I&apos;ve written job ladders and hired PMs. And I turned all of this into mentoring and supporting PMs—as APMs freshly out of college, as PMs growing into more senior roles, and now in the form of this book.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"></a>
 Our goal is for this book to help more people become great product managers.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This book shares the skills, frameworks, and practices that my peers and I have painstakingly learned and honed over the years, so that PMs can spend less time reinventing the wheel. It delves into the mystery and ambiguity surrounding career progression so that PMs can focus on the right areas and reach their potential. It connects the dots on how to develop each important PM skill so that mentors can point their mentees towards actionable feedback.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Of course, there is no such thing as a perfect PM, and there&apos;s no such thing as a perfect mentor. But we hope that this book will make things a little bit easier. Read it cover-to-cover, or sample the sections you like, or let it sit on your desk as a reference to flip to—or have your mentees flip to—as needed. The choice is yours.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor008" style=";color:black;"></a>
 On mythical beasts</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As for the unicorn celebrations, it launched in the end. We aligned the team together under a broad agreement about testing and measuring customer reactions. A designer worked to make the design match our brand and added an explanation on the first unicorn, so it didn&apos;t get mistaken for a virus. And we launched initially just for personal use cases, though we promoted it to organizations later. Internal stakeholders were happy and customers were delighted.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Now, years later, as I write this book, I&apos;m on the other side—checking tasks off on Asana, and watching unicorns shoot across the screen. Perhaps I&apos;m biased, but it does give me a little smile every time.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor009" style=";color:black;"></a>
 How To Use This Book</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This book is for anyone who wants to become a great product leader. You might choose to read it straight through, but you can also skip around—we give you some pointers on doing that (see <a href="text00004.html#_idTextAnchor013">&quot;If you&apos;re short on time...&quot;</a>
 ).</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In the book <span class="CharOverride-1">Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise</span>
 , Anders Ericsson and Robert Pool study the question of how people develop their potential and achieve greatness. The key takeaway is that your expertise is driven by the quality of your mental representations. For example, when chess grandmasters look at a chess board, they don&apos;t see a scattering of pieces; they see an in-progress game where white played the queen&apos;s gambit and black declined.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">To get the most out of this book, focus on developing your mental representations around products, businesses, and people. Create and refine your own frameworks. Apply deliberate practice by comparing your intuitive behaviors to those of the best PMs. When you do this well, new situations you&apos;re faced with won&apos;t feel like total unknowns. Instead, they&apos;ll each feel like a variation of a pattern you recognize.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">With practice, you too will hear an engineer complain about technical debt and say, &quot;Ah, this is the classic <a id="_idIndexMarker001"></a>
 roadmap conflict caused by prioritizing disparate goals in a single ranked list, and easily solved with a balanced portfolio roadmap.&quot;<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">
<span id="endnote-001-backlink">
<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00004.html#endnote-001">1</a>
</span>
</span>
 It doesn&apos;t quite have the ring of &quot;the queen&apos;s gambit declined,&quot; but it will do.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"></a>
 PM Skills</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Every company uses different top-level categories to describe the skills and attributes of great PMs. Fortunately, the underlying elements are remarkably consistent. All companies want you to efficiently deliver high-quality products that create customer and business impact without causing problems.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In this book, we&apos;ve grouped the skills it takes to be a great product leader into five categories:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Product</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-2">skills</span>

 PM Career Ladder</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Unlike most leveling frameworks and PM career ladders, this book does not create a rubric that describes what each skill looks like at every job level.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Why?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Those types of rubrics are either unhelpfully vague or misleadingly specific. They either use subjective qualifiers or list bullet points that aren&apos;t applied consistently. Often, they just self-referentially describe the scope you&apos;ve been assigned.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The underlying truth is that PM skills don&apos;t translate directly into levels. Instead, your level is determined by your scope, autonomy, and impact. The way you earn a promotion to the next level is by demonstrating autonomy and impact at your current scope and building trust that you can perform at a larger scope.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">

<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The PM skills are incredibly important for becoming a better PM and launching great products, but they don&apos;t create a guide for how to advance.</p>
