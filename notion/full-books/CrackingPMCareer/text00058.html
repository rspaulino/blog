<span class="AllCaps-Bold _idGenCharOverride-1" style=";color:black;">Sara Mauskopf</span>
 is the CEO and cofounder of Winnie (<a href="https://winnie.com/" style=";color:black;">winnie.com</a>
 ), a marketplace for daycare and preschool helping millions of parents across the United States. Sara has a background in consumer technology and product management. Prior to founding Winnie, she was the director of product at Postmates, and prior to that held product leadership roles at Twitter, YouTube, and Google. She graduated with a computer science and engineering degree from MIT. She&apos;s also a mom of three young children.</p>
<p class="BODY_Intro-Bio" style=";color:black;">twitter: @<a href="http://twitter.com/sm" style=";color:black;">sm</a>
</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1099" style=";color:black;"></a>
 How did you get into product management?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I went to MIT and studied computer science. The cool thing to do at the time when I graduated was to get a job at Google. A lot of people were interviewing for engineering positions, but I hadn&apos;t taken very many coding-heavy classes and wasn&apos;t sure I could pass the engineering interview. I&apos;d taken a lot of math and theoretical computer science classes. At the time, Google was hiring for a position that was a cross between product management and partnerships. I interviewed for that and got the job. And so, I moved out to California and started working for Google.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I realized that I liked the product management aspects of the job more than the partner management aspects, so I started looking for true product manager positions after three years at Google. I was a big Twitter user at the time and a few of my friends had left Google to go there.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Twitter was hiring for a product manager position on the internal tools team. I thought it would be a great way to get started as a product manager, because the stakes were a little lower. I&apos;d be building tools for the company instead of millions of users. It was a great experience.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">When you join a growing company, there will be more positions that open up and more opportunities.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">At one point, the VP of Product had left the company and I looked for a team where I could work on the core product. I found a more experienced PM who took me under his wing and said I could work with his team. When a new product leader came, I was already working on the core product.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">One of the things I learned was that if you can find people and build relationships with them, they will help you. Especially if you&apos;re working hard, capable, and smart, they&apos;ll give you opportunities to try things out. Take those opportunities to prove yourself.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I ended up spending four years at Twitter as a product manager. I got to grow with the company and manage teams.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1100" style=";color:black;"></a>
 What led you to move on from Twitter?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I had an amazing career at Twitter. I was rising super fast. Then, I suddenly stopped rising at that rate. I went to an exec and asked what was going on. He said to me, &quot;You&apos;re good, but you&apos;re not one of those world class guys yet.&quot; That phrase hit me and I thought, &quot;Whoa, you only promoted guys to those director positions. There are no women in those roles… because you think that to be world class… you have to be a guy.&quot; And so I left.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I joined Postmates as their head of product, reporting to the CEO, and I got to build my product team from scratch. I&apos;d been talking to the CEO for a few months, mostly as a big user of the product. I&apos;ve always found that when I&apos;m really <a id="_idIndexMarker888"></a>
 authentic and I really do like a product or respect a person, they are usually able to give me at least a few minutes if I reach out directly.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I was looking for opportunities where the team was small enough that they would take a chance on me as a product leader, but not so small that the company wouldn&apos;t be around in a couple of months. I wanted some job security and some brand reputation associated with the company. I also really wanted to work for a company where I knew the people were very solid.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">All of that turned out to be true at Postmates. My current cofounder at Winnie, our head of engineering, and one of our salespeople are all from Postmates. They were really amazing people and I was excited to work with them again.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1101" style=";color:black;"></a>
 What inspired you to start your own company?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It was not long into my time at Postmates that I became pregnant and then had my first daughter. I was there about a year when I went out on maternity leave, and I had every intention of my daughter having absolutely no impact on my life or career aspirations.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Of course, like many other parents, I had no idea what I was getting into. My desire to go back to work didn&apos;t change, but the problems I cared about solving really did change. The kind of culture and environment I wanted to work at changed. I wanted to go to work, do my best work for the limited hours I was in the office, and then go home and turn off work entirely. Postmates has its busiest hours at night and on the weekends, which was exactly the time I didn&apos;t want to be working.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">At the same time, I was talking to my coworker, who is now my cofounder at Winnie. We were both bonding over the struggles of working parents and all the things we had to balance. We realized there was an opportunity to actually work on these problems. We decided to quit our jobs and started working on Winnie in January 2016.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">I&apos;d never seen myself as a founder. What motivated me was that there was no company solving this problem.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Parents struggle to find childcare providers (such as daycares and preschools) with capacity and many providers don&apos;t even have a web presence. Providers who have excess space struggle to find parents. The opportunity was so big that I just couldn&apos;t wrap my head around how I could not do this. It felt like my cofounder and I were uniquely positioned to solve this problem at the intersection of technology and childcare. If we didn&apos;t do this, we were passing on a massive opportunity in front of us.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1102" style=";color:black;"></a>
 How might a PM know if being a founder and CEO would be a good match for them?</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">Now that I am a CEO, I&apos;ve learned that it is not even close to being a product manager.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In fact, I don&apos;t even work on the product here at Winnie. My cofounder is the chief product officer and I sometimes don&apos;t see product improvements until our users see them. Sometimes, my product background even hinders my ability to see solutions that are not about building product but more about building a team.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">The way I think of the CEO role is that you&apos;re always working on the next thing for the company and figuring out what should be next.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Right now, I&apos;m spending all my time doing sales, operations and marketing. I&apos;m trying to figure out what teams we put in place to manage those critical but newer functions.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Once I spend long enough doing these jobs, I should either figure out that we need to make an investment here in actual people, or that these are not jobs worth doing. I would say 50% of my time is doing things that I end up deciding are not worth anyone&apos;s time. They&apos;re the least significant things in the company to do. And the other 50% are realizing that these are actually jobs to be done and they need to be part of someone&apos;s role. They need to be hired for or we need to somehow make it so that this work gets done.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">My take is that if people actually knew what being a founder was like, fewer people would want to attempt it. It&apos;s really, really challenging. But at the end of the day, there&apos;s also nothing I&apos;d rather be doing right now with my time. I&apos;m really motivated by the problem I&apos;m solving and the impact I&apos;m having.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1103" style=";color:black;"></a>
 What do you think makes a successful founder?</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">The key difference between successful founders and unsuccessful founders is often just perseverance.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There&apos;s a &quot;trough of despair&quot; that new companies frequently hit where all signs point to the fact that you should quit. You&apos;ve run out of money. You&apos;ve run out of employees. Everything is going wrong. You&apos;re going to get so many signs that this is no longer something you could possibly feasibly continue working on, and there has to be that speck of motivation that tells you, &quot;Just give it one more try. Keep going for a little longer.&quot; That speck is sometimes the difference between success and failure.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There are so many better ways to accomplish fame and fortune than this. So many easier, more foolproof ways.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1104" style=";color:black;"></a>
 What advice would you give to a PM who wants to advance in their career?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">One is to get experience outside of your core PM job, because it will make you a better PM. Answer support tickets. Join sales calls. That will expand your brain and make you so much better at what you&apos;re trying to do as a product manager and eventually any other job that you want to do.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Understand how the financials of your company work. I spent absolutely no time caring about financials when I was working at these massive companies like Google and Twitter. It turns out, what I spend the majority of my time on as a CEO is just making sure we have enough money in the bank for a long enough time. Having those experiences will help you advance your career and make connections that other people won&apos;t see or think of.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Don&apos;t be afraid to roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty. Some of those jobs may feel below you, but they can be great experiences.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Finally, focus on the people more than the results. Focus on how you can help the engineers and designers you&apos;re working with every day to be successful. Focus on how you can help the other product managers be successful. It&apos;s not just about the success you achieve; it&apos;s about how you help other people achieve success.</p>
