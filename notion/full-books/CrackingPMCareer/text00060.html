 How did you get into product management?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I was a chemical engineering graduate from IIT Kanpur in 2005 and I always knew that I wanted to build something for consumers on the internet. I started as a front end engineer at a couple of startups and developed a deep empathy for the consumer.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Around that time, Flipkart had started in India, selling books like Amazon. During my interview, the CEO said he thought I&apos;d be great as a product manager. I thought product management would mean I wouldn’t be a builder anymore, so I initially resisted—but he insisted. That&apos;s how I became a product manager by accident. I&apos;ve never looked back.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When I joined Flipkart, I saw that nobody had time to look through all the user flows and connect the dots. So, I thought of myself as two things:</p>
<ol>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1" value="1">The fluid that connects all of the different areas: business, engineering, leadership, strategy, and so on.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1" value="2">The subject matter expert on e-commerce.</li>
</ol>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">At the time, India didn&apos;t really have product managers, so a few of us decided that we had to set the tone for product management in India. Companies were borrowing concepts from Silicon Valley, but they weren&apos;t borrowing the cultural aspects. Founders and CEOs wanted to manage things in a very hands-on way, and they didn&apos;t know how to trust a product manager.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">It&apos;s still a little tougher to be a product manager in India because you&apos;re not only building up your own career, but you also have to develop other people&apos;s trust in product management and teach them what to expect from a product manager.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1117" style=";color:black;"></a>
 What led you to Walmart Labs and Snapdeal?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I moved to Walmart Labs because, while Flipkart was doing great, I wanted to see a company at a global scale. I used to lead Store Services, which included anything that started online and ended offline or that started offline and got home-delivered (such as Pharmacy, Photos, or Tires). It was a big charter with big revenue potential. I thought it was great—and it was, if you&apos;re only looking for impact. But at the time, it was not great for moving fast. I was still young; I wanted to make a huge impact and didn&apos;t want to wait.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I was really getting good at e-commerce, so that&apos;s when I joined Snapdeal. It was one of the up-and-coming startups in India. It had the sharpest rise and the largest fall.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I joined as an associate vice president, leading buyers experience. I started with a few PMs reporting to me and grew the team multifold.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When you lead a team of product managers, it&apos;s a big responsibility. The decisions you make on strategy need to make sense. You need to think through all of the alternatives and be able to explain why you&apos;re deploying capital and manpower in a certain way or why you&apos;re prioritizing someone else&apos;s project. People need to understand your reasoning and be bought into it so they can explain it to their own teams.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">What success looks like for me is not only building products, but actually developing great product managers. I think the way the Indian startup ecosystem will create great consumer products is if some leaders put in the effort to help build great product managers.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1118" style=";color:black;"></a>
 What led you to Swiggy?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">After Snapdeal, I joined Swiggy, a food delivery app. When I joined, it was very small. I&apos;d been doing e-commerce for a long time and I thought food delivery would be simple compared to what I&apos;d done before.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The complexity with food delivery is that not only do you need to match buyers, sellers, and drivers in real time, but there are also millions of product combinations as well. You have a perishable commodity that is deteriorating with time. You might think you want to eat pizza, but end up buying pasta. The platforms which are most successful are the ones which don&apos;t only get you to what you want to buy, but also what the platforms need to sell.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I love this. This problem will keep me interested for the next ten years.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1119" style=";color:black;"></a>
 What are your thoughts on product management in India?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Before 2016, a lot of leaders of product companies came from non-technology companies. They didn&apos;t know what product management, or even software development, was, and so PMs would spend a lot of time influencing leadership and convincing them of the value of product management. It was easy for traditional leaders to play to their strength and neglect the technology part. What I&apos;ve seen is that some PMs got frustrated with that and moved to companies in the US.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">But, since around 2016, things have been changing. A lot of good product people have been starting to settle here. The market is huge and the potential is immense. The challenges are complex: there are 25 different languages, a wide variety of age groups, infrastructural challenges, fraud, and so on. As a product person, you have to solve these really challenging problems and it&apos;s very exciting, but also a little tough.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">I feel very passionately that if India&apos;s startup ecosystem is going to evolve, India&apos;s product leaders have to be really, really good. They have to be independent, not just copying another product or taking business requirements.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I want to build an engine of people who can build an engine of people who are all strong, independent product thinkers. When I work with product managers at Swiggy, I&apos;m not training them just for Swiggy; I&apos;m hoping they will help evolve the entire startup ecosystem.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor1120" style=";color:black;"></a>
 What advice do you have for people who want to advance in their career?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you&apos;re an early stage product manager, think about what the next five years will look like for you. Don&apos;t think in short-term spurts. If you think about what sector you want to be in, you can plan out the skills you need to develop and which companies or people will help you get there.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Three things are important for product management:</p>
<ol>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1" value="1">To have a lot of grit and passion. With grit comes curiosity and not giving up.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1" value="2">Superior written and verbal communication, leading to proper influence. You&apos;ll need to represent your product, your company, and your stakeholders with your communication.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1" value="3">Problem identification and solving. Product management isn&apos;t just about connecting engineers to designers; it&apos;s about solving problems.<p class="BODY_Emphasis _idGenParaOverride-1">At mid-career, you can decide if you want to be a specialist or generalist. If you want to be a generalist, you should make sure you&apos;re a generalist who has enough expertise to solve the problems of an entire industry.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">For example, with e-commerce, there are seven big areas, including search, reviews, and payments. You can spend six months going deep into each area. Every quarter, when we discuss the review scores of product managers on my team, I&apos;m looking to see them dive deep in a field.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As a PM, you&apos;re both very creative and very scientific at the same time.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You break down observations into why and how they happened, which leads to insights. A single insight can lead to multiple hypotheses (how can I use this insight to change behaviour?). A single hypothesis could be (in)validated through different experiments or rollouts. Experiments lead to more observations. It&apos;s a loop!</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You think about human psychology and habits. Over time, as you follow this process, you start understanding patterns that are specific to your business or industry.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">As a product person, you should be trying to become the best person to understand how the system works and how you can make it work better. Keep evolving your frameworks. Everything else revolves around that.</p>
