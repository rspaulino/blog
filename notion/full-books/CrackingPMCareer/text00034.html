<p class="First-Paragraph---Main-Book">
<span class="AllCaps-Bold _idGenCharOverride-1">Steve was probably</span>
 the twentieth person to tell me about foam rollers. He actually gasped a little when I told him I hadn&apos;t used them. &quot;I don&apos;t know how I would live without my foam roller!&quot;, he said.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The first nineteen-ish people extolled the virtues to me of how they would ease my chronic shoulder pain—how the rolling helps with this and the pressure helps with that. And it&apos;s not that I didn&apos;t believe them; it just never rose to the top of my list.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">But Steve&apos;s personal story and enthusiasm popped the importance up a few levels on the stack. I bought one that day.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Truth be told, Steve is actually Dr. Steve. My doctor. He <span class="CharOverride-1">could have</span>
 given me a chart of reasons and details and benefits. But what he grasped, perhaps from years in the medical profession trying to get resistant patients to change their behavior, is that reasons aren&apos;t always enough to motivate. To motivate—as a doctor or a leader must—sometimes you need to <span class="CharOverride-1">inspire</span>
 .</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">Some leaders who are great at motivating and inspiring others are outspoken and charismatic. Others are authentic and personal. Some speak so rarely that everyone quiets down and leans in when they have something to say.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you think about the times people have gotten you excited about an idea, you&apos;re likely to notice a variety of styles. To be a great leader, you don&apos;t need to match a particular style, but you do need a way to make the people around you <span class="CharOverride-1">want</span>
 to follow.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor607" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Responsibilities</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor608"></a>
 Keep your teammates motivated</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">People are not robots. You&apos;ll get more out of your team if you figure out how to motivate and inspire them. They&apos;re more likely to work harder if they care about the work and they think it will help out teammates they care about. Morale matters.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There are many ways to motivate people, and what motivates one person won&apos;t always motivate another. Some people are driven by the purpose and impact of their work, some are more excited by gaining skills and mastery, and others are more inspired by trying to beat the competition. Understanding what motivates different people on your team will help you create a successful team.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you&apos;re not sure what motivates someone, you can ask them questions such as: What brought you to this company? What&apos;s your favorite part of your job? What are you excited about?</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor609"></a>
 Inspire executives and people across the company to believe in your team&apos;s work <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The team you&apos;re responsible for represents a major investment for the company.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When people believe that your team is on the right track to deliver a huge impact, a lot of good things happen. It becomes much easier to advocate for the resources you need. You and your team get the recognition you deserve. People across the company feel excited about the future of the company, and employee <a id="_idIndexMarker486"></a>
 retention improves.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The best tools you have for inspiration are your vision, your track record, and your enthusiasm. Reinforce the higher purpose of your team&apos;s work and successes to the rest of the company. Volunteer to be a guest presenter at the team meetings of other functions or divisions. Share your <a id="_idIndexMarker487"></a>
 elevator pitch with executives if you ever meet them serendipitously, or request a brief meeting if you don&apos;t run into them organically.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor610"></a>
 Recruit people to your team <span class="Chili-Pepper">⚡⚡</span>
</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As you advance, you become responsible for attracting engineers, designers, and PMs to your team. At a small company, this might involve pitching external candidates. At a large company, you might focus on convincing internal people to transfer to your team.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Keep your eyes open for people you&apos;d want to work with, and then talk to them about your team. Share your vision and try to get them excited about it. Let them know why you picked them and why you think they&apos;d be a great match. Learn about what they care about and make sure they know everything that might convince them to join.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">For more information on pitching external candidates, read <a href="text00043.html#_idTextAnchor790">&quot;Learn how to successfully pitch candidates&quot; in Chapter 30</a>

<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor611" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Growth Practices</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor612"></a>
 Build up your internal conviction</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The best way to inspire others is to truly believe in what you&apos;re doing, and to truly believe that what you&apos;re motivating other people to do is good for them.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Some people are too humble to see how wonderful their work is. Try thinking about why you&apos;ve chosen the team you&apos;re on and the work you&apos;re doing, or at least why you haven&apos;t switched to another team. Pretend you&apos;re a visionary leader and think of what they would say to inspire people about your work. Try asking teammates or mentors that you find inspiring how they would talk about your team.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">Remember that growth is multifaceted. Just because your work has some problems or downsides doesn&apos;t mean that there aren&apos;t positives that outweigh those downsides. For a moment, you&apos;ll have to take off the PM hat that&apos;s always looking for risks.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you truly can&apos;t build up your internal conviction, that might be a sign that you should move to a new team or product.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor613"></a>
 Use motivation to hit <a id="_idIndexMarker488"></a>
 deadlines, but sparingly</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There are times when you realize you&apos;re going to miss your deadline unless everyone chips in and works extra hard. You can motivate your team to rise up to the challenge, but you need to do it sparingly or you&apos;ll create resentment and burnout that outweighs the benefits. Expect your team to need time to recuperate afterwards: you&apos;re borrowing energy from the future and you&apos;ll need to repay it.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor614"></a>
 Get clear on the reasons it&apos;s worth it to work harder now</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Your teammates will be angry if they think you&apos;re just trying to make yourself look good, but they might be convinced by how much the launch will help customers, how much revenue will be lost during a delay, following through on their commitments, or meeting an external constraint (like a conference date).</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you can, connect those reasons to the bigger picture. Are there financial plans, fundraising milestones, or competitive pressure that make the urgency real? The more compelling the reasons are, the more likely it is that your team will decide they want to put in the effort.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You should also double check that it actually makes sense to push harder. Does the launch date really matter? Could you cut scope instead? It might be better to just reflect on what went wrong and fix it for next time.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor615"></a>
 Ask in the right way</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The way you make the request can influence the outcome.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Be honest about the problem. If it&apos;s partially your fault that the team fell behind, acknowledge that. You can frame the problem as new information so it doesn&apos;t sound like you&apos;re blaming anyone. For example, &quot;We learned the authentication system had more complexities than expected.&quot; Share what you&apos;re doing to make sure it doesn&apos;t happen again.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Treat your teammates as partners in problem solving and try to come up with solutions collaboratively. Reinforce that the launch belongs to the team and is everyone&apos;s responsibility. For example you might say, &quot;I&apos;ve been looking for ways to make the launch successful and so far it looks like coming in on the weekend is the best solution. Does anyone have other ideas?&quot;</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor616"></a>
 Look for ways to make the extra work fun</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Many people find that their fondest memories of a team are the times they all had to work extra hard together. Done well, it can turn into a bonding experience.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here are some ideas to make late nights or weekends more fun:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Order food to eat together—dinner, or just some fun treats</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Create a friendly competition</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Give out something memorable like a t-shirt or stickers</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Play music (if the engineers on your team like that)</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Head out to something fun afterwards</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Match people to the things they&apos;re interested in</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I would encourage you to work alongside your team, even if PM work isn&apos;t a blocker for the launch. When you ask engineers to stay late, but you&apos;re not making the same sacrifice, it often leads to resentment.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor617" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Concepts and Frameworks</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor618"></a>
 Intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Consider this scenario:</p>
<p class="BODY_Sidebar-Heading" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor619" style=";color:black;"></a>
 A story of two favors</p>
<p class="BODY_Sidebar" style=";color:black;">Your friend Shana comes to you asking a favor. Could you spare a few hours this weekend to help her move? She knows it&apos;s an inconvenience, and so she&apos;ll pay you $20.</p>
<p class="BODY_Sidebar" style=";color:black;">You do the math in your head. $20 for several hours of work? &quot;No, thanks,&quot; you say.</p>
<p class="BODY_Sidebar" style=";color:black;">She expresses her surprise. You helped Kari last month—and Kari didn&apos;t even pay you!</p>
<p class="BODY_Sidebar" style=";color:black;">&quot;Fine,&quot; Shana replies. &quot;How about I don&apos;t pay you? Is that better?&quot;</p>
<p class="BODY_Sidebar" style=";color:black;">No, it&apos;s not better. What went wrong?</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The problem here is <span class="CharOverride-1">motivation</span>
 . There are two types of motivation, and they are not equally effective. <span class="CharOverride-2">Extrinsic motivation</span>
 is when someone is motivated by external factors like <a id="_idIndexMarker489"></a>
 rewards or punishments. <span class="CharOverride-2">Intrinsic motivation</span>
 is when someone is motivated to perform an activity because it&apos;s personally rewarding, such as because they find it fun, feel connected to the purpose, or enjoy the challenge.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Intrinsic motivation is more effective than extrinsic motivation for any work requiring creativity. People who are internally driven to do their work will be more persistent, resilient, and creative. Extrinsic motivation is only recommended for non-creative work where people don&apos;t start with much intrinsic motivation, such as sourcing and batch-emailing candidates—but, even there, you have to make sure that the extrinsic motivation is sufficient.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A surprising finding from behavioral economists is that external motivators (like rewards and punishments) can easily replace internal motivation with external motivation. Worse, the internal motivation doesn&apos;t return when the rewards stop.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This was precisely the issue with Shana. Her extrinsic motivator pushed out your intrinsic motivation to be helpful, and wasn&apos;t sufficient for the task either. Whoops.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In his book <span class="CharOverride-1">Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us</span>
 , Daniel H. Pink shares a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">When children were told they&apos;d get a reward for drawing, they chose to draw less in their free time than students who weren&apos;t told they&apos;d be rewarded; the reward had turned play into work.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">When parents were charged a fee for picking their child up late from daycare, late pickups increased; they lost the internal motivation of guilt.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">When likely donors were offered a small payment to donate blood, they were much less likely to donate; it tainted an altruistic act.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As a leader, you need to be careful about accidentally demotivating your teammates with external motivations. A reward for fixing bugs, a promised bonus for shipping, or even excessive conversations about compensation can all reduce people&apos;s intrinsic motivation.</p>
<p class="BODY_Emphasis">There&apos;s a workaround. Surprise <a id="_idIndexMarker490"></a>
 rewards that people don&apos;t expect beforehand don&apos;t seem to hurt intrinsic motivation. The time-honored PM trick of surprising the team with donuts is still a great way to motivate people.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In Pink&apos;s research, he found that there are three things that increase intrinsic motivation: <a id="_idIndexMarker491"></a>
 autonomy, mastery, and <a id="_idIndexMarker492"></a>
 purpose.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor620"></a>
 Autonomy</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When people have self-direction rather than being micromanaged, they naturally feel more motivation. When it feels like someone else is steering the ship, it&apos;s hard to feel pride of ownership and motivation.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here are some ways to foster autonomy:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Tell people what to do (the results you want), but not how to do it.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Treat people like you&apos;re all equal teammates. Stay late if other teammates need to stay late. Ask how you can help rather than blaming people for making mistakes.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Include all team members in setting goals, creating a strategy, and planning.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Run hackathons where people can work on whatever they want.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor621"></a>
 Mastery</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">People thrive on a sense of progress. They love to see that they are getting better, developing skills, learning, and tackling bigger problems.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">To foster mastery:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Text-Left ParaOverride-1">Set goals as a team and review progress together.</li>
<li class="Text-Left ParaOverride-1">Hold retrospectives and talk about what you want to do better next time.</li>
<li class="Text-Left ParaOverride-1">Let people work on projects where they&apos;re excited about the intellectual challenge.</li>
<li class="Text-Left ParaOverride-1">Recognize people&apos;s skills and offer them new opportunities to use them—for example, encouraging people-oriented teammates to plan team offsites.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor622"></a>
 <a id="_idIndexMarker493"></a>
 Purpose</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Purpose is the sense that the work is in the service of something larger than oneself. People are driven to accomplish something meaningful.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">To reinforce a sense of purpose:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Create a vision for your team. See <a href="text00024.html#_idTextAnchor440">Chapter 15: Vision</a>
</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Take every opportunity to remind people of how their work connects to the larger purpose. Expect people to forget the vision and strategy, and need reminding. Repeat, repeat, repeat.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Let your own enthusiasm for the work shine through.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Bring your engineers and designers along to meet customers in person.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">One important type of purpose that drives some people is the affiliation motivation: being motivated by a sense of belonging. People who are motivated by affiliation want warm interpersonal relationships and strong bonds. They work hard because they want to support their team.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">To support an affiliation motivation:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Provide opportunities for team bonding like offsites or dinners.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Celebrate milestones, such as launches, with a work party.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Create team rituals like dressing up in a certain color on Fridays, keeping snacks at the newest teammate&apos;s desk, or ending meetings with a team cheer.<span class="EndNote _idGenCharOverride-2">

<a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00034.html#endnote-001">1</a>
</span>
</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Remember: Happy teammates are productive teammates.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor623" style=";color:black;"></a>
