<p class="First-Paragraph---Main-Book">
<span class="AllCaps-Bold _idGenCharOverride-1">Finally, we get</span>
 to the part about product <a id="_idIndexMarker201"></a>
 documentation! The one deliverable PMs are actually responsible for.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Careful, though.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">PMs tend to expect too much from the document itself, and not enough from the thinking and collaboration that goes into writing it.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Whether you use a product specification (spec), <a id="_idIndexMarker202"></a>
 Product Requirements Doc (PRD), <a id="_idIndexMarker203"></a>
 lean product canvas, or <a id="_idIndexMarker204"></a>
 product brief—all of which serve the same purpose—it&apos;s not a magic document. It&apos;s just a tool used to think through the important details, share your thoughts, solicit feedback, and improve the plan. And, like any tool, it can be misused.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This is why it&apos;s important to focus on the process and evolution, not just the final result. All of the product work you do throughout the product life cycle gets pulled together in the documentation. Transferring those ideas into writing gives you a chance to catch missing pieces and differing assumptions before they cause problems. Writing product documentation isn&apos;t about handing your perfect plan over to the team—it&apos;s about making the plan better!</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor245" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Use the Documentation Process to Clarify Your Thinking</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Don&apos;t think of the <a id="_idIndexMarker205"></a>
 spec as something that&apos;s just for other people. Use the writing process to organize your thoughts, plan ahead, anticipate risks, and to clarify your thinking overall.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Spec templates can be especially helpful by reminding you of all the areas to think about. If you are using templates, however, be sure to remove irrelevant sections and boilerplates, or it will make your spec hard to read. Additionally, if you&apos;re writing the spec template, be very careful about the length and effort it takes to fill out. If the template becomes overwhelming, people will stop using it altogether.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor246" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Optimize For Making the Document Easy to Read and Understand</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The most important thing about a spec is that it gets read and understood. This, however, can actually be a significant challenge. In actuality, most people don&apos;t want to read specs.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here are some tips:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Use diagrams and pictures to illustrate concepts.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Use bullet points so important information doesn&apos;t get skimmed over in a paragraph.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Keep it short—move as much as possible to an appendix.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Include information about alternatives considered and your reasoning.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Highlight the controversial bits / the places you need the most feedback and alignment.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Check in with your key partners for feedback on your spec format and if there are any changes they&apos;d like.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If none of these approaches work, you might choose to meet with your teammates to discuss the important pieces, rather than assuming they read the document.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor247" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Use the Spec as the Focal Point for Feedback</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Before the spec is finalized, you want to get feedback from all important stakeholders. If they have a problem with anything, you want to hear it now.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Ideally, you&apos;ll first share the spec with your closest partners, like your designer and engineer. If you&apos;re still at an early stage in your career, you might want to share it with your mentor or manager even earlier. Once your core partners have given their input, it makes sense to open up broader.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Depending on your company and personal preferences, you might want people to give feedback <a id="_idIndexMarker206"></a>
 asynchronously in the document, or you might want them to ask questions in a meeting.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If you have a choice, asynchronously is nice because it lets you gather all the feedback before you start responding. You might find that two pieces of feedback conflict, or that there&apos;s one controversial area that needs further discussion. When you can read the feedback on your own time, it lets you better prepare for the next steps.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor248" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Be Clear When the Spec Stops Being the Source of Truth</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">For a while, the spec will be the source of truth. During that time, when any changes are made, the spec should automatically be updated accordingly.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">At some point, it makes sense for &quot;the source of truth&quot; to move somewhere else, such as the designer&apos;s mocks, tickets filed, or the working code. When this happens, be sure to clearly mark that your spec is no longer being updated, and verify that all relevant parties are aware of the change.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It takes a moderate amount of effort to keep a clear source of truth. Often, there will be many places that link to the old spec—or one spec might be split into several smaller specs. It&apos;s a bit of work, but well worth the effort to avoid the frustrating situation of someone accidentally following outdated instructions.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor249" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Focus on Outcomes</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Product documentation is one of the few deliverables that PMs are actually responsible for, but don&apos;t get fooled: delivering a spec is not your job. PMs sometimes spend too much time making their specs perfect since these are one of the only things that are entirely within their control. Make sure you&apos;re <span class="CharOverride-1">outcome</span>
 -focused rather than being <span class="CharOverride-1">output</span>
 -focused. For example, ask, &quot;Did we identify and address risks well? Was everyone aligned on the plan? Was the launch successful?&quot;</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-1" style=";color:black;"><a id="_idTextAnchor250" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <a id="_idIndexMarker207" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Example Spec</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A book is a product, and this book happens to be one that our readers are, by definition, familiar with. So, let&apos;s consider what a spec for this book might look like.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Following a template like the one below can help surface important details and ensure you&apos;re solving real problems that people actually care about.</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Note the frequent use of headers and bullet points that make it easy to skim through. The &quot;<a id="_idIndexMarker208"></a>
 Use Cases&quot; section lists the important scenarios or uses the product should enable. The &quot;Key Trade-Offs &amp; Decisions&quot; section highlights the places where the PM considered alternatives to help readers understand the reasoning.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor251"></a>
 Problems</p>
<ul>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Companies often build terrible products that could have been much better with improved PMing.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">PMs don&apos;t always know what it takes to PM well.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">The best PMs aren&apos;t always effective at managing their own career, so they don&apos;t always get to have as much influence as they should.</li>
<li class="Bullets-Left">Mentors aren&apos;t as effective as they could be because they spend so much of their mentoring time answering basic questions.</li>
</ul>

 Key Trade-Offs &amp; Decisions</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor259"></a>
 How to group PM Skills</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Every company groups these skills together differently. I decided to go with the organization that makes the most sense to me, and mitigate the risk by ensuring that the keywords people would look for show up in the table of contents. We&apos;ll look for feedback on this organization during the beta reads.</p>
<p class="Headings_Heading-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor260"></a>
 How to highlight information that&apos;s relevant for senior PMs and higher</p>
<p class="Basic-Paragraph">We wanted to make sure that the book is helpful for senior PMs, and considered pulling all of the tips for senior PMs into a separate chapter rather than interweaving them in each skill section. I think it will be helpful for more junior PMs to see which skills they have yet to develop, as well as encourage senior PMs to scan the early career skills for anything they find useful. We&apos;ll look for feedback on this during the beta reads.</p>

 Key Takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-2">
<span class="CharOverride-2">The journey is more important than the destination</span>
 : Product documentation is just a tool used to think through the important details, share key decisions, solicit feedback, and improve the plan. The final deliverable isn&apos;t as valuable as the process you go through to write the documentation.</li>
<li class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-2">
<span class="CharOverride-2">Don&apos;t replace judgment with templates</span>
 : Templates can help jog your memory about which areas to consider, but they&apos;re not a replacement for judgment. Don&apos;t get over-focused on picking the right template; instead, focus on understanding the purpose of each section of the template, and how it contributes to the desired outcome.</li>
