			<p class="author-quote">"The organizational tools, magnetic timeline, and third-party ecosystem have made Final Cut Pro X an integral part of my editing experience on everything from corporate video, to documentaries, to featu<span>re films."</span></p>&#13;
			<p class="author-quote-source">— Not to be outdone by Alan, Patrick Southern is also an Emmy award-winning editor and a Workflow Architect at Frame.io</p>&#13;
			<p>You've got your footage imported into a Library, you've added Keywords, you've made Favorites, and you're looking at the next step: starting to put the best bits together in a sequence. Here, you'll learn how to create a new Project in which you can start your edits, and all the technical settings you need to know. As well as adding clips with shortcuts, buttons, and drag and drop, you'll learn about basic timeline operations: rearranging, trimming, breaking up, and deleting. You'll also learn how to duplicate an entire timeline.</p>&#13;
			<p>While the steps here are easy to follow, it's possible to get frustrated if you try to fight the system and put clips far away from one another. The Magnetic Timeline has some powerful tricks, and if you're new to editing, it makes a ton of sense. That said, because of the way the Magnetic Timeline functions — closing gaps by default and using connections instead of tracks — some operations don't work exactly as experienced editors might expect them to. If that's you, don't worry! Just relax and go with the flow, rather than fighting the system. You'll still be able to get the job done, as we'll cover more advanced freeform techniques later in the book. This chapter covers the following topics:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Creating a n<span>ew Project</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Adding your media in a few diff<span>erent ways</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Rearranging <span>your clips</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Basic trimming with the Magneti<span>c Timeline</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Blading an<span>d deleting</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Duplicatin<span>g Projects</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>At the end of this chapter, you'll have a rough cut in place — an important step in the journey toward a finished edit. That rough cut spine will be just a row of clips in a single layer, and we'll expand it, adding clips above and below the spine, in future chapters.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-158"><a id="_idTextAnchor165"/>Creating a new Project</h1>&#13;
			<p>This<a id="_idIndexMarker363"/> is the part of the book where you finally get to play in a timeline, putting one clip after another and creating a story. It's important to get the technical details right, and there's plenty of that coming up soon, as well as some sneaky tricks for easy version control and weird custom Projects. But first, a terminology recap.</p>&#13;
			<p>As you'll recall, you make a <strong class="bold">Library</strong> for each separate job you take on. <strong class="bold">Libraries</strong> hold <strong class="bold">Events</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Events</strong> hold anything smaller: <strong class="bold">clips</strong> and/or <strong class="bold">Projects</strong>. We've mostly been dealing with clips so far: importing them, keywording, selecting, and rating parts as Favorites. To put those clips in the right order and make a movie, you need to make a Project, which you can think of as your timeline, edit, or sequence. Each Project will be trimmed, finessed, finished, and shared to a final deliverable file. </p>&#13;
			<p>Remember — the overall job is held in a <strong class="bold">Library</strong>, and each edit you deliver is called a <strong class="bold">Project</strong>. When you open up a Project, it's shown in the <strong class="bold">Timeline</strong> pane of the interface. When talking to clients, I tend to use the term "timeline" or "edit" to avoid confusion, because the term "Project" has other meanings outside of FCP X. </p>&#13;
			<p>Naming aside, creating a Project can be pretty simple:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li>Select the Event where you want to store a<span> Project. </span></li>&#13;
				<li>Go to <strong class="bold">File</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">New</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Pro</strong><span><strong class="bold">ject</strong></span><span> (</span><span><strong class="bold">⌘N</strong></span><span>).</span></li>&#13;
				<li>With the simple <strong class="bold">Automatic Settings</strong> shown, give the Project a name ending in <strong class="source-inline">v 1</strong> (the space is important, and you'll see why at the end of this<span> chapter):</span><div id="_idContainer179" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_6.1_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.1: If you see Use Custom Settings at the bottom left, you're looking at Automatic Settings"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.1: If you see Use Custom Settings at the bottom left, you're looking at Automati<span>c Settings</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Click <strong class="bold">OK</strong> to<a id="_idIndexMarker364"/> create your firs<span>t Project.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>Great — you'll see a timeline appear at the bottom of the screen, and you'll also see your new Project in your Browser with a new kind of icon at the top of the list:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer180" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.2_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.2: A new Project, ready for clips"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.2: A new Project, ready<span> for clips</span></p>&#13;
			<p>If you need to <a id="_idIndexMarker365"/>rename a Project, do the following:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Click once on<span> the name.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">return</strong>, then type the<span> new name.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>Double-clicking on a Project name will open that Project, so if you want to rename it, be sure to leave a pause between clicks.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-159"><a id="_idTextAnchor166"/>The perils of Automatic Settings</h2>&#13;
			<p>By default, <strong class="bold">Automatic Settings</strong> defines<a id="_idIndexMarker366"/> the frame rate and resolution of the Project by matching the first clip you add to the timeline. While you'll often want to shoot and export with the same settings, that's not always the case. <strong class="bold">Automatic Settings</strong> can get you into trouble if you've shot footage with a variety of frame rates, or if you need to deliver to a non-standard aspect ratio, such as a square (1:1) or vertical (9:16).</p>&#13;
			<p>For example, if you've shot most of the footage at 25p and plan to deliver that, you would also want to set your timeline to 25p. But if a client provides additional iPhone clips shot at 30p, and you add one of those clips to your timeline first, your timeline will be set to 30p. Another common trap is sprung if the first clip you add doesn't have a frame rate (such as a still image) or a resolution (such as a music track). Adding one of these clips first causes FCP X to ask you what settings you'd like for your Project, forcing you to pick your settings manually after all.</p>&#13;
			<p>Getting one of these settings wrong can be a huge issue, because a Project's frame rate cannot be changed unless it is empty; you can only copy its contents, then paste them into another Project and mess up all the edits. While a Project's resolution can be changed, if you change the aspect ratio, all your clips will be repositioned.</p>&#13;
			<p>To avoid all these problems, I'd <a id="_idIndexMarker367"/>recommend going a step further when creating a Project:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Go to <strong class="bold">File</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">New</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Project</strong> (<strong class="bold">⌘N</strong>) and give this Project a different name (still ending in <strong class="source-inline">v 1</strong>, a<span>s before).</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Click on <strong class="bold">Use Custom Settings</strong> in the bottom-left corner to see the full set o<span>f options:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer181" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.2_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.3: If you see Use Automatic Settings in the bottom left, you're looking at Custom Settings"/>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.3: If you see Use Automatic Settings in the bottom left, you're looking at Custo<span>m Settings</span></p>&#13;
			<p>These controls can be<a id="_idIndexMarker368"/> important, but what do they all mean? Read on.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-160"><a id="_idTextAnchor167"/>Custom Project settings</h2>&#13;
			<p><strong class="bold">Custom Settings</strong> lets you <a id="_idIndexMarker369"/>define exactly what resolution, frame rate, and rendering codec you want to use for this Project. You should know what you want to deliver, so getting the settings right should be simple. In most cases, you should do the following:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Under <strong class="bold">Video</strong>, choose <strong class="bold">4K</strong> or <strong class="bold">1080p HD</strong> from the first drop-<span>down menu:</span><div id="_idContainer182" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_6.4_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.4: Here, I've chosen 4K, but if you want to choose 1080p HD, that's fine"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.4: Here, I've chosen 4K, but if you want to choose 1080p HD, t<span>hat's fine</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Confirm that the first item in the second drop-down menu is selected. This will be <strong class="bold">3840x21</strong><span><strong class="bold">60</strong></span><span> for 4K:</span><div id="_idContainer183" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_6.5_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.5: In 4K, the first resolution (also known as UHD or 2160p) is most common"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.5: In 4K, the first resolution (also known as UHD or 2160p) is m<span>ost common</span></p><p>Or, this <a id="_idIndexMarker370"/>will be <strong class="bold">1920x1080</strong> for 1080p:</p><div id="_idContainer184" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_6.6_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.6: In 1080p, you'll almost always use the first resolution"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.6: In 1080p, you'll almost always use the first <span>resolution</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">24p</strong>, <strong class="bold">25p</strong>, <strong class="bold">30p</strong> or something else, depending on the req<span>uirements:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer185" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.7_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.7: Here, I've chosen 25p, although you may choose something entirely different"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.7: Here, I've chosen 25p, although you may choose something entirely<span> different</span></p>&#13;
			<p>You'll remember from <a href="B15343_02_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor044"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Before the Edit: Production Tips</em>, that the frame rate should probably match what you've shot. If you're delivering online, it won't matter much, so long as you're consistent, but your choice might be forced by your region and your equipment. In terms of resolution, I like to deliver 4K when I can, but if the spec says 1080p, that's fine.</p>&#13;
			<p><strong class="bold">Rendering</strong> and <strong class="bold">Audio</strong> are <a id="_idIndexMarker371"/>normally fine on their default settings: <strong class="bold">Apple ProRes 422</strong> and <strong class="bold">Stereo</strong> at <strong class="bold">48kHz</strong>. All the other <strong class="bold">Rendering</strong> options are higher quality than you'll likely need, and most delivery methods can't handle surround sound. Still, you can absolutely deliver a surround mix direct from FCP X if you want to, so experiment if you have the gear to play it back.</p>&#13;
			<p>A final note: if you've jumped ahead and created a Wide Gamut Library, then you'll see options for Wide Gamut Projects here too, but that's something for <a href="B15343_11_PreFinal_Apple_SK+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor296"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, <em class="italic">Play With Light: Color Correction an</em><em class="italic">d Grading</em>.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-161"><a id="_idTextAnchor168"/>Non-standard resolutions</h2>&#13;
			<p>If you want to <a id="_idIndexMarker372"/>deliver to a non-widescreen format, likely for social media, then you'll want to follow the specifications. Social media is unlikely to be fussy about frame rate (30fps or lower should be fine), but the aspect ratio is important. The <strong class="bold">Video</strong> menu here allows you to choose <strong class="bold">Vertical</strong>, <strong class="bold">Square</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Custom</strong>, and between them, you can do anything you like. <strong class="bold">Vertical</strong> and <strong class="bold">Square</strong> include common resolution presets for those aspect ratios, but if you need something else, choose a custom resolution, like this:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Under <strong class="bold">Video</strong>, choose <strong class="bold">Custom</strong> from the first drop-<span>down menu.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>In the two fields that appear below, type in the width and height that the specification<span>s ask for:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer186" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.8_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.8: With Custom, you can choose anything you want"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.8: With Custom, you can choose anythin<span>g you want</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Those numbers are one option for an <strong class="bold">Instagram In-Feed (4:5)</strong> video, which specifies 600x750 or 1200x1500.</p>&#13;
			<p>Essentially, you can<a id="_idIndexMarker373"/> make pretty much anything you need. I've delivered 2000x96 and 1536x144 videos for use on advertising boards at stadiums, and that's not the strangest thing you might be asked for. More importantly, if you need to deliver to multiple aspect ratios, such as widescreen and portrait versions of the same edit, you should account for this during the shoot by shooting wider than usual, then cropping to suit each delivery aspect ratio. </p>&#13;
			<p>You'll find out more about cropping in <a href="B15343_12_PreFinal_Apple_SK+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor331"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></a>, <em class="italic">Refine and Smooth: Video Properties and Effects</em>. You'll also find out more about duplicating your edit for multiple aspect ratio delivery in <a href="B15343_16_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor491"><em class="italic">Chapter 16</em></a>, <em class="italic">You're Done: Exporting Your Edit and Finishing Up</em>. Why so late in the process? Because it can make sense to have an edit in one aspect ratio entirely approved before converting it for other aspect ratios.</p>&#13;
			<p>Note also that there are higher resolutions (5K, 6K, and 8K) in the menu, in addition to <strong class="bold">Custom</strong>, as well as options for creating 360° equirectangular Projects. While 8K is just regular video at a much higher resolution, the 360° video options create a Project that behaves very differently to regular video. If you've shot 360° footage that you want to deliver as 360° footage, then this is the option for you.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-162"><a id="_idTextAnchor169"/>Moving between open Projects</h2>&#13;
			<p>If you followed all of <a id="_idIndexMarker374"/>those instructions, you'll have two Projects in your Browser, one with <strong class="bold">Automatic Settings</strong> and one with <strong class="bold">Custom Settings</strong>. They're both empty for now, but you can double-click on either one to open it, and you'll see the name of the current Project in the center of the interface, just above the timeline:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer187" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.9_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.9: The name of the current open Project is always shown just above the timeline in the middle"/>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.9: The name of the current open Project is always shown just above the timeline in <span>the middle</span></p>&#13;
			<p>To the left and right of the name are two arrows, though the right arrow might be grayed out. Those arrows let you jump to other Projects you're working on. You can do the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Click on the left or right arrow to move through recently opened<span> Projects.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Click and hold on either arrow to see a menu with a list of recently opened<span> Projects.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>With a <a id="_idIndexMarker375"/>Project open, let's get some footage in there! At the moment, it's probably empty and looks like this:</p>&#13;

			<p>That blank Project is about to get a lot busier, but before we fill it up, a quick recap.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-163"><a id="_idTextAnchor170"/>Review — creating a new Project</h2>&#13;
			<p>You've learned how to<a id="_idIndexMarker376"/> create a new Project, and why it's best to define a Project's properties explicitly. You've considered the resolution, frame rate, and aspect ratio, and you know how to move around between Projects. Lastly, if you're planning to eventually distribute your Project in a couple of different aspect ratios, that's totally fine. <a href="B15343_16_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor491"><em class="italic">Chapter 16</em></a>, <em class="italic">You're Done: Exporting Your Edit and Finishing Up</em>, has more information about that. For now, just focus on editing your primary deliverable. For that, you'll need to add some clips.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-164"><a id="_idTextAnchor171"/>Adding your media in a few different ways</h1>&#13;
			<p>From <a href="B15343_05_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor141"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Choose Your Favorites: Selecting, Rating, and Searching</em>, where you organized <a id="_idIndexMarker377"/>your media with <strong class="bold">Keywords</strong> and selected the best parts as <strong class="bold">Favorites</strong>, you're way ahead. Now, you'll finally learn how to add things to a timeline, creating the first stage of a rough cut. You'll learn how to add real clips (and placeholders with the keyboard and with the mouse).</p>&#13;
			<p>To summarize, you'll be selecting each clip you want to add, one at a time or as a group, and pressing <strong class="bold">E</strong> to append, <strong class="bold">W</strong> to insert or dragging and dropping. But the process is (of course!) more subtle than that, and you'll learn why you'd want to add clips in these ways, how to fake it if <a id="_idIndexMarker378"/>you don't have your media yet, and why keyboard shortcuts are often the way to go.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-165"><a id="_idTextAnchor172"/>Appending with a button or shortcut</h2>&#13;
			<p>On the left side of the <a id="_idIndexMarker379"/>central bar in the interface, you'll see the word <strong class="bold">Index</strong>, then four icons. They correspond to <strong class="bold">Connect</strong>, <strong class="bold">Insert</strong>, <strong class="bold">Append</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Overwrite</strong>:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer189" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.11_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.11: From left to right, we have Index, Connect, Insert, Append, Overwrite, and a small menu"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.11: From left to right, we have Index, Connect, Insert, Append, Overwrite, and a <span>small menu</span></p>&#13;
			<p>In <a href="B15343_07_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor202"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Cover It Up: Connections, Cutaways, and Storylines</em>, I'll show you <strong class="bold">Connect</strong> and <strong class="bold">Overwrite</strong>, including how to put clips <em class="italic">above</em> one another, but we'll keep it simple for the moment. Right now, the best option is simply to <strong class="bold">append</strong>, because it just adds the selected clip(s) to the end of the current timeline, no matter what the Playhead or Skimmer are doing.</p>&#13;
			<p>The slow and steady method is as follows:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Click on a clip to select the whole clip, or click and drag to select p<span>art of it:</span><div id="_idContainer190" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_6.12_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.12: Part of a clip selected in the Browser"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.12: Part of a clip selected in t<span>he Browser</span></p><p>If you decide to select just part of a clip, you'll see the duration of your selection on the tooltip attached to the cursor. You can easily trim this later, but remember to consider the duration of a shot in the context you plan to use it.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Move down to the <strong class="bold">Append</strong> button and<span> click it:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer191" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.13_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.13: The Append button, and the clip appended to the current Project"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.13: The Append button, and the clip appended to the curre<span>nt Project</span></p>&#13;
			<p>However, you'll<a id="_idIndexMarker380"/> find it much faster to do the following:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Click (or click and drag) on a clip to select the whole clip (or pa<span>rt of it).</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">E</strong>:</li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer192" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.14_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.14: Now there are two clips in the Project"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.14: Now there are two clips in t<span>he Project</span></p>&#13;
			<p>But that's not the best option. You can go even faster if you have no clips selected:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Hover over the clip you wa<span>nt to add.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">E</strong>.</li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>This last technique only works if you've already made a selection on a clip, or if you want to add the entire clip. It's therefore best used in combination with carefully chosen Favorite ranges.</p>&#13;
			<p>While it's easy to rearrange the clips afterward, try to add the clips in a sensible order. Hover over the first clip you want to add, press <strong class="bold">E</strong>, then the second press, <strong class="bold">E</strong>, and so on. Pretty quickly, you'll have the spine of the story in front of you. In different kinds of edits, that's going to look pretty different: perhaps it's a series of pieces to camera, which you'll cover up with B-roll later. Or perhaps it's a few moody introductory shots that you'll add music to, or a story of a character's journey. But there's not necessarily a right or wrong answer here; the goal is always to build the basics of a story. If people are speaking, it needs to sound good first, and we can cover up any issues to make it look good later — think in those terms.</p>&#13;
			<p>Lastly, try not to get hung up on<a id="_idIndexMarker381"/> the exact timeline position of clips just yet. If you know what clip you want to be first, and you know what you want last, you can add them both now, then rearrange clips later — but don't try to create a huge blank space before that last clip. It's possible to add gaps, to force a clip to go a long way down the timeline, but resist that temptation! Just go with this "gapless" layout for now, and add gaps later if you need them. </p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-166"><a id="_idTextAnchor173"/>Adding clips with drag and drop</h2>&#13;
			<p>Dragging and dropping is<a id="_idIndexMarker382"/> a natural way to work, and it does work<a id="_idIndexMarker383"/> pretty well:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Select a clip (or part of a clip) in th<span>e </span><span><strong class="bold">Browser</strong></span><span>:</span><div id="_idContainer193" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_6.15_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.15: If you hover over a selected area, the cursor changes to a hand to indicate it is draggable"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.15: If you hover over a selected area, the cursor changes to a hand to indicate it is<span> draggable</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Drag from a selected part of a clip from the <strong class="bold">Browser</strong> to the<span> </span><span><strong class="bold">Timeline</strong></span><span>:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer194" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.16_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.16: As you start dragging, a film icon appears"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.16: As you start dragging, a film ic<span>on appears</span></p>&#13;
			<p>What happens next depends on where you release the drag operation. If you release your mouse past the last clip in the <strong class="bold">Timeline</strong>, it's exactly like pressing <strong class="bold">E</strong>, just slower:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer195" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.17_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.17: Release the mouse after the last clip in the timeline, and it will be appended"/>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.17: Release the mouse after the last clip in the timeline, and it will b<span>e appended</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Look out! If you <a id="_idIndexMarker384"/>drag to a spot above an existing clip, you'll be connecting <a id="_idIndexMarker385"/>a clip above another one:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer196" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.18_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.18: Don't drag above or below other clips just yet"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.18: Don't drag above or below other clip<span>s just yet</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Don't do that yet, as it's going to be covered in <a href="B15343_07_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor202"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Cover It Up: Connections, Cutaways, and Storylines</em>. (If you've done it already, <strong class="bold">undo</strong> with <strong class="bold">⌘Z</strong>). Another operation to avoid for now is to drag directly on top of another clip until it shows a white highlight, like this:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer197" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.19_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.19: Don't do this yet either — it's a Replace operation, and we'll return to it later on"/>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.19: Don't do this yet either — it's a Replace operation, and we'll return to i<span>t later on</span></p>&#13;
			<p>But what if you end up dragging a Browser clip between two Timeline clips? That's just fine, and it's called an <strong class="bold">in</strong><strong class="bold">sert</strong> edit:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer198" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.20_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.20: So long as you can see the blue outline where the clip is going to land, it's an insert edit"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.20: So long as you can see the blue outline where the clip is going to land, it's an i<span>nsert edit</span></p>&#13;
			<p>No clips will be <a id="_idIndexMarker386"/>broken or destroyed if you use these simple<a id="_idIndexMarker387"/> operations, and if you get anything wrong, you can always just press <strong class="bold">⌘Z</strong> to undo, or <strong class="bold">⇧⌘Z</strong> to redo. Everything you do is saved automatically, and every change to a Project is undoable until you quit or close the Library. While these operations are always safe, and an easy way to experiment, if you insert with a button or shortcut, you could chop up the clips on your timeline.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-167"><a id="_idTextAnchor174"/>Inserting with a button or shortcut</h2>&#13;
			<p>The second of the four icons<a id="_idIndexMarker388"/> here is the <strong class="bold">Insert</strong> button, and as you'd expect, it inserts a video, much like dragging a clip between two others:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer199" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.21_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.21: As before, these are Connect, Insert, Append, and Overwrite"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.21: As before, these are Connect, Insert, Append, and<span> Overwrite</span></p>&#13;
			<p>When you press the <strong class="bold">Insert</strong> button, the selected clip is placed wherever the timeline Playhead has been positioned. If you've left the Playhead between two clips, then this is just like drag and drop. But if you've left the Playhead in the middle of a clip, then that clip will be broken up into two parts — even if one of those parts is just a few frames long — and the new clip placed between:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer200" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.22_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.22: Here, the wide P1140747 clip has been inserted in the middle of close-up P1140741, breaking it up"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.22: Here, the wide P1140747 clip has been inserted in the middle of close-up P1140741, brea<span>king it up</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Breaking up a clip with an <strong class="bold">Insert</strong> operation is sometimes what you want to do, but since it creates a discontinuity in the original clip, it's often not quite what you wanted. Note also that if you would prefer to use the Skimmer (rather than the Playhead), then you'll be unable to press the button, and will have to use the shortcut (<strong class="bold">W</strong>) instead. This is because the Skimmer will disappear as your cursor leaves the timeline pane to press the button.</p>&#13;
			<p>If you want to insert without <a id="_idIndexMarker389"/>drag and drop, and without breaking anything apart, then you'll want to master <strong class="bold">Snapping</strong>.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-168"><a id="_idTextAnchor175"/>How to use Snapping</h2>&#13;
			<p><strong class="bold">Snapping</strong> is a toggle, and when it's on, it forces the<a id="_idIndexMarker390"/> Skimmer and the Playhead to snap to the start or end of other clips, and to markers on clips. This will become more important in the next chapter (as it affects connected clips) but it's also important when inserting video.</p>&#13;
			<p> Glancing to the right of the main bar, you'll see these four icons:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer201" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.23_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.23: From left to right: Skimming on, Audio Skimming off, Solo off, and Snapping on"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.23: From left to right: Skimming on, Audio Skimming off, Solo off, and S<span>napping on</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The fourth icon indicates <strong class="bold">Snapping</strong>, which has the shortcut <strong class="bold">N</strong>. With <strong class="bold">N</strong>, <strong class="bold">Snapping</strong> can be toggled at any time, even in the middle of a drag or an edit operation when pressing the button is impossible. You'll toggle <strong class="bold">Snapping</strong> often: when dragging clips about, when making trim edits, and in many other contexts.</p>&#13;
			<p>Inserting is an occasion <a id="_idIndexMarker391"/>where we want <strong class="bold">Snapping</strong> on, to avoid the possibility of leaving a tiny "leftover" clip on one side of the newly inserted clip:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer202" class="figure">&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.24: The tiny clip just to the left of the new clip is the result of not usin<span>g Snapping</span></p>&#13;
			<p>To place the Playhead or Skimmer exactly between two clips, follow these steps:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">If the <strong class="bold">Snapping</strong> icon is white, press <strong class="bold">N</strong> to turn it <span>blue (on).</span></li>&#13;

			<p>You'll have noticed the <a id="_idIndexMarker392"/>yellow Playhead and Skimmer when snap points are reached, and that's the clear clue that a snap has been found. Let's take a closer look at the Skimmer and the Playhead in the context of the Timeline.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-169"><a id="_idTextAnchor176"/>Revisiting the Skimmer and the Playhead</h2>&#13;
			<p>In <a href="B15343_04_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor113"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Sort It Out: Reviewing and Keywording</em>, we looked at the behavior of these lines in the <strong class="bold">Browser</strong>, but in the <strong class="bold">Timeline</strong>, they're a little different. Point by point, in the <strong class="bold">Timeline</strong>, we have the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Playhead</strong> is a<a id="_idIndexMarker393"/> vertical line with an arrow at the top, is positioned with a click, and stays in position when the mouse cursor moves <span>elsewhere.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Skimmer</strong> is a<a id="_idIndexMarker394"/> vertical line with no arrow at the top, it moves with the mouse cursor, and is only visible when the cursor hovers ov<span>er a clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>If skimming is active, the <strong class="bold">Playhead</strong> is white, or yellow if the <strong class="bold">Skimmer</strong> is on top of the<span> Playhead.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>If skimming is not active, the <strong class="bold">Playhead</strong> is red, or yellow if <strong class="bold">Snapping</strong> is active and the Playhead is positioned on a s<span>nap point.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Skimmer</strong> is <a id="_idIndexMarker395"/>normally red, but if <strong class="bold">Snapping</strong> is active, it turns yellow when it's over a snap point or the<span> Playhead.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>As before, note the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Skimmer</strong> can be toggled on or off (blue means on) with this central toolbar button or the sh<span>ortcut, </span><span><strong class="bold">S</strong></span><span>:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer204" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.26_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.26: This blue icon indicates that Skimming is on"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.26: This blue icon indicates that Skim<span>ming is on</span></p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>If it's present, <em class="italic">the Skimmer takes priority</em> over the<span> Playhead.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>If those rules seem a little complex, simply remember: look for the yellow line if you want your edit to snap. Press <strong class="bold">N</strong> to toggle off an unwanted snap, or to toggle it on if it's not active. And definitely remember that <strong class="bold">N</strong> shortcut!</p>&#13;
			<p>Before you move on in the book, take a few moments to build up a story in your edit. If you've got holiday B-roll like the examples here, assemble the clips in an order that makes sense. If you're putting together a corporate message, you might start with a quick introduction, then the pieces to the camera (or other shots) that audibly tell the story. If you're following a script, pick a good take for each shot in the script. But what if you don't have all the shots you need? No problem.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-170"><a id="_idTextAnchor177"/>Adding temporary clips</h2>&#13;
			<p>This may seem obvious, but <a id="_idIndexMarker396"/>you can import still images just as easily as importing<a id="_idIndexMarker397"/> video files. JPEG, PNG, and PDF files all work well, and you can organize them just as easily. If stills won't cut it, perhaps you can fill some gaps with free or paid stock video sites: pexels.com is one site that has a selection of free video clips you can use even in commercial jobs. If you need some more clips to edit with, grab some now, import them, organize them, and append or insert them.</p>&#13;
			<p>FCP X also has a couple of built-in options to fill gaps, and one is literally called a <strong class="bold">Gap</strong> clip. To add a blank Gap to fill in space, do the following:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Click on or skim to the spot where you want to <span>add a Gap.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">⌥W</strong> to ins<span>ert a Gap:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer205" class="figure">&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.27: That lighter gray clip is <span>a Gap clip</span></p>&#13;
			<p>But if you'd like to start<a id="_idIndexMarker398"/> editing before you've shot a frame of video, you'll want<a id="_idIndexMarker399"/> to use Placeholder clips. Instead of a black screen, these insert an image with silhouettes of some number of people, in a changeable scene, at a certain focal length, with optional text. The process of adding and changing these Placeholders is as follows:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Click on or skim to the spot where you want to add a <strong class="bold">Pl</strong><span><strong class="bold">aceholder</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Insert a <strong class="bold">Placeholder</strong> with <strong class="bold">⌥⌘W</strong> (or use <strong class="bold">Edit &gt; Insert Generator &gt; Pla</strong><span><strong class="bold">ceholder</strong></span><span>):</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer206" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.28_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.28: This outdoor scene with a man and woman is the default look for a Placeholder clip"/>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.28: This outdoor scene with a man and woman is the default look for a Placeh<span>older clip</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Once you've added a <strong class="bold">Placeholder</strong>, you can do almost anything to it, and here's how:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">⌥-click</strong> on a <strong class="bold">Placeholder</strong> to select that clip and move the Playhead to that<span> position.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>If necessary, open the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> using the third window control in the top-right corner of the <span>interface:</span><div id="_idContainer207" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_6.29_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.29: To show the Inspector, make sure the third icon is blue"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.29: To show the Inspector, make sure the third ic<span>on is blue</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong>, click the <a id="_idIndexMarker400"/>first icon at the top left to switch to the <strong class="bold">Generator</strong> pane, then <a id="_idIndexMarker401"/>change any of the settings underneath, as s<span>hown here:</span><div id="_idContainer208" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_6.30_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.30: Just one possible setup for this Placeholder"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.30: Just one possible setup for this P<span>laceholder</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Text is optional, but to make it visible, check the <strong class="bold">View Notes</strong> box at the bottom, then switch to the <strong class="bold">Text</strong> icon, just to the right of the <strong class="bold">Generator</strong> icon at the top left of the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong>, and add t<span>ext there:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer209" class="figure">&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.31: Here's the result of those previo<span>us options</span></p>&#13;
			<p>You can use these <a id="_idIndexMarker402"/>Placeholders to build up an entire editing timeline before you <a id="_idIndexMarker403"/>start shooting, and then replace these clips with the techniques you'll learn in <a href="B15343_09_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor253"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Consider Your Options: Multicam, Replacing, and Auditions</em>.

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.32: The music video for Ky.'s song Gravitate started out<span> like this</span></p>&#13;
			<p>You'll see that I didn't bother changing the appearance of each of these Placeholder clips, but I did add extensive text descriptions to each shot, and positioned the edits in the right places to work with the song. I'll show you how to add music like this soon, but for now, just work with the audio in each clip. </p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-171"><a id="_idTextAnchor178"/>Review — adding your media in a few different ways</h2>&#13;
			<p>By now, you should have<a id="_idIndexMarker404"/> appended a number of clips, inserted a few more, discovered <strong class="bold">Snapping</strong>, and added a Placeholder or two. Your timeline should be looking a bit busier; so, let's mix up those clips.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-172"><a id="_idTextAnchor179"/>Rearranging your clips</h1>&#13;
			<p>This basic <a id="_idIndexMarker405"/>part of the edit — putting things in the right order — is very important, yet deceptively simple. FCP X makes it hard to get this wrong, because it's hard to break up a clip by accident, and the Magnetic Timeline means that you won't leave any gaps unless you add them on purpose. </p>&#13;
			<p>If you're new to editing, this probably doesn't seem too strange. You're putting clips in order to tell a story, so why would you want to leave gaps in that story? It's probably a little jarring for new editors to realize that simply rearranging clips is actually not a simple operation in most other <strong class="bold">non-linear editing systems</strong> (<strong class="bold">NLEs</strong>). One of the key innovations of Final Cut Pro X was <a id="_idIndexMarker406"/>to make it easier for you to experiment with your edit, letting you rearrange your clips without worrying about breaking anything. If you're an experienced editor used to juggling clips up and down to avoid clip collisions across multiple tracks, you can simply relax. It's easier here.</p>&#13;
			<p>Rearranging media is useful in all kinds of edits, so it doesn't matter if you're cutting a drama, corporate video, advertising, or a piece for an influencer on social media — flexibility is always useful. In this section, you'll learn all about moving, selecting multiple clips, and a few playback shortcuts too.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-173"><a id="_idTextAnchor180"/>Moving clips in the Magnetic Timeline</h2>&#13;
			<p>Moving <a id="_idIndexMarker407"/>and reordering<a id="_idIndexMarker408"/> a single clip couldn't be easier:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Click on the main part of a clip (its filmstrip is ideal) and drag it left<span> or right:</span><div id="_idContainer211" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_6.33_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.33: Four clips in a row — A, B, C, and A — and C has just been clicked on"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.33: Four clips in a row — A, B, C, and A — and C has just been <span>clicked on</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>When you see the clips rearranged to indicate their new position, release the mou<span>se button:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer212" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.34_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.34: The blue outline behind the dragged clip indicates where it will land after release"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.34: The blue outline behind the dragged clip indicates where it will land aft<span>er release</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The tooltip shows how far in time the clip has been moved, and when you release the mouse, the clip will simply land in the new position. Feel free to experiment, as you can't really break anything.</p>&#13;
			<p>The only way this can <a id="_idIndexMarker409"/>go wrong is if you drag too far up or down, moving <a id="_idIndexMarker410"/>the dragged clip outside the primary storyline and creating a connected clip. If you do this by accident, just press <strong class="bold">⌘Z</strong> to undo, and we'll revisit connected clips in the next chapter.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-174"><a id="_idTextAnchor181"/>Selecting multiple clips</h2>&#13;
			<p>If you want to <a id="_idIndexMarker411"/>move more than one clip, that's easy too — simply select more than one clip before you drag them. You can select multiple clips in a few ways:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Starting in empty space, drag a box around multi<span>ple clips:</span></li>&#13;

			<p>It's entirely <a id="_idIndexMarker412"/>possible to pick up and rearrange multiple clips from anywhere in the timeline in a single operation. Gaps between clips will not be maintained after dropping the clips, though the order will.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-175"><a id="_idTextAnchor182"/>Duplicating clips</h2>&#13;
			<p>While copy (<strong class="bold">⌘C</strong>) and <a id="_idIndexMarker413"/>paste (<strong class="bold">⌘V</strong>) do work, it's often much easier to <strong class="bold">⌥-drag</strong> to duplicate one or more clips. The process to duplicate a single clip is, again, very simple:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Hold <strong class="bold">⌥</strong>, then click on the main part of a clip and drag it left<span> or right.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>When you see the clips rearrange to indicate their new position<span>, release:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer216" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.38_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.38: The arrow with the green plus circle indicates duplication"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.38: The arrow with the green plus circle indicates d<span>uplication</span></p>&#13;
			<p>While <strong class="bold">⌥</strong> is held, the cursor indicates that a duplicate clip will be created. Any time you want another copy of any kind of clip, just <strong class="bold">⌥-drag</strong>. (This also works to create copies of files in the Finder.) And yes, you can select multiple clips before <strong class="bold">⌥-dragging</strong> to create duplicates of all those clips if you wish.</p>&#13;
			<p>Why not just use good old cut, copy, and paste? Well, with these simple edits, they'd work just fine, but as you build more complex timelines, with clips connected to other clips, pasting can <a id="_idIndexMarker414"/>become a little more complicated, as you'll discover in the next chapter. However, if you want to copy between two separate timelines, drag and drop isn't possible; so, copy from one Project, switch to another, then paste.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-176"><a id="_idTextAnchor183"/>Basic timeline shortcuts</h2>&#13;
			<p>As you rearrange and <a id="_idIndexMarker415"/>duplicate your clips, you'll want to review them in context in the <strong class="bold">Timeline</strong>. The playback shortcuts that work in the <strong class="bold">Browser</strong> work well here too, but a few keys have changed. The original shortcuts you'll still want to use are as follows:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Hover in the timeline, then press <strong class="bold">Space</strong> for p<span>lay/pause.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">J</strong>, <strong class="bold">K</strong>, and <strong class="bold">L</strong> for forward and backward playback at h<span>igh speed.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">←</strong> and <strong class="bold">→</strong> to move by <span>one frame.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">⇧←</strong> and <strong class="bold">⇧→</strong> to move by <span>10 frames.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">⇧/</strong> (or <strong class="bold">?</strong>) to play around the curr<span>ent point.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Some changed or new shortcuts that move between edit points are as follows:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">↓</strong> or <strong class="bold">apostrophe (')</strong> jumps to the first frame of the <span>next clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">↑</strong> or <strong class="bold">semicolon (;)</strong> jumps to the first frame of the prev<span>ious clip.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>These last two shortcuts work well to let you jump around the timeline quickly, and when used with <strong class="bold">?</strong>, let you review any edit quickly.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-177"><a id="_idTextAnchor184"/>Review — rearranging your clips</h2>&#13;
			<p>You've learned how to<a id="_idIndexMarker416"/> select one or more clips, and how to rearrange them into the correct order. Duplicating by <strong class="bold">⌥-dragging</strong> is a vital operation in all kinds of creative applications, so be sure to use that too. The review shortcuts you learned when assessing media are just as useful here. But review only takes you so far — how do you make a clip longer or <a id="_idIndexMarker417"/>shorter? You trim it. </p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-178"><a id="_idTextAnchor185"/>Basic trimming with the Magnetic Timeline</h1>&#13;
			<p>Trimming, at a basic level, usually<a id="_idIndexMarker418"/> involves moving the edges of a clip to see <a id="_idIndexMarker419"/>more or less of it. As with many other operations in FCP X, trimming is one that starts out being very simple, but has powerful subtleties (slipping, sliding, and rolling — all to come later). For now, we'll focus on several useful ways to make a clip longer or shorter, with the mouse and with the keyboard. But first, a little check — do you have enough media?</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-179"><a id="_idTextAnchor186"/>Do you have enough media?</h2>&#13;
			<p>Each clip on a timeline represents a link to all or part of an actual clip that was recorded. Put simply, the start and end of each clip can be adjusted to the left or right, making a clip longer or shorter. But that's only true if there's enough media to allow the edit to proceed. If you've added entire clips to your timeline, you might be using the very first or very last frame of a real clip, and each one is a hard limit past which you can't extend a clip. You can't use a frame of a video that doesn't exist:</p>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">   </p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer217" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.39.2_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.39: When you drag to a clip's limit, the red out point in the Timeline and the film overlay in the Viewer indicate that there's no more media available"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.39: When you drag to a clip's limit, the red out point in the Timeline and the film overlay in the Viewer indicate that there's no more media<span> available</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The good news is that in a real-world edit, you probably won't run out of media very often. Normally, an experienced videographer will start recording at least a few seconds before the action happens, and record for a few seconds after the action ends. You'll end up using some part of the middle of a clip in most circumstances, and so you won't run out of media. These spare few seconds, known as "handles," give you editing flexibility — which is especially important with transitions — so make sure to record for a little longer than you think you need.</p>&#13;
			<p>For now, if you've skipped a few steps and thrown entire clips onto a timeline, you might want to throw the middles of a few clips on there instead, because we're about to trim clips in both directions. Once you've got a few parts of some clips on a timeline, grab your mouse and let's get started.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-180"><a id="_idTextAnchor187"/>Trimming with the mouse</h2>&#13;
			<p>When you hover <a id="_idIndexMarker420"/>over the start or end of a clip, you'll see that the cursor changes to an icon that represents the start or end of a clip, with arrows on either side to indicate movement, and a filmstrip beneath:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer218" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.40_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.40: Here's the trimming cursor, enlarged for detail"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.40: Here's the trimming cursor, enlarged <span>for detail</span></p>&#13;
			<p>That filmstrip points to the clip that's going to be adjusted, and also indicates that this is an operation that "ripples" — that is, it won't leave a gap. To many editors this is a Ripple trim or a Ripple edit, but here, we'll just call it a trim. To perform the edit, do the following:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Click and drag near the start or end of a clip on the<span> timeline:</span><div id="_idContainer219" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_6.41_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.41: Dragging the in point (left edge) of this clip to the right shows a positive timecode"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.41: Dragging the in point (left edge) of this clip to the right shows a positiv<span>e timecode</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Drag left or right to move that start or <span>end point:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer220" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.42_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.42: Dragging the out point (right edge) of this clip to the left shows a negative timecode"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.42: Dragging the out point (right edge) of this clip to the left shows a negativ<span>e timecode</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Regardless of whether you<a id="_idIndexMarker421"/> are making the clip longer or shorter, you can see what's happening in several different ways, all at once:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>First, you can look at the timeline, where the video thumbnail and audio waveform reflect what's visible an<span>d audible.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Second, you can watch the tooltip's display of the timecode and distance moved to see just how far an edit<span> has gone.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Lastly, you can watch the Viewer, where a two-up display shows you the out point and neighboring in point around the edit you're adjusting. As you're only adjusting a single edit point here, one of the two frames will change while the other st<span>ays still:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer221" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.43_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.43: In the Viewer, only the left side of this two-up display changed as the out point of the left clip was adjusted"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.43: In the Viewer, only the left side of this two-up display changed as the out point of the left clip wa<span>s adjusted</span></p>&#13;
			<p>This two-up display is a great way to judge if two shots belong together, and also where you'll match up continuous action across two shots. The two shots just shown of <em class="italic">Campo San Marco</em> are telling different parts of the same story, of a child being swarmed by Venetian pigeons, but if neighboring shots are too similar in content, viewers (and you) will notice. For <a id="_idIndexMarker422"/>example, take the following:</p>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption"> </p>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.44: These two shots are both OK on their own, but back to back, they look uncomfortab<span>ly similar</span></p>&#13;
			<p>When dragging edits, you may find that <strong class="bold">Snapping</strong> helps, but it can equally get in the way. If an edit point unhelpfully snaps to the Playhead (or anything else), just disable <strong class="bold">Snapping</strong> by pressing <strong class="bold">N</strong> during the operation. You'll also often want to focus on a single edit, to be able to drag it and see just what's going on; so (with the <strong class="bold">Timeline</strong> pane active), use <strong class="bold">⌘plus</strong> (actually, <strong class="bold">=</strong>) to zoom in. To see less, zoom out with <strong class="bold">⌘</strong><strong class="bold">minus</strong>, or type <strong class="bold">⇧Z</strong> to see the entire edit. <strong class="bold">⇧⌘plus</strong> and <strong class="bold">⇧⌘minus</strong> adjust the clip height, and all those shortcuts have visual equivalents in the <strong class="bold">Clip Appearance</strong> dropdown menu to the right of the gray bar. Finally, remember that using <strong class="bold">?</strong> is a great way to check your work (<strong class="bold">Play Around Edit</strong>) after trimming.</p>&#13;
			<p>Mouse-based editing makes sense visually and is easy to understand. However, if you want to edit really quickly, the keyboard is often the fastest choice.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-181"><a id="_idTextAnchor188"/>Trimming with the keyboard</h2>&#13;
			<p>Editing with the keyboard is <a id="_idIndexMarker423"/>effective, and if you're an experienced editor trying to nail those story beats, you'll like these:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Click near the start or end of a clip on the timeline to select the e<span>dit point.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Move that edit point one frame to the left with the <strong class="bold">comma</strong> key or one frame to the right with the <strong class="bold">period</strong> key. Use <strong class="bold">⇧comma</strong> or <strong class="bold">⇧period</strong> to move by <span>10 frames.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>As simple as that is, the major downside is that there is no two-up display when you move edit points with the keyboard. That's not always a problem, though. If you're trying to clean up an edit by trimming a few frames from a sequence of clips, you'll want to know a few more keys:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">↓</strong> or <strong class="bold">apostrophe (')</strong> jumps to the first frame of the <span>next clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">↑</strong> or <strong class="bold">semicolon (;)</strong> jumps to the first frame of the prev<span>ious clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">[</strong> selects the out point of the clip to the left of the<span> Playhead.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">]</strong> selects the in point of the clip to the right of the<span> Playhead.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Combine those keys with <strong class="bold">period</strong> and <strong class="bold">comma</strong> to move selected edits, and you can trim many clips in just a few seconds. As great as those keys are, they're not my favorite way to trim. Read on to find out what is.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-182"><a id="_idTextAnchor189"/>Trimming the top and tail of a clip</h2>&#13;
			<p>Edits need to be tight, and <a id="_idIndexMarker424"/>clips need to become shorter far more often than they need to be longer. With that in mind, the <strong class="bold">Trim Start</strong> and <strong class="bold">Trim End</strong> commands are a great way to make clips shorter, and they can be used while the video is paused, or while it's playing:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Press <strong class="bold">⌥[ </strong>to use <strong class="bold">Trim Start</strong>, moving the in point of the current clip to the current Playhead o<span>r Skimmer.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">⌥]</strong> to <strong class="bold">Trim End</strong>, moving the out point of the current clip to the current Playhead o<span>r Skimmer.</span><p class="callout-heading">Important note</p><p class="callout">If you don't like those keys, define your own with <strong class="bold">Final Cut Pro</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Command</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Customize</strong>, and remember that one-key shortcuts are easiest to hit. If you have an extended keyboard, consider defining new single-hand shortcuts for these operations, such as <strong class="bold">F5</strong> and <strong class="bold">F6</strong>. If you have a MacBook Pro, you can also use dedicated <strong class="bold">Touch Bar</strong> buttons for these operations. </p></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>I like to shorten B-roll collections by playing an edit through at normal speed, then pressing <strong class="bold">⌥[</strong> when a clip should start, and <strong class="bold">⌥]</strong> when a clip should end — but never stopping playback. To see a few edits in sequence, let's play back some video:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer223" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.45_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.45: The Playhead is nearly at the end of P1140678"/>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.45: The Playhead is nearly at the end o<span>f P1140678</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Then, Trim End is performed, which <a id="_idIndexMarker425"/>makes the first clip shorter:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer224" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.46_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.46: P1140678 now ends at the Playhead"/>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.46: P1140678 now ends at th<span>e Playhead</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The Playhead continues to move forward:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer225" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.47_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.47: The Playhead is now passing through P1140712"/>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.47: The Playhead is now passing throug<span>h P1140712</span></p>&#13;
			<p>It does so until the next Trim Start, which shortens the current clip:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer226" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.48_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.48: The first part of P1140712, before the Playhead, is now removed"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.48: The first part of P1140712, before the Playhead, is n<span>ow removed</span></p>&#13;
			<p>A few seconds later, Trim Start is<a id="_idIndexMarker426"/> pressed again to make the same clip even shorter:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer227" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.49_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.49: More of the start of the same clip (P1140712) is now removed"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.49: More of the start of the same clip (P1140712) is n<span>ow removed</span></p>&#13;
			<p>If that didn't click for you the first time, try it out for yourself, preferably without stopping playback, on a sequence of a few B-roll clips. If you like, you can also explore the combo command, <strong class="bold">Trim To Playhead</strong> (<strong class="bold">⌥\</strong>), which always trims the nearest edit point (either the start or end) to the Playhead. Trim Start and Trim End are a great way to make your edits tighter and make you a faster editor.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-183"><a id="_idTextAnchor190"/>Extending edits</h2>&#13;
			<p>Occasionally, you might <a id="_idIndexMarker427"/>want to make a clip longer, rather than shorter, and there is a way to do that using the keyboard and the mouse together:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Select an edit point <span>on a clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Skim over a point near that edit where you want the edit po<span>int to be.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">⇧X</strong> to perform an <strong class="bold">E</strong><strong class="bold">x</strong><span><strong class="bold">tend Edit</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>What did that do? Well, if you skimmed to a point inside the clip, it's just like using Trim Start or Trim End — it made the clip shorter. But if you skimmed to a point outside the clip, the clip will become longer; it's like you've grabbed that edit point and moved it. So why not just grab it with the mouse? Well, this<a id="_idIndexMarker428"/> operation can also be done entirely with the keyboard while the video plays, so if you prefer to edit by feel, it's a good way to work.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-184"><a id="_idTextAnchor191"/>Review — basic trimming with the Magnetic Timeline</h2>&#13;
			<p>OK. Now you can add clips, move clips, and make them longer or shorter in interesting ways: with the mouse, with the keyboard, by trimming the start and end, or by extending edits. But what if a clip is just wrong? Get rid of it!</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-185"><a id="_idTextAnchor192"/>Blading and deleting</h1>&#13;
			<p>Chopping things up and <a id="_idIndexMarker429"/>throwing away the bad parts is a perfectly OK way to work. A big part of an editor's job is<a id="_idIndexMarker430"/> to remove unnecessary media, and if you're feeling old school, you can cut things up just like you're playing with film. There are many ways to remove a clip, or part of a clip, and that's what this section covers. As you might expect, we'll start at the simple end of things.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-186"><a id="_idTextAnchor193"/>Deleting clips</h2>&#13;
			<p>This is pretty<a id="_idIndexMarker431"/> simple. First, you select the clip(s) you want to delete, and then you delete them. Simple enough:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Select a clip by clicking on it, or select multiple clips by dragging a selection by <strong class="bold">⇧-clicking</strong> or <strong class="bold">⌘</strong><span><strong class="bold">-clicking</strong></span><span>:</span><div id="_idContainer228" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_6.50_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.50: A few clips selected"/></div><p class="figure-caption">&#13;

			</ol>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">&#13;
Figure 6.51: Those clips have now been deleted, and the ga<span>ps removed</span></p>&#13;
			<p>But there's another way if you don't want these deleted clips to cause anything else to move:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Press <strong class="bold">⇧delete</strong> or <strong class="bold">f</strong><strong class="bold">orward delete</strong> (<strong class="bold">⌦</strong>, only on wider keyboards) to replace selected clips <a id="_idIndexMarker432"/>with <span>Gap clips:</span><div id="_idContainer230" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_6.52_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.52: ⇧delete leaves gaps, but doesn't move around anything else"/></div></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">&#13;
Figure 6.52: ⇧delete leaves gaps, but doesn't move around any<span>thing else</span></p>&#13;
			<p>While you probably won't need to worry about the movement of other clips at this early stage of an edit, it can be an important factor in a more complex timeline.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-187"><a id="_idTextAnchor194"/>Breaking up a clip</h2>&#13;
			<p>From time to time, you <a id="_idIndexMarker433"/>need to break up a clip into a few parts, rather than trimming either end. To do that, you'll need to switch tools. For everything we've done so far, we've used the standard <strong class="bold">Select</strong> tool, a regular arrow, because it's the default tool from the menu to the right of the editing buttons:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer231" class="figure">&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.53: The Select tool is chosen in the menu at<span> the right</span></p>&#13;
			<p>There are other tools available here, and while you can click and choose one with your mouse, it's best to simply tap the shortcut to choose the tool you need:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer232" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.54_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.54: For the Blade tool, press B"/>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.54: For the Blade too<span>l, press B</span></p>&#13;
			<p>If you tap a key, you'll switch to that<a id="_idIndexMarker434"/> tool. But if you hold a key, you'll only switch to that tool temporarily, for as long as you hold it down. Anyway, we'll take it easy for now:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Press <strong class="bold">B</strong> to switch to the <strong class="bold">B</strong><span><strong class="bold">lade</strong></span><span> tool.</span></li>&#13;

			<p>The new edit is indicated <a id="_idIndexMarker435"/>with a dashed line for now. It's called a <strong class="bold">through edit</strong> because the two frames around the edit are actually sequential. If you change your mind, through edits can be selected (with the <strong class="bold">Select</strong> tool) and deleted, healing the clip as if it was never bladed. Alternatively, select multiple clips and then choose <strong class="bold">Trim</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Join Clips</strong> to remove all through edits in the selection.</p>&#13;
			<p>On the other hand, if you move either point around a through edit, it will no longer appear dashed, as it's now just a regular edit, and no longer a through edit. (Instead, it'll probably create a jump cut when played back, and we will fix those in <a href="B15343_07_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor202"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Cover It Up: Connections, Cutaways, and St</em><em class="italic">orylines</em>.)</p>&#13;
			<p>There's another way to blade that gives the same result, but without switching tools. As the video plays back, you can press <strong class="bold">⌘</strong><strong class="bold">B</strong> to break up the current clip at the Playhead, and the strength of this approach is that you can blade a clip while it's playing. That's certainly handy from time to time, but <strong class="bold">Blade</strong> (either way) shouldn't be your first choice. If you want to make a clip shorter, Trim Start and Trim End are more efficient. If you want to delete part of a clip, it's not the best for that either. The (tedious) process would be as follows:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Press <strong class="bold">B</strong> for the <strong class="bold">B</strong><span><strong class="bold">lade</strong></span><span> tool.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Click to place the fi<span>rst split.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Click to place the sec<span>ond split.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">A</strong> for the <strong class="bold">Se</strong><span><strong class="bold">lect</strong></span><span> tool.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Click the new separate clip between the through edits to <span>select it.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Pre<span>ss </span><span><strong class="bold">Delete</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>That's slow, and you'll be <a id="_idIndexMarker436"/>glad to know that there's a much better way.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-188"><a id="_idTextAnchor195"/>Selecting part of a clip</h2>&#13;
			<p>So far, we've<a id="_idIndexMarker437"/> selected multiple clips, but not part of a clip or parts of multiple <a id="_idIndexMarker438"/>clips. As the <strong class="bold">Select</strong> tool prefers to keep clips whole, you'll need to switch to another tool for this. It's called <strong class="bold">Range Selection</strong>, and the shortcut is <strong class="bold">R</strong>:</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.56: The Range Selection tool i<span>n the menu</span></p>&#13;

			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Press <strong class="bold">R</strong> for the <strong class="bold">Range Selec</strong><span><strong class="bold">tion</strong></span><span> tool.</span></li>&#13;

			<p>This process <a id="_idIndexMarker439"/>makes selecting in the Timeline just like selecting in the Browser. Just like <a id="_idIndexMarker440"/>the Browser, you don't need to use the mouse at all. If you'd prefer to use the mouse, you don't even need to switch tools, and the process is even simpler:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Skim to the start of the edit an<span>d press </span><span><strong class="bold">I</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;

				<li>Press <strong class="bold">delete</strong> to remove the selected vi<span>deo range:</span></li>&#13;

			<p>That's right — the<a id="_idIndexMarker441"/> standard <strong class="bold">I</strong> and <strong class="bold">O</strong> shortcuts work in the timeline too, and they give <a id="_idIndexMarker442"/>you a great way to select part of a clip so that you can get rid of it. As you continue through the book, you'll see other uses for selecting ranges in the timeline (such as changing audio levels); but for now, just remember to use this method instead of the clunky old <strong class="bold">Blade</strong>, <strong class="bold">Blade</strong>, <strong class="bold">Select</strong>, <strong class="bold">Delete</strong> method. When you're done, press <strong class="bold">A</strong> to switch back to the regular <strong class="bold">Se</strong><strong class="bold">lect</strong> tool.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-189"><a id="_idTextAnchor196"/>Review — blading and deleting</h2>&#13;
			<p>This section covered a <a id="_idIndexMarker443"/>few important features. Deleting is straightforward, and you'll learn to know when you want<a id="_idIndexMarker444"/> to leave a gap and when you don't. Breaking up clips with the blade is a common operation for some editors and a rare one for others, but if you like it, use it. Selecting ranges is a core technique for many operations besides deleting, including audio volume changes and some editing operations, so don't ignore it.</p>&#13;
			<p>After all that experimentation, you'll have made a lot of changes. If you decide they don't make your edit better, you can always undo them, but that only works until you quit the app. Why not make multiple different versions of your timeline so that you can step back in time whenever you want? </p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-190"><a id="_idTextAnchor197"/>Duplicating Projects</h1>&#13;
			<p>Final Cut Pro saves all<a id="_idIndexMarker445"/> the time in the background: everything you do is saved automatically as you work. The one downside is that if you were to make a crazy, experimental change and then suffer a crash, you could lose some work. For safety, it's therefore best to duplicate a Project before you make significant changes, and certainly before you begin a new round of changes based on client feedback.</p>&#13;
			<p>These are the steps to duplicate a Project:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Click once in the <strong class="bold">Browser</strong> pane to give<span> it focus.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Right-click on your current project in the Browser, then choose <strong class="bold">Duplicate</strong>, or press <strong class="bold">⌘D</strong>. (Alternatively, in version 10.4.9 you can also use the small menu to the right of the project name in the central <span>gray bar.)</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Double-click this new <strong class="bold">Project</strong> to edit it, and check that its name is showing in the middle of the <span>interface.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>That last step is important: always immediately double-click on the new Project to make sure you're editing the newest version. If you forget, you'll continue to make changes to your old Project while the new one sits there unopened and unseen. Messy. </p>&#13;
			<p>One more thing. The names we chose for our Projects way back at the start of the chapter allow a nice trick. If a Project name ends with a space before a final number, a duplicate of that Project will automatically increase that final number by 1. For example, <strong class="source-inline">Venice Highlights v 1</strong> will become <strong class="source-inline">Venice Highlights v 2</strong> for the duplicate Project. If you don't use a space, this trick doesn't work, so make sure to add that space before the final <strong class="source-inline">1</strong>:</p>&#13;

				<div id="_idContainer239" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.61_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 6.61: Always leave a space before the final number, and always double-click after duplicating"/>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.61: Always leave a space before the final number, and always double-click after d<span>uplicating</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The small menu to the right of the Project name in the central gray bar also allows you to change the properties for the current Project, but if you want to change the properties (or the name) of a <em class="italic">duplicate</em> Project, you should right-click and choose <strong class="bold">Duplicate Project As</strong> instead. This brings up the <strong class="bold">Project Properties</strong> dialog as the new duplicate is being created, and is an ideal way to create alternative aspect ratio versions of a Project. There's more on that process in <a href="B15343_16_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor491"><em class="italic">Chapter 16</em></a>, <em class="italic">You're Done: Exporting Your Edit and Fin</em><em class="italic">ishing Up</em>.</p>&#13;
			<p>You might also notice <strong class="bold">Snapshot Project</strong> in the right-click menu, and you can use that instead if you wish. It produces a new duplicate with a timestamp in its name, leaving you to continue editing the original Project; but personally, I prefer the simpler <strong class="source-inline">v 2</strong> naming strategy. Also note <a id="_idIndexMarker446"/>that there are some important differences between <strong class="bold">Duplicate</strong> and <strong class="bold">Snapshot</strong> that will be covered later in this book:</p>&#13;

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-191"><a id="_idTextAnchor198"/>Review — duplicating Projects</h2>&#13;
			<p>This was a short section, but it's really important. Autosave is wonderful until you need to refer to an older version of your Project that you didn't keep. Duplicating is a great solution to this problem — you can keep working safely, but if you ever need your old Project, it's a double-click away. Just always make sure to check that you're working on the newest Project, because old Projects are sometimes opened unintentionally.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-192"><a id="_idTextAnchor199"/>Summary</h1>&#13;
			<p>That probably felt like a lot. You've created a new Project with custom settings, opened it up, duplicated it a couple of times, added a heap of clips with the mouse and the keyboard, trimmed clips with the mouse and the keyboard in countless ways, rearranged clips by dragging, bladed clips apart, and deleted parts of clips before finally making a duplicate Project. All these operations are going to be your &#13;
bread-and-butter tools going forward, and you'll use them on every single job.</p>&#13;
			<p>But we're not even halfway done yet. In the next chapter, you'll learn about the wonderful world of connected clips and cutaways. They'll let you disguise your edits, smooth over problems, and make your subjects sound better. Using cutaways effectively is one of the easiest ways to make your edits more professional, so if you're keen to learn more, turn the page.</p>&#13;
