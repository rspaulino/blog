			<p>This chapter, unlike the other chapters in this book, isn't directly about <strong class="bold">Final Cut Pro X</strong> (<strong class="bold">FCP X</strong>). Instead, it deals <a id="_idIndexMarker055"/>with many of the technical and camera-based details that you <em class="italic">should</em> know and the basics that you <em class="italic">must</em> know — codecs, shot types, data rates, and more. Technical details are important, regardless of whether you're shooting your own video or you're working with a separate operator, <em class="italic">because you'll know what t</em><em class="italic">o ask for</em>.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">If you've been in the industry for a while or you have no plans to ever shoot a video of your own, feel free to skim quickly over this chapter. This book is designed to be useful for a wide audience, and so this chapter is full of details that new editors and shooters need to know. Experienced editors will probably know most of these important details already, so if that's you, speed-read your way to <a href="B15343_03_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor084"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Bring It In: Importing Your Footage</em>.</p>&#13;
			<p>There's plenty of detail here, but this chapter is not a complete preproduction guide. The preproduction process has many stages, and before you open FCP X, you should at least have an idea of what you're trying to make. The more detailed your idea, the better you'll be able to execute it. However, as there isn't space to cover the non-technical details of writing a script, drawing a storyboard, managing a crew, and wrapping cables to avoid tripping over them, this chapter talks about the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Getting the sett<span>ings right</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Choosin<span>g a camera</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Shooting the r<span>ight shots</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Working with multiple cameras and audio<span> recorders</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Managing everyth<span>ing on set</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>The goal of this chapter is to provide a technical primer for shooters and for the editors who have to work with them. If you're not 100% confident with frame rates, resolutions, shutter speed, banding, types of cameras and accessories, what B-roll is, and what types of shots you'll need to produce a great edit, this chapter is for you.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-43"><a id="_idTextAnchor045"/>Getting the settings right</h1>&#13;
			<p>Resolution, codecs, white<a id="_idIndexMarker056"/> balance, and other image controls are critical to capturing not just a good-looking image, but one that can be easily edited and manipulated. Technical settings are key, regardless of what kind of camera you use, so even if you don't plan on shooting a video yourself, these are the tech specs you'll need to know.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-44"><a id="_idTextAnchor046"/>Resolution</h2>&#13;
			<p>Video is essentially a <a id="_idIndexMarker057"/>series of still images, and each frame has a horizontal and a vertical dimension in pixels. Common resolutions use abbreviations, including &#13;
the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Ultra HD</strong> (<strong class="bold">UHD</strong>, commonly<a id="_idIndexMarker058"/> referred to as 4K): 3<span>840 x 2160</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">1080p</strong>: 1<span>920 x 1080</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">720p</strong>: <span>1280 x 720</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>To visualize those numbers, here's a diagram:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer047" class="figure">&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.1: Several common resolutions you might shoot a<span>nd deliver</span></p>&#13;
			<p>While it's true that 3840 is a little less than 4000 (4K), there's not much in it. Some cinema purists use a size of 4096 x 2160, one of the official "DCI 4K" sizes, but it's intended for cinemas and leaves black bars at the top and bottom of a 16:9 display. For the purposes of this discussion, when I say 4K, I'm actually referring to UHD.</p>&#13;
			<p>What should you shoot, then? Today, I always shoot in UHD and recommend that you do the same. But will people notice the extra detail over 1080p? Some will. It's true that people sit at a fair <a id="_idIndexMarker059"/>distance from their TVs, and the limitations of our eyes mean that some of the detail in a 4K image at that distance can be lost. Most phone-based viewers won't see the extra detail either; small screens, slow networks, and limited resolutions all limit what you can deliver.</p>&#13;
			<p>Yet, even if most of your audience is using a phone, it's a mistake to only plan for that lowest common denominator. Computer users with high-resolution monitors — every iMac user and many others — sit close enough to their monitors to see the extra detail easily. Aim higher than the baseline and you'll make even the fussiest clients happy. This shouldn't slow you down, either. While some other editing applications struggle to edit 4K without stuttering, a relatively modern iMac running FCP X will do just fine.</p>&#13;
			<p>There's another big reason to shoot in 4K, though. I shoot 4K for jobs that I know I will be delivering to a client at 1080p, or even 720p. Why? Shooting in a format bigger than you need — called <strong class="bold">oversampling</strong> — lets you safely zoom in to show just a small part of the captured image<a id="_idIndexMarker060"/> in the final video. This means that final control over framing passes from the camera operator to the editor, giving you lots of extra options and making every shot more flexible.</p>&#13;
			<p>Still, if your camera <a id="_idIndexMarker061"/>doesn't shoot 4K well, shooting 1080p can be totally fine. If you plan to deliver 1080p, just don't zoom (much) during editing and you'll be OK. A general rule is to never go above 120%.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-45"><a id="_idTextAnchor047"/>Portrait or landscape?</h2>&#13;
			<p>If you only<a id="_idIndexMarker062"/> ever plan on delivering to a vertical<a id="_idIndexMarker063"/> orientation, then you can shoot that way too. But for 99% of jobs, you should shoot in landscape — especially on a phone. If your client will be shooting footage on their own phone, be sure to ask them to shoot in landscape because most people will shoot in portrait without thinking twice:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer048" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_2.2_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 2.2: Hold your phone like it's a TV!"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.2: Hold your phone like <span>it's a TV!</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Computers and TVs use landscape orientation, and if you shoot portrait, your work will only ever look good on a phone. But also remember that the frame you shoot may be re-cropped and repurposed. Many kinds of commercial work are delivered in multiple aspect ratios, so bear that in mind when you shoot.</p>&#13;
			<p>One good strategy is to use a "common top," where you frame a normal amount of space between your subject's head and the top of the frame. When you present that footage in different aspect ratios, simply put the top of the clip at the top of the frame and let the other <a id="_idIndexMarker064"/>edges of the frame change as<a id="_idIndexMarker065"/> they need to.</p>&#13;
			<p>In summary, then — take a few steps back to zoom out, frame with a regular gap above the head, shoot in landscape, and record in high resolution, and you can use that footage for any kind of delivery.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-46"><a id="_idTextAnchor048"/>Frame rate</h2>&#13;
			<p>If it is at all <a id="_idIndexMarker066"/>possible, shoot in the same frame rate that you <a id="_idIndexMarker067"/>want to deliver. For a "cinematic" look, you'll want to shoot at 24 or 25 <strong class="bold">frames per second</strong> (<strong class="bold">fps</strong>), although 29.97 fps is widely used too. Why these specific numbers?</p>&#13;
			<p>A video image is updated a certain number of times per second, and that number is different for TV signals in different parts of the world for historical reasons related to electricity. Here are some guidelines:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>In 110–120 V countries, such as the US, Canada, and elsewhere, 29.97 fp<span>s is used.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>In 240–250 V countries, such as most of Europe (including the UK), Australia, and New Zealand, 25 fp<span>s is used.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>In the international world of feature films and high-quality TV, 24 fps is the norm, although 23.98 fps is often used as it makes for easier conversion to US TV <span>standards.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Does it matter which one you use if you're delivering online? Not much. But if you're delivering to TV or cinema, then it definitely matters, and you'll need to examine the delivery requirements carefully.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">You might also have to deal with interlaced delivery (1080i) rather than progressive (1080p), but interlaced video today is only requested for TV broadcasts. Shoot and deliver in progressive formats, unless the client explicitly asks for interlaced delivery.</p>&#13;
			<p>It's also possible to record at moderately high frame rates, such as 50 or 60 fps, or even higher. While these frame rates do deliver smoother motion, most viewers find that videos shot in these modes look a little fake, unnatural, or cheap when played back at that speed, and so these higher frame rates are rarely seen outside of sports and gaming videos. Rather, these higher frame rates are more commonly used to give the option of slow <a id="_idIndexMarker068"/>motion, captured at a high speed, but played back at a slower speed:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer049" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_2.3_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 2.3: This splash (and, in fact, this whole shoot) was recorded at 50 fps to give slo-mo options"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.3: This splash (and, in fact, this whole shoot) was recorded at 50 fps to give slo-<span>mo options</span></p>&#13;
			<p>If you record at 60 fps, you can then slow it down on the timeline, showing every frame you shot for a speed of 42% on a 25 fps timeline or 50% on a 30 fps timeline. This is referred to as <strong class="bold">Automatic Speed</strong> in FCP X, and it's very handy. But this is just an option — footage shot at a moderately high frame rate doesn't have to be slowed down. It's entirely possible to use this footage in real time instead by skipping frames on playback. Many shooters use these moderately high frame rates for B-roll (explained soon) to give more options during editing.</p>&#13;
			<p>Be aware that as you increase the frame rate, especially to higher numbers, the camera has to work harder, and you may have to compromise resolution as a result. Check your camera because there's often a distinction between "regular" frame rates, up to 60 fps, and "high-speed" frame rates, which can go much higher at a lower resolution, lower quality, and/or without audio. Whatever frame rate you shoot at, you should be consistent. While it's <a id="_idIndexMarker069"/>quite easy to incorporate slow-motion footage shot at any speed, your regular footage should all use the same frame rate — probably 24, 25, or 30 fps. Mixing similar frame rates can cause visible stutters (due to skipped or duplicated frames) and it's something to avoid if at all possible.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-47"><a id="_idTextAnchor049"/>Shutter speed</h2>&#13;
			<p>A separate but<a id="_idIndexMarker070"/> related issue is shutter speed, how <a id="_idIndexMarker071"/>many times per second an image is captured, which is expressed as a fraction of a second, such as 1/50 or 1/200. As a rule of thumb, to give your footage a natural motion blur, you should try to double your frame rate to determine the "ideal" shutter speed denominator:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>1/48 or 1/50 <span>for 24 fps</span></li>&#13;
				<li>1/50 <span>for 25 fps</span></li>&#13;
				<li>1/60 <span>for 30 fps</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>If you shoot at a significantly faster shutter speed, such as 1/100 or 1/200, the natural motion blur of 1/50 or 1/60 will be lost, and anything in motion will look a little "choppy" as a result. Conversely, if you shoot at a significantly slower speed, such as 1/25 or 1/30, everything in motion will look a little blurry.</p>&#13;
			<p>It's important to note that this rule (known as the <strong class="bold">180° shutter rule</strong>) does not apply to higher frame rates simply because any objects in motion will barely move between frames — there's hardly any blur to be had! If there's very little movement in the shot, there's not much blur in that either.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-48"><a id="_idTextAnchor050"/>Banding</h3>&#13;
			<p>However, there's <a id="_idIndexMarker072"/>another<a id="_idIndexMarker073"/> reason why these frame rates are popular, and it goes beyond a natural-looking blur. If you shoot at frame rates that aren't an even multiple of your lighting source, you might record <strong class="bold">banding</strong>, which is lines that are continuously moving down your image. Why? The answer gets a little messy, but it's for a similar reason to frame rate. Here's an extreme example:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer050" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_2.4_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 2.4: This blank wall shows extreme banding when a 1/200 shutter speed is used"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.4: This blank wall shows extreme banding when a 1/200 shutter spe<span>ed is used</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Your electricity supply is based on alternating power, which cycles at 60 Hz in North and South America and western Japan, and 50 Hz in Europe, Australasia, and eastern Japan. Many light sources cycle at the lighting frequency found in your country, and if your shutter speed doesn't match the frequency of your lighting source, your camera won't capture the light evenly. Instead, it <a id="_idIndexMarker074"/>will catch a little more in one part of a frame than the rest, leaving a dark band that moves from frame to frame. Sometimes, these problems are subtle, but often they're not, and it's critical to get this right for &#13;
your camera.</p>&#13;
			<p>This issue has led many people to conclude that the frame rate must be 25 fps in Europe and 30 fps in North America, but the frame rate can in fact be different. It's the shutter speed that controls banding, and even in 50 Hz countries, if your main light source is from a projector or large TV refreshing at 60 Hz, you'll need to adjust your shutter speed to 1/60. (Note that some special lights and some computer monitors refresh at unusual frequencies, and some cameras have special modes to deal with this issue.)</p>&#13;
			<p>Extra care is needed for high frame rates above 60 Hz. Shooting at extreme frame rates requires a really high shutter speed, and therefore, you'll need to use a light source that doesn't refresh itself at these low rates. Some professional lights are suitable, but the great ball of light in<a id="_idIndexMarker075"/> the sky always works well. </p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-49"><a id="_idTextAnchor051"/>White balance</h2>&#13;
			<p>Before you shoot in a<a id="_idIndexMarker076"/> new location, it's important to set a custom white balance, ideally with a gray card positioned where your subject will be. Different light sources give different color to a scene, and if you don't get this right, your subjects will look "wrong" — too blue, green, orange, or yellow. This can be corrected to some degree in the edit, but it's not always the easiest task.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">Don't use auto white balance unless you have no choice! Auto white balance can drift in the middle of a shot and be very hard to correct, while an incorrect manual white balance will be consistently wrong and is more easily fixed.</p>&#13;
			<p>The time before a shoot can often be used to set and store a custom white balance, and fancier cameras can store multiple custom white balance settings, such as the <strong class="source-inline">1</strong>/<strong class="source-inline">2</strong>/<strong class="source-inline">3</strong>/<strong class="source-inline">4</strong> setting shown here:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer051" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_2.5_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 2.5: The Panasonic GH5 white balance menu"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.5: The Panasonic GH5 white ba<span>lance menu</span></p>&#13;
			<p>If your camera doesn't have custom white balance options, you'll at least be able to choose from a range of presets, including daylight, fluorescent light, tungsten, and more. Choosing one of <a id="_idIndexMarker077"/>these will at least give you a consistent place to work from.</p>&#13;
			<h2><a id="_idTextAnchor052"/></h2>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-50"><a id="_idTextAnchor053"/>Codecs</h2>&#13;
			<p>Almost all <a id="_idIndexMarker078"/>cameras record in a compressed format and some<a id="_idIndexMarker079"/> are more heavily compressed than others. While it might seem useful to be able to record files in a smaller space, the more you compress a video, the lower the quality will be. Finding that sweet spot between a video that takes up too much space and a video that falls apart can be tricky, and not all cameras give you many options here.</p>&#13;
			<p>Most compressed videos today use a compression<a id="_idIndexMarker080"/> method (codec) called <strong class="bold">H.264</strong>, although H.265 (also known as HEVC) is becoming more popular. Support for HEVC (at the time of writing) is less mature; only recent Macs with a T2 chip can decode HEVC easily. Higher-end cameras might offer other options, such as ProRes, ProRes RAW, and Blackmagic RAW. While all of these formats do increase the quality, they take up significantly more space.</p>&#13;
			<p>For example, a Panasonic GH5<a id="_idIndexMarker081"/> records at a data rate of 100 <strong class="bold">Megabits per Second</strong> (<strong class="bold">Mbps</strong>) at 4K at 24/25/30 fps, or 150 Mbps for 4K at 50/60 fps, alongside many other options. Here's what that looks like:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer052" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_2.6_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 2.6: So many options — delve into the menus of your camera &#13;&#10;and test the settings out"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.6: So many options — delve into the menus of yo<span>ur camera </span>&#13;
and test the se<span>ttings out</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The data rate for ProRes at the same resolutions and frame rates ranges from 470-589 Mbps, much, much higher than typical H.264 and HEVC codecs. These increased data rates require a much faster and larger recording device, typically an SSD rather than an SD card. You'll want to find a balance between quality and file size that suits your job's needs; read reviews, download files, and do the math to figure out how much space you'll need.</p>&#13;
			<p>Lastly, it's very important to know that not all cameras compress video in the same way. H.264 from one camera can be easy to deal with, while footage from another camera stutters on <a id="_idIndexMarker082"/>playback. If it is at all possible, download some original footage from a camera you're planning on using to make sure it works well in your workflow. Expect new codecs and workflow changes in the future — standards do shift over time.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-51"><a id="_idTextAnchor054"/>Containers</h2>&#13;
			<p>Video data is encoded<a id="_idIndexMarker083"/> using a particular codec and is then stored in a container, usually a file with a <strong class="source-inline">.mp4</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">.mov</strong> file extension. <em class="italic">A container is not a codec</em>, however; H.264 can be found inside many different types of containers, and a <strong class="source-inline">.mp4</strong> file might contain video data in one of many different codecs. Still, you'll probably be fine; just look at the extension at the end of the filename to see which kind(s) your camera makes.</p>&#13;
			<p>However, there are cameras out there that don't produce single contained video files at all. The AVCHD format, for example, spreads important data out on separate files across different subfolders, meaning you can't simply copy a file from an SD card and have a single video clip. Instead, the video data needs to be rewrapped inside a container format that FCP X can use by importing directly from the SD card. Other cameras do contain their clips in single files (yay!), but they restart their file numbering on every card (boo!), leaving you to manage multiple files with identical names.</p>&#13;
			<p>Where possible, I prefer to avoid AVCHD and other fussy container formats. A standalone video clip with a unique name using a standard codec is the gold standard, and plenty of cameras make files like this. If you're choosing the camera, don't bend over backward to support one that makes your life difficult.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-52"><a id="_idTextAnchor055"/>Review — getting all the settings right</h2>&#13;
			<p>Let's combine<a id="_idIndexMarker084"/> all of these settings:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Ideally, you'll be shooting in 4K to H.264 or HEVC in a <strong class="source-inline">.mp4</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">.mov</strong> container at a data rate of around 100 Mbps <span>or higher.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>You'll use a gray card to set the white balance for each location you<span> shoot in.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>If you're in Europe or Australasia, you'll probably mostly shoot at 25 fps with a 1/50 shut<span>ter speed.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>In North and South America and most of Asia, you'll probably mostly shoot at 24 fps or 30 fps with 1/50 or 1/60 shut<span>ter speed.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>You might choose to use a moderately high shutter speed (50 or 60 fps) for B-roll shots, to allow for 50% sl<span>ow motion.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>You'll change the shutter speed for high frame rates or if you se<span>e banding.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>That's it — you've set your camera up for files that FCP X will import easily and that will cut well together. Now, you just need to master aperture, ISO, color profiles, and everything else that your camera offers! As much as I'd like to discuss all of these variables, it's beyond the scope of the book, and I can only advise you to keep the ISO low to avoid noise, keep your subject correctly exposed, shoot with a low f-stop if you want blurry backgrounds, and if you want to keep things simple, use a color profile that's close to what you want to deliver. But what kind of camera will give you these controls? Read on!</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-53"><a id="_idTextAnchor056"/>Choosing a camera</h1>&#13;
			<p>Camera operators are<a id="_idIndexMarker085"/> utterly spoilt for choice these days. While there will never be a perfect camera for everyone, you will be able to find something that works for you that's also in your budget. This is an ever-changing field, and specific camera advice will be quickly outdated, so I'm focusing here on general advice only. Remember that the adage mostly holds true: you can choose any two from <strong class="bold">fast</strong>, <strong class="bold">cheap</strong>, and <strong class="bold">good</strong>.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-54"><a id="_idTextAnchor057"/>An iPhone (or any other mobile phone)</h2>&#13;
			<p>Yes, you can<a id="_idIndexMarker086"/> absolutely shoot videos on your iPhone, and<a id="_idIndexMarker087"/> according to most reviews, an iPhone does a better job of video than most Android phones do. An iPhone will also be easier to use with your Mac, and it even includes iMovie, so you can start an edit on your iPhone, then transition it to FCP X on your Mac. The dynamic range (from shadows to highlights in a single shot) is huge, so you can film in more places. Image stabilization means the image shouldn't be too shaky. And it's always in your pocket! So far, so good. You can also add accessories, such as this ioGrapher case, if you want to tripod-mount it and add a microphone:</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.7: There are many ways to mount a phone on a tripod; this is <span>a good one</span></p>&#13;
			<p>However, even though an iPhone can deliver 4K, it has several limitations. First, the built-in <strong class="bold">Camera</strong> app can only shoot at 24, 30, or 60 fps, but not the 25 fps you'd probably prefer in Europe or Australasia. A third-party app, such as Filmic Pro or ProCamera, can set this frame rate, along with many other controls, but you still won't have as many direct options as on a real camera.</p>&#13;
			<p>Also, you can't zoom far without losing quality, and the picture tends to be a bit noisy and soft, especially in low light. File management is less convenient too because everything's internal; you can't just swap out a memory card if you're running out of space or swap out a battery if it's running low. </p>&#13;
			<p>Lastly, shooting on a phone probably won't impress paying clients, as silly as that may seem. Perception is reality for a lot of people, and if you turn up to a paid gig with the same camera<a id="_idIndexMarker088"/> that your client owns, they could perceive <a id="_idIndexMarker089"/>you as an amateur. That isn't fair; phones today shoot better video than most cameras from a few years ago, but it's still what happens. This will, eventually, change. </p>&#13;
			<p>So, it's convenient, but it could struggle in difficult situations and it doesn't impress clients.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-55"><a id="_idTextAnchor058"/>A DSLR or mirrorless camera</h2>&#13;
			<p>This is the current <a id="_idIndexMarker090"/>sweet <a id="_idIndexMarker091"/>spot for most new videographers. Canon, Nikon, Sony, Panasonic, and Fujifilm are the five main companies making mid-range to high-end video-capable cameras with interchangeable lenses. Some cameras are better at autofocusing during video recording than others. Some offer a more pleasing color profile than others. Some have amazing sensor-based image stabilization. All of them should give you a better image than any phone out there, and the better ones will let you plug in external<a id="_idIndexMarker092"/> microphones and headphones, too. Here's my GH5 with a wireless <strong class="bold">lavalier</strong> (<strong class="bold">lapel</strong> or <strong class="bold">lav</strong>) microphone receiver attached, at a jaunty angle:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.8: A GH5 with an Olympus lens and a RØDE Wireless GO<span> lapel mic</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Overall, these cameras create files that are easy enough to work with. They can shoot 4K, many accessories are available, they are reliable, and they come in many price categories. Larger sensors and faster lenses (which let in more light) make it easier to throw the background <a id="_idIndexMarker093"/>out of focus, an effect that many <a id="_idIndexMarker094"/>people associate with "professional" shots. A blurred background (from a fast aperture, rather than faked) is one of the key image characteristics that lifts a "real camera" above the "everything-in-focus" look of a phone.</p>&#13;
			<p>Some of these cameras have limitations (especially in 4K) relating to their continuous recording time, whether they can capture the entire image area or just a cropped part of it, and the data rates that they allow you to use. Another common limitation relates to frame rates — my Panasonic GH5 can switch to a huge variety of frame rates, but my cheaper, older Panasonic G7 is region-locked, stuck at 25 fps, and limited to half an hour maximum recording length.</p>&#13;
			<p>Importantly, most of these cameras give you full control over shutter speed, aperture, and other image properties, plus there are more advanced controls on higher-end cameras. The ability to use manual controls is one of the key features of a professional camera and allows you to get the shot in difficult shooting conditions where a fully automatic <a id="_idIndexMarker095"/>camera <a id="_idIndexMarker096"/>would make a bad call. </p>&#13;
			<p>You'll find a number of opinions out there, and your needs may well be different from other people's. Read as many reviews as you can, and download some sample files and test them out in FCP X before committing to a particular system. If you start spending a lot of money on lenses, you could be stuck using that system for several years.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-56"><a id="_idTextAnchor059"/>A high-end camera</h2>&#13;
			<p>If you decide to <a id="_idIndexMarker097"/>seriously invest in a camera, you might look to a high-end Sony, Panasonic, or Canon, a Blackmagic camera, or perhaps even a RED or ARRI. These cameras produce a lovely image that's very flexible and easily adjusted, but they require <em class="italic">more care, more accessories, and more resources</em> in post-production. Because they're built for a set, these cameras can be heavy, chew through batteries, make huge video files, and be harder to learn and use. Most also don't include image stabilization, so you'll need additional support gear for stable moving shots.</p>&#13;
			<p>But what you can sometimes lose in ease of use, you get back in raw resolution, color detail, and dynamic range. Your camera will also look expensive on set and in the edit bay, and it is indeed expensive. It's a camera for a professional crew on a professional set and will certainly impress clients:</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.9: A photo of a RED RAVEN camera by Bruno Masseo via <span>Pexels.com</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Regarding formats, most<a id="_idIndexMarker098"/> can record to ProRes (which is easy to work with) or more exotic formats (which are harder to work with), so if you receive footage from one of these cameras, you might need additional software to view its files. If you decide that you really need the look that a high-end camera gives you, FCP X can handle it (8K and beyond), but know that this power comes with<a id="_idIndexMarker099"/> limitations.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-57"><a id="_idTextAnchor060"/>An action camera or drone</h2>&#13;
			<p>At a variety of<a id="_idIndexMarker100"/> price points, you'll find pocketable <a id="_idIndexMarker101"/>cameras that incorporate a gimbal (such as DJI Osmo Pocket), as well as blocky cameras that you can mount to a car, helmet, surfboard, or ski pole (such as GoPro and many others) and drones of all shapes and sizes. Typically, these cameras have several options for resolution and frame rate, but you can't change lenses and you might not even have a screen; everything's on auto:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer056" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_2.10_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 2.10: This DJI Spark drone is a cheap way to find out if flying cameras are for you"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.10: This DJI Spark drone is a cheap way to find out if flying cameras a<span>re for you</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The strength of these devices is in getting shots from crazy perspectives that you would otherwise have missed, which is valuable. However, they shouldn't be your primary camera, because fully automatic settings will inevitably fail eventually, focusing on the wrong thing, under- or over-exposing, or messing up the white balance. If you need manual controls, look elsewhere.</p>&#13;
			<p>Typically, the files you get from these cameras are fairly small; they look OK, but not great, and they'll probably have a wide-angle look. Drones have the same benefits and drawbacks, except that their lenses are not usually so wide, and (of course!) they can fly. If they're <a id="_idIndexMarker102"/>legal where you are, they're great for very<a id="_idIndexMarker103"/> specific purposes — perhaps for introductory shots flying over a building — but not so good for interviews.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-58"><a id="_idTextAnchor061"/>A 360° camera</h2>&#13;
			<p>These cameras <a id="_idIndexMarker104"/>typically use two lenses (and sometimes more) to record the entire scene around the camera. Here's an Insta360 ONE X, with the second lens just visible at the back:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer057" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_2.11_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 2.11: An Insta360 ONE X, seen from the side"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.11: An Insta360 ONE X, seen fro<span>m the side</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The images from the two cameras are stitched together to create an "equirectangular" video, showing the entire scene around them. While it's possible to deliver this 360° footage to a headset, allowing the viewer to look around freely, it's probably more common to use 360° footage in a regular video-editing project. In that workflow, the editor chooses where the camera will look, and you deliver it to a regular display.</p>&#13;
			<p>The great joy of 360° is that <em class="italic">you never miss the shot because you're facing the wrong way</em> — just spin it around in the timeline. However, there's some crossover here between the Action and the 360° categories; you can't easily control what's happening on the camera and<a id="_idIndexMarker105"/> you will usually end up in the shot yourself, certainly if you're holding the camera. I love mine, and while it's terrific for family holidays, it's unlikely to crack the mainstream any time soon.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-59"><a id="_idTextAnchor062"/>Audio equipment</h2>&#13;
			<p>This area is huge, and I'll keep it brief. Your camera will have a microphone built into it, but it won't be very <a id="_idIndexMarker106"/>good. The <em class="italic">best audio is recorded from as close to your subject as possible</em>, and you could capture that with a boom microphone pointed directly at them (if you have a person to hold it) or with a <strong class="bold">lapel</strong> microphone that they wear. You can record audio directly into a camera (which is easier, but with potential quality loss) or into an external recorder (which is slightly more work, but with potentially higher quality):</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer058" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_2.12_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 2.12: The Zoom H5 is a four-track recorder that accepts XLR and a minijack, with a built-in stereo mic"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.12: The Zoom H5 is a four-track recorder that accepts XLR and a minijack, with a built-in <span>stereo mic</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Professional gear has three huge advantages over cheap gear: <em class="italic">it sounds better, it has less noise, and it's more reliable</em>. But beware — more expensive gear will only get better sound if it's used correctly. If you're a one-person operator, you probably can't keep a boom mic pointed<a id="_idIndexMarker107"/> in exactly the right direction while operating a camera, so consider using a good lapel mic instead. For ease of operation, wireless lapel mics that include the mic on a clip-on transmitter are far, far easier to set up than a traditional setup that runs wires under a subject's clothes.</p>&#13;
			<p>Different environments require different approaches, and recording good sound is important. Having several kinds of microphones with you lets you use them all at once, then find out which sounds best in the editing bay. However, when you record your audio, always, always plug in a pair of headphones (and wear them!) to make sure you're recording a clear signal.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-60"><a id="_idTextAnchor063"/>Other accessories</h2>&#13;
			<p>Cameras are often <a id="_idIndexMarker108"/>supplemented with support gear, such as tripods, gimbals, body straps, mounts, cages, and handles. Add these as you need them, but don't go crazy. <strong class="bold">Gear Acquisition Syndrome</strong> (<strong class="bold">GAS</strong>) is a real<a id="_idIndexMarker109"/> addiction, and it's an expensive one. Heavier cameras need more expensive support gear, too.</p>&#13;
			<p><em class="italic">Lighting is hugely important</em>, and if you can't add your own lights, you'll need to learn how to position your subject to maximize available light. As with microphones, you'll need different lights for different purposes, such as small, camera-mounted lights, larger lights that live on stands, and more. You'll find plenty of advice online; start with a quick search for "three-point lighting" and learn as you go.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-61"><a id="_idTextAnchor064"/>Review — choosing a camera and audio equipment</h2>&#13;
			<p>Armed with all<a id="_idIndexMarker110"/> that information, what are you going<a id="_idIndexMarker111"/> to buy? Your budget will guide you, and you'll probably start on the lower end, building up to something more expensive over time. As a starting point, consider the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Use your phone to start. Put all the quality options to maximum, use it for a couple of test jobs, see if you're happy with it, and assess <span>its flaws.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>If your phone isn't good enough for what you need, get a good mirrorless camera, with a capable zoom and at least one prime lens for low-light and blurred backgrounds. Make sure the camera has a microphone and a headp<span>hone jack.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Get a microphone or wireless lapel system that you can plug into yo<span>ur camera.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Get a solid video tripod that lets you pan and tilt<span> smoothly.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Once you've mastered that setup and you're looking for more, consider the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Get an audio recorder that works with your microphones (such as an XLR or minijack). You can use this as a backup or primary aud<span>io source.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Get another camera for dual-camera shoots and backup purposes. This should be the same brand as your primary camera and should record in the same formats, but could be a chea<span>per model.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Get some lights and learn how to use <span>them well.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Get an action camera, a 360° camera, or a drone to provide different kinds of shots to add variety to <span>your edit.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Buy a gimbal if you need to capture smooth walking or running <span>movements.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>If or when you <a id="_idIndexMarker112"/>hit the limits of what your camera <a id="_idIndexMarker113"/>can do, consider moving up to a more professional camera and/or lenses with proper manual focu<span>s control:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer059" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_2.13_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 2.13: Not all lenses allow proper manual focus, but this &quot;clutch&quot; focus ring does"/>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.13: Not all lenses allow proper manual focus, but this "clutch" focus<span> ring does</span></p>&#13;
			<p>That's it for a starting point. If you're planning on shooting videos yourself, it's a good checklist to use, and if you're working with others, it's a good checklist of questions you should be asking them. Not every job requires all this gear — I've worked on many jobs where audio is unimportant and I can't add lights — but every videographer needs at least a basic kit. With that kit, what should they capture?</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-62"><a id="_idTextAnchor065"/>Shooting the right shots</h1>&#13;
			<p>Whatever kind of<a id="_idIndexMarker114"/> camera you end up with, you will need to capture a variety of shots to make the edit run smoothly. If you've planned well, you'll go into a shoot with a list of shots that you need to capture, and it's very satisfying to tick them off as you go.</p>&#13;
			<p>The shots you need will vary from shoot to shoot, but it's rare that you can simply capture a subject once from a single angle and be done. Nearly always, you'll want to capture two different kinds of footage: A-roll and B-roll.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-63"><a id="_idTextAnchor066"/>A-roll</h2>&#13;
			<p>This is <a id="_idIndexMarker115"/>simply <em class="italic">the primary video that you need to capture</em>. If people speak on camera or to a camera, that's A-roll:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer060" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_2.14_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 2.14: A subject talking on camera? That's A-roll (from Brad Olsen's Off the Tracks)"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.14: A subject talking on camera? That's A-roll (from Brad Olsen's Off t<span>he Tracks)</span></p>&#13;
			<p>In dramas, a scene where people are talking is A-roll, and in a corporate piece, the interviews are A-roll. This is the spine of the story — the driving message keeping the viewer's attention — and it can be captured on one or more cameras:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer061" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_2.15_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 2.15: A subject on camera, but not talking? That's probably not A-roll (from Brad Olsen's Off the Tracks)"/>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.15: A subject on camera, but not talking? That's probably not A-roll (from Brad Olsen's Off t<span>he Tracks)</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The term A-roll isn't widely used today, but it's still a useful descriptive term for your primary story-telling<a id="_idIndexMarker116"/> footage. Yet without A-roll, we wouldn't have…</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-64"><a id="_idTextAnchor067"/>B-roll</h2>&#13;
			<p>This is <em class="italic">a secondary video that illustrates or augments the A-roll</em>. In a corporate video, if a CEO is<a id="_idIndexMarker117"/> talking about how proud they are of their new website, then the B-roll could be a shot of someone using that website on a phone or computer:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer062" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_2.16_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 2.16: A related keyboard shot that you could use to cover an edit? That's B-roll (from Brad Olsen's Off the Tracks)"/>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.16: A related keyboard shot that you could use to cover an edit? That's B-roll (from Brad Olsen's Off t<span>he Tracks)</span></p>&#13;
			<p>In an interview, maybe you have a close-up of the interviewee's hands moving, doing their normal tasks around the office, or an over-the-shoulder shot from behind the interviewer. B-roll can also include shots in the location of an interview to use at the beginning of a piece to set the scene:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer063" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_2.17_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 2.17: A scene-setting wide shot? That's also B-roll (from Brad Olsen's Off the Tracks)"/>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.17: A scene-setting wide shot? That's also B-roll (from Brad Olsen's Off t<span>he Tracks)</span></p>&#13;
			<p>How much B-roll do you need? Lots. <em class="italic">A handy rule for B-roll is 5 x 5 x 5</em>, which means that for each <a id="_idIndexMarker118"/>subject, you should capture 5-second shots from 5 different angles at 5 different focal lengths. In the edit, you will need the flexibility that these shots will give you, and viewers will notice if you simply repeat the same shots or the same angles. <em class="italic">A camera operator can't shoot enough B-roll, and an editor never w</em><em class="italic">ants less</em>.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-65"><a id="_idTextAnchor068"/>Movement</h2>&#13;
			<p>B-roll can be <strong class="bold">static</strong>, a fixed <a id="_idIndexMarker119"/>shot from a tripod, or <strong class="bold">moving</strong>, which could be hand-held, or a pan, tilt, or dolly on a tripod, slider or gimbal. Slow, subtle movements can be used as a way to bring life to an otherwise static shot, but there's no shame in using a tripod. Where possible, I try to <em class="italic">capture both static and moving options</em><em class="italic"> together</em>:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Start recording whi<span>le static.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Wait for 5 seconds (hold on to y<span>our shot).</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Pan or tilt smoothly to a second<span> position.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Finally, wait for another 5 seconds (hold on to your sh<span>ot again).</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Stop <span>recording.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>This gives me flexibility in the edit because I can use the static first part or the static second part if I need a still shot, or I can use the movement between, with or without the start or end of that movement. Static shots and moving shots don't always work well next to one another, so give yourself a selection of both types and ways to move between them. If you're <a id="_idIndexMarker120"/>shooting with a hand-held device, keep your movements slow and intentional:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer064" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_2.18_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 2.18: With a gimbal, your hand can go way out to the side, but the camera stays rock solid"/>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.18: With a gimbal, your hand can go way out to the side, but the camera stays <span>rock solid</span></p>&#13;
			<p>As you shoot, visualize how it's going to look in the edit, and <em class="italic">shoot footage to be edited</em>. You'll do a better job as a shooter if you know how editing works, and it's easier to edit footage that was shot with editing in mind. </p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-66"><a id="_idTextAnchor069"/>Focus pulling</h2>&#13;
			<p>If you don't have a<a id="_idIndexMarker121"/> good tripod or the environment isn't big enough to allow movement, you can try to get fancy without moving by using a focus pull (also known as a rack focus). This requires a real lens with manual focus, and the process is simple:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer065" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_2.19_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 2.19: Focusing from the back to the front"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.19: Focusing from the back to<span> the front</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Start with a foreground subject in focus, wait for a few seconds, then smoothly shift the focus to an object in the background. Wait for a few seconds, then come back the other way. Repeat if you<a id="_idIndexMarker122"/> missed the focus. This provides movement without physically moving.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-67"><a id="_idTextAnchor070"/>Different perspectives</h2>&#13;
			<p>B-roll is your chance <a id="_idIndexMarker123"/>to bring interesting shots to your edit, so experiment with low angles, high angles, or cameras mounted on an object in the shot. Use high frame rates for dedicated slow-motion shots that need it. Consider using a moderately high frame rate (50 or 60 fps) for all B-roll footage to allow you to choose between normal and 50% speed in the edit:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer066" class="figure">&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.20: This slow-motion close-up of beer being poured is a great sc<span>ene setter</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Use macro lenses for extreme close-ups or drones for a bird's-eye view. The reason why most general snapshots look the same these days is not that they're all shot on phones, but that they're mostly <a id="_idIndexMarker124"/>shot from eye height looking straight out. Get down, up, close, and far away, and you'll bring a variety that your clients weren't expecting.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-68"><a id="_idTextAnchor071"/>Framing</h2>&#13;
			<p>In both A-roll and B-roll, the<a id="_idIndexMarker125"/> composition of the frame is important, and your approach to this will depend on whether you're oversampling (for example, shooting 4K for a 1080p deliverable) or not. If you're shooting in the same resolution that you want to deliver, you'll have to frame things pretty accurately on set and learn the terminology, such as medium shot, close-up, and so on:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer067" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_2.21_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 2.21: Shooting the same subject from multiple angles gives you editing choices"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.21: Shooting the same subject from multiple angles gives you editi<span>ng choices</span></p>&#13;
			<p>However, if you have extra resolution to play with, you should shoot a wider scene than normal and make the final crop in the edit suite. This gives you the freedom to zoom in on a subject for emphasis or zoom out to make room for a title next to your subject. It will also help if your client suddenly requests a deliverable in a new aspect ratio, such as square (1:1) or vertical (9:16):</p>&#13;

			<p>You'll find many guides<a id="_idIndexMarker126"/> for composition out there, but the "rule of thirds" is a good one to bear in mind, and it is probably built into your camera. Here's an iPhone screen:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer069" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_2.23_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 2.23: The rule of thirds can be enabled in Settings, under Camera"/>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.23: The rule of thirds can be enabled in Settings, un<span>der Camera</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Over your frame, imagine (or turn on!) a grid that breaks the screen up into three parts vertically and<a id="_idIndexMarker127"/> horizontally. When composing, place interesting things (such as a subject's eyes) at the intersection of these lines, 1/3 and 2/3 of the way across and down the screen.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-69"><a id="_idTextAnchor072"/>Review — shooting the right shots</h2>&#13;
			<p>Within A-roll and B-roll, you've<a id="_idIndexMarker128"/> got many ways to compose your shots, and many ways to move your camera about. If you're shooting yourself, it's easy to start simply and build up from there. After all, if you've got the basics covered, you can safely experiment with unusual angles and shots that don't work every time. Even if you'd prefer to stay firmly in the editing bay, now you know what to ask your collaborators for.</p>&#13;
			<p>Next, you'll find out what to do when a single device isn't enough.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-70"><a id="_idTextAnchor073"/>Working with multiple cameras and audio recorders</h1>&#13;
			<p>While a single <a id="_idIndexMarker129"/>camera is often all you need, shooting with multiple cameras brings many benefits and can be especially useful during live events when you simply can't ask your subjects to give you another take. A second camera also works as a backup should your main camera have an issue, such as a failed battery, being out of focus, or if someone's standing in front of it:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer070" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_2.24_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 2.24: Two angles with a similar focal length, but from different perspectives"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.24: Two angles with a similar focal length, but from different pe<span>rspectives</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The second angle isn't just a backup; you want the two (or more) angles to provide different perspectives because there's not a lot of benefit in two cameras capturing similar content. Angles that are too similar don't work well in the edit either. Two sequential shots that show almost the same thing are called a <em class="italic">jump cut</em>, and while their use has become more common, it's something that is best avoided if you have the option. While your angles need to be different, they also need to avoid capturing other camera operators in the same shot, and that often makes using three cameras a tricky proposition.</p>&#13;
			<p>Another factor to consider is "crossing the line." Imagine that you're filming an interview between two people (<strong class="bold">A</strong> and <strong class="bold">B</strong>) facing each other in front of you — <strong class="bold">A</strong> on the left and <strong class="bold">B</strong> on the right:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer071" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_2.25_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 2.25: Keep your cameras on the same side of your subjects to avoid crossing the line"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.25: Keep your cameras on the same side of your subjects to avoid crossin<span>g the line</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Any cameras you use should be placed on the same side of the two subjects to maintain that "<strong class="bold">A</strong>, <strong class="bold">B</strong>" order from left to right. If you cross the line, putting a camera behind them, they'd be shown<a id="_idIndexMarker130"/> in a "<strong class="bold">B</strong>, <strong class="bold">A</strong>" order, which is visually jarring to the viewer.</p>&#13;
			<p>Always remember that <em class="italic">FCP X can automatically sync your footage based on the audio recorded by all cameras and audio recorders</em>. As we will discuss in the next chapter, similar audio waveforms can be matched up, so you want to make sure that all the devices are recording roughly the same audio. If cameras and mics are placed a long way from one another, the different audio tracks won't have much in common and syncing can fail. If possible, ask your subjects to clap loudly on camera (or use a traditional clapperboard, yell, or use an air horn) to make your life much easier in the editing bay.</p>&#13;
			<p>Let's consider a few examples of when using multiple cameras is useful.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-71"><a id="_idTextAnchor074"/>Conference presentations</h2>&#13;
			<p>Conferences <a id="_idIndexMarker131"/>can be recorded and then shared. Be careful to use cameras that can safely record for long periods of time, and bring enough storage media and batteries!</p>&#13;
			<p>Video devices should record:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>A wide angle to capture the presentation alongside the<span> presenter</span></li>&#13;
				<li>A tighter angle to capture the prese<span>nter alone</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Audio devices should include:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>A lapel mic for the current<span> presenter</span></li>&#13;
				<li>A recorder capturing a feed from the <span>sound desk</span></li>&#13;
				<li>A backup recorder on t<span>he lectern</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Each camera can be exposed appropriately and the best of each combined in a picture-in-picture output. If it's possible to obtain the presentations directly, that's ideal, but some presenters will highlight parts of the screen with a laser pointer, so you really do have to film it as well.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-72"><a id="_idTextAnchor075"/>Interviews</h2>&#13;
			<p>Shooting an interview with multiple cameras gives you extra perspectives of the subject or can allow the <a id="_idIndexMarker132"/>interviewer to become part of the story. Any of these angles could be useful:</p>&#13;
			<p>Video devices should record:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>A normal "head and shoulders" primary angle of the i<span>nterviewee</span></li>&#13;
				<li>A wider angle of the interviewee positioned 30° from the pri<span>mary angle</span></li>&#13;
				<li>A normal angle of the interviewer, if they're<span> important</span></li>&#13;
				<li>A wider angle of both the interviewer and i<span>nterviewee</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Audio devices should include:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Lapel mics on each p<span>articipant</span></li>&#13;
				<li>A backup<span> recording</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>These <a id="_idIndexMarker133"/>guidelines apply for a single interviewee, but you may want to use additional devices for more than one interviewee. Don't forget your B-roll!</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-73"><a id="_idTextAnchor076"/>Physical movement</h2>&#13;
			<p>When recording educational videos of people performing physical actions — such as lifting, moving <a id="_idIndexMarker134"/>their bodies, sitting down, or dancing — it can be very helpful to see them from multiple angles at once. Resetting cameras takes time, so ask your subject to turn to show the two most important angles in any movement.</p>&#13;
			<p>Video devices should record:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>A fron<span>t-on angle</span></li>&#13;
				<li>A side-on angle at 90° from the f<span>irst angle</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Audio devices should include:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>A lapel mic on an on-screen or off-screen narrator, although you might replace this duri<span>ng editing</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>When framing, remember to capture the entire person if that's important, and always ask a subject matter expert to verify that the important actions are being captured.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-74"><a id="_idTextAnchor077"/>Weddings and live events</h2>&#13;
			<p>Many live events have predictable key moments that need to be captured, and for a wedding, they <a id="_idIndexMarker135"/>would <a id="_idIndexMarker136"/>include exchanging rings, vows, walking down the aisle, speeches, dances, presentations, and impromptu interviews. Prepare to capture all the key moments and be ready for anything else.</p>&#13;
			<p>Video devices should record:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>A focused angle of all the<span> key shots</span></li>&#13;
				<li>A backup angle from a differen<span>t position</span></li>&#13;
				<li>A wider-angle shot to give context and crowd<span> reactions</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Audio<a id="_idIndexMarker137"/> devices should<a id="_idIndexMarker138"/> include:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>A recorder capturing a<span> desk feed</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Lapel mics for anyone<span> important</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Camera-mounted mics for ambiance an<span>d a backup</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Reliable equipment and a quick response are critical, because you're not in charge here. As ever, you'll still need B-roll.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-75"><a id="_idTextAnchor078"/>Review — working with multiple cameras and audio recorders</h2>&#13;
			<p>Multiple cameras <a id="_idIndexMarker139"/>are vital for a lot of jobs, but they do require more attention and care. If you're just getting started and those lists of equipment sound daunting, that's OK — just don't take on a wedding as your first paying job! There are many simpler jobs for which a single camera is plenty, and you should start there, as complexity brings risk. Be sure to practice multi-camera setups alone before you try to do it in front of a client, and build a network of other camera and sound professionals to work with; don't try to do everything yourself.</p>&#13;
			<p>As a shooter, you want to make sure you get all the shots the editor needs, and as an editor, you don't want to be left to rescue a shoot gone wrong. Multi-camera shoots are a great way to increase flexibility and protect against problems, but even in a single-camera shoot, there are a few small details to pay attention to, and you'll learn them next.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-76"><a id="_idTextAnchor079"/>Managing everything on set</h1>&#13;
			<p>You've picked a <a id="_idIndexMarker140"/>camera and audio recorders, everything's charged, and you know what kinds of shots to capture — what next?</p>&#13;
			<p>Most importantly, if you're working with more than one device, be sure to synchronize the clocks (to the second!) on all of the devices before you record anything. This will make the syncing process far easier, and you'd be surprised at how quickly cameras and recorders can drift from the correct time.</p>&#13;
			<p>If you've bought a camera that lets you customize the names of the files it produces, set up each camera to make files with different names. My A and B cameras make files that start with <strong class="source-inline">P_IA</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">P_IB</strong> to make life easy, and a shooting colleague uses <strong class="source-inline">P1RC</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">P2RC</strong>. With or without this feature, label the physical media cards so that you don't get confused about which <a id="_idIndexMarker141"/>card is which:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer072" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_2.26_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 2.26: No duplicate names here, and I can tell at a glance which camera each clip was shot on"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.26: No duplicate names here, and I can tell at a glance which camera each clip w<span>as shot on</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Some cameras have two card slots, and this can be a lifesaver if you're recording to both slots at once as a guard against faulty SD cards. Alternatively, you can record different kinds of media to each card (which is good if you're shooting photos as well as video) or simply fill up the second card once the first is full. That's less safe, but it means you never run out of space; you can swap the card that's not currently in use while the other card records. This is a dangerous operation, though. If you accidentally eject the wrong card, your current clip, no matter how long it is, could be entirely corrupted and unusable. Use this with great caution.</p>&#13;
			<p>Similar caution is needed around using mains power rather than batteries with your cameras and recorders. If you have to connect main power via the usual battery compartment and the power is somehow interrupted, you can lose your entire current clip. Batteries will eventually run out, but they are significantly safer.</p>&#13;
			<p>A final question — should you shoot as well as edit? On a smaller production, shooting the video you're going to edit can be a big time-saver because you'll know what you want, you'll remember what you shot, and you'll have a much easier time when reviewing the footage. You'll also get to know the kinds of shots you need to capture. Editors and camera operators can do their own jobs better if they each know how the other job works.</p>&#13;
			<p>However, larger budgets mean more specialization, and on larger productions, some editors actually prefer not to be involved in the shoot at all. That's because a crew might spend hours getting a<a id="_idIndexMarker142"/> perfect shot, and they can become emotionally attached to that shot in the edit. In contrast, an editor who wasn't there can choose to use that shot — or throw it away — on its own merits. If you're doing both jobs yourself, remember that <em class="italic">most of what you shoot will probably be thrown away</em>, and that's OK.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-77"><a id="_idTextAnchor080"/>Review — managing everything on set</h2>&#13;
			<p>These details seem<a id="_idIndexMarker143"/> small, but ignoring them can have serious conquences. If it's not easy to know which camera a file came from, it can be lost. If one file has the same name as another file, it can be mistaken for it, or even overwritten by accident. Battery failure is real, and cables can be tripped over; all you can do is your best. Get to know how the set works, even if you aren't always there, and you'll be a better editor.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-78"><a id="_idTextAnchor081"/>Summary</h1>&#13;
			<p>If you're just starting out with your first edit, I hope this chapter hasn't overloaded your brain. There's a lot to take in and plenty of mistakes to be made. If you prefer to stay in the edit bay, I hope this chapter has given you some insight into what a videographer has to consider, and you won't feel left out the next time you find yourself talking to someone about cameras, resolutions, codecs, or shutter speed. You'll also know what to request or shoot yourself — <em class="italic">lots of B-roll, at different angles, with movement and without, and from unique per</em><em class="italic">spectives</em>.</p>&#13;
			<p>OK, that's enough for now. If you can, go out and shoot something, and grab lots of B-roll. If you can't, head to a free online video source, such as <a href="http://pexels.com">pexels.com</a>, to download as many clips as you can.
