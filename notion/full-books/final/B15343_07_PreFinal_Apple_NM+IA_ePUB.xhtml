			<p class="author-quote">"If FCP X had gotten rid of tracks and made no other paradigm changes, I'd still be an acolyte. Just from that one breakthrough! But instead of stopping there, the team reimagined what non-linear editing could be at every single step, and they got so much of it right. It really is like driving a Tesla while the legacy systems are chugging along in a four-cylinder station wagon. Sure, we'll all get to the same place in the end. But us FCP X drivers are having a lot more fun on<span> the way."</span></p>&#13;
			<p class="author-quote-source">— Michael Yanovich, A.C.E.</p>&#13;
			<p class="author-quote-source">M.Y. is a Los Angeles-based editor who works on feature films and TV shows, is a decent guitar player, and totally sucks on drums. But plays them anyway. (<a href="http://FilmYak.com">FilmYak.com</a>)</p>&#13;
			<p>We're starting to get somewhere, but there's a long way to go yet. So far, we've got some good video on the timeline, we've put it in the right order, and we've trimmed it down. But in terms of editing, what we've done is still pretty simple. While the Primary Storyline should always be the spine of the story, there are many reasons why you'd want to put clips above or below that spine.</p>&#13;
			<p>Final Cut Pro X takes a unique approach: it doesn't just place higher clips at a point in time, it connects them to clips on the Primary Storyline. While that makes many operations more flexible, it's different from the traditional track-based paradigm, and if you're an experienced editor, this is a chapter you'll want to read carefully. In detail, this chapter covers the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Understandin<span>g cutaways</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Connec<span>ting clips</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Grouping connected clips in <span>Storylines</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Controlling and overriding c<span>onnections</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Three-point editin<span>g and more</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to make more sophisticated edits, hide your edits to make the overall product smoother, and understand how Final Cut does it differently and how to place clips in particular spots. Remember: video editors are liars, and the good ones get away with it. You'll find out how, right now.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-196"><a id="_idTextAnchor203"/>Understanding cutaways</h1>&#13;
			<p>A <strong class="bold">cutaway</strong> is<a id="_idIndexMarker447"/> the term for video placed above the main story to hide edits underneath. While a person in a video probably said the words they appeared to, they probably didn't manage to say them all in the right order, without interruptions. Removing the <em class="italic">ums</em>, <em class="italic">ahs</em>, and pauses<a id="_idTextAnchor204"/> <a id="_idIndexMarker448"/>leaves visible <strong class="bold">jump cuts</strong>: two sequential shots with almost, but not quite, the same content. To hide the edits, an editor places a cutaway above the Primary Storyline, and while you still hear the words below, you don't see the jump cut.</p>&#13;
			<p>How does the editor find the right clip to "cut away" to? Usually, they use B-roll that's related to the current topic. An edit has to feel justified, so you can't just put any old clip on top. This is why editors want relevant B-roll; if you don't have enough, you won't be able to cover all of the edits you want to. </p>&#13;
			<p>Not all cutaways are B-roll, though. You might cut away to a reaction shot such as an interviewer nodding or a reverse angle of a character in a dramatic piece reacting to another. It could be a wider angle of the same scene, a close-up of an important detail, or something else. Cutaways allow timing to be adjusted beneath them, and by shifting the audience's gaze, can help you to maintain an illusion of continuity.</p>&#13;
			<p>As well as covering up an edit, cutaways can also be used above a continuous, unedited shot to break up a shot that's been on-screen for too long or to hide something. The defining factor of a cutaway is that it sits above the Primary Storyline rather than within it.</p>&#13;
			<p>At this point, I should note that the times, as ever, are a-changing, and jump cuts (created when part of a shot is removed and the edit is seen) are becoming more accepted in a wider range of productions. They've always been available as an occasional stylistic choice, but they've become far more mainstream over the last several years. When vlogging became popular, jump cuts were embraced wholeheartedly and since then, they've quickly spread to the rest of online video and back to mainstream TV and cinema. Don't feel that you must always disguise jump cuts, but they remain a jarring choice. Since "professional" media usually hides jump cuts, your clients may prefer if you avoid them too, but go with your gut and what the story demands.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">Technically, any two sequential clips of the same subject, shot within about 30° of one another and with the subject at a similar size, will usually appear as a jump cut. If you take out the middle of a single static shot, that's very likely to cause one, but changing scale and position on one side of the edit can help.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">You can also avoid cutaways and B-roll by shooting your subject from multiple simultaneous angles. Shooting two angles of the same person will keep the focus on your subject while giving you some options for avoiding jump cuts, and there's more on editing multicam media in the next chapter.</p>&#13;
			<p>At a really high level, this is the process you'll follow for any video that's driven by someone <a id="_idIndexMarker449"/>speaking on camera:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;

				<li>Connect B-roll cutaways on top of the Primary Storyline to hide edits and cover long, boring shots (this<span> chapter).</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>Most videos involve someone talking, but for anything else, you'll place clips above other clips simply when you want to cover something up or you want to stay flexible with regard to its position in time. You'll also use connected clips when you use keying (green screen) or picture-in-picture effects, but we'll return to those in <a href="B15343_12_PreFinal_Apple_SK+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor331"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></a>, <em class="italic">Refine and Smooth: Video Effects and Transitions</em>. Let's now prep some footage of someone talking — it's a simple, common situation that you'll need to deal with, and it's easy to understand.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-197"><a id="_idTextAnchor205"/>Preparing for a cutaway</h2>&#13;
			<p>Somewhere in<a id="_idIndexMarker450"/> your Library, you should have a shot of someone speaking. They don't have to be saying anything important for this exercise, but it helps if they've taken at least a brief pause between some of their words. The process starts simply:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Add a clip of someone speaking to your<span> timeline.</span><p>You now need to locate a part of this clip that you'd like to remove. Maybe it's an <em class="italic">um</em> in the middle of a good sentence; maybe it's a not-so-great sentence between two good ones. Maybe it's just a pause that's a little too long, a word that doesn't belong, or a stumbled word. Find it, and get ready.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">R</strong> to switch to the <strong class="bold">Range Selection</strong> tool, then click, drag, and release to select the problematic part of this clip. (Alternatively, hover b<span>efore and </span>&#13;
press <strong class="bold">I</strong>, then hover after and<span> press </span><span><strong class="bold">O</strong></span><span>):</span><div id="_idContainer242" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_7.1_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 7.1: Here, I've selected a less important sentence from this continuous shot&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.1: Here, I've selected a less important sentence from this conti<span>nuous shot</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>With the selection active, press <strong class="bold">d</strong><strong class="bold">elete</strong> to remove that section, leaving <span>two clips:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer243" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_7.2_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 7.2: Now there are two clips, but the cut will be obvious"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.2: Now there are two clips, but the cut will <span>be obvious</span></p>&#13;
			<p>You've made a jump cut. Now it's time to get the edit sounding right:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Use the <strong class="bold">Select</strong> tool (and perhaps the <strong class="bold">comma</strong> and <strong class="bold">period</strong> shortcuts) to trim the Out point of clip 1 and the In point of clip 2 to make sure it so<span>unds good.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Review and<a id="_idIndexMarker451"/> re-edit this cut as many times as you need, using the <strong class="bold">?</strong> "Play Around Edit" shortcut r<span>epeatedly.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>When it sounds good, you're done: don't worry about how it looks as it's about to be covered up. Remember that you can add a cutaway above any edit, jump cut or not, and whether the two clips are from the same shots or different ones — it's all good.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-198"><a id="_idTextAnchor206"/>Review — understanding cutaways</h2>&#13;
			<p>Now that you know what cutaways are all about, and you've prepared your timeline with a jump cut that sounds good but looks bad, the next step is always to connect the cutaway above. Remember that you can use cutaways in other situations too, and that jump cuts are just the most common example. Still, this is a common workflow and it's worth mastering. Let's find out how to cover that edit and anything else in this new connected world.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-199"><a id="_idTextAnchor207"/>Connecting clips</h1>&#13;
			<p>Any time you add a <a id="_idIndexMarker452"/>clip above or below other clips, you're connecting them — forming a parent-child relationship — and this section shows you how. While you might want to connect many types of clips (B-roll, sound effects, music, or titles), the most common thing to use as cutaway footage is B-roll video, to cover an edit, and that's where we'll begin. After looking at connecting video, we'll circle back to connecting audio and music and take a slightly deeper look.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-200"><a id="_idTextAnchor208"/>Connecting visual B-roll</h2>&#13;
			<p>You <a id="_idIndexMarker453"/>shot plenty of <a id="_idIndexMarker454"/>B-roll, right? Assuming that you have the right shots and you've organized them, you'll be able to use your keywords and favorites to quickly locate a shot that illustrates something being discussed by your interviewee. Here we go:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Using <strong class="bold">Keywords</strong> and <strong class="bold">Favorites</strong> in the Browser, locate a relevant B-<span>roll clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Select a 3–5 second section of <span>this clip.</span><p>Selecting the right part of the clip is an art — should it be static or moving? If there's motion in the shot, should you start or end on the action or show it in the middle? These are deeper content-related questions that I'll sidestep here, so just go with your gut and know you'll get better at it.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Hover in the <strong class="bold">Timeline</strong>, just before the visible<span> jump cut:</span><div id="_idContainer244" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_7.3_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 7.3: You can see that a selection has been made in the Browser, and the Skimmer is in place in the Timeline"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.3: You can see that a selection has been made in the Browser, and the Skimmer is in place in th<span>e Timeline</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">Q</strong> to connect <a id="_idIndexMarker455"/>the Browser clip above the jump cut<a id="_idIndexMarker456"/> in the<span> timeline:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer245" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_7.4_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 7.4: The B-roll clip has been connected above the Primary Storyline, and the browser clip has an orange line to indicate usage"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.4: The B-roll clip has been connected above the Primary Storyline, and the browser clip has an orange line to indi<span>cate usage</span></p>&#13;
			<p>So far, so good — you've<a id="_idIndexMarker457"/> connected a clip. Let's try drag and drop too:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Repeat the earlier steps: create another jump cut elsewhere in the timeline, then select a <a id="_idIndexMarker458"/>few seconds of a second relevant B-<span>roll clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Drag the selected part of the clip from the Browser to above a jump cut in the <strong class="bold">Timeline</strong>, and drop<span> it there:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer246" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_7.5_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 7.5: Dragging clearly shows the duration of the dragged clip before you drop it"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.5: Dragging clearly shows the duration of the dragged clip before y<span>ou drop it</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Drag and drop gives a nice visual preview of the length of the clip you're dragging, but using the keyboard is a little faster. Use either method or both, but you'll find that if the selected area of a clip in the Browser is small, you'll struggle to drag and drop it, and <strong class="bold">Q</strong> will work best.</p>&#13;
			<p>Those two options for connecting B-roll video also work for audio, but with a &#13;
few differences.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-201"><a id="_idTextAnchor209"/>Connecting sound effects</h2>&#13;
			<p>The process of finding and then <a id="_idIndexMarker459"/>connecting sound effects is similar, especially if you've imported your own audio into your Library. Here, we'll look in a different place:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Click on the <strong class="bold">Photos and Audio</strong> icon at the top-left of th<span>e Browser</span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Click on <strong class="bold">Sound Effects</strong> to access the built-in bank of sound effects and short music pieces. (Note: If these are missing, choose <strong class="bold">Final Cut Pro</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Download Additional Content</strong> to get them <span>for free.)</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Final Cut Pro Sound Effects</strong> or <strong class="bold">iLife Sound Effects</strong> category from the menu in the <span>top-right.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Move through the list and <a id="_idIndexMarker460"/>preview one or more sound effects by press<span>ing </span><span><strong class="bold">Space</strong></span><span>:</span><div id="_idContainer247" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_7.6_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 7.6: Start by clicking on the icon in the top left, then choose what to look at with the menu in the top right"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.6: Start by clicking on the icon in the top left, then choose what to look at with the menu in the<span> top right</span></p><p>There are hundreds of effects here, from explosions to wind, to telephones ringing and children laughing. It doesn't have to totally make sense in the context of your shot — squeaky toys used instead of footsteps are pretty funny. Of course, you can use your own banks of sound effects too. They can be stored in <strong class="bold">iTunes</strong> or the <strong class="bold">Apple Music</strong> app, then accessed in the list above <strong class="bold">Sound Effects</strong>. Alternatively, simply import audio clips from the Finder to your Library when needed.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>When you find a sound effect appropriate for something in your timeline, with or without a jump cut, press <strong class="bold">Q</strong> to connect it (this adds the entire sound effect, but if you <a id="_idIndexMarker461"/>want only part of it, select <span>it first):</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer248" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_7.7_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 7.7: Here, a &quot;cough&quot; sound has been added below the main Storyline, possibly relevant in this video about health checks on entering a hospital"/>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.7: Here, a "cough" sound has been added below the main Storyline, possibly relevant in this video about health checks on entering <span>a hospital</span></p>&#13;
			<p>When you connect an audio clip, you'll see that it connects below the vision rather than above, but you'll still hear it. While you can always hear all of the clips at any point in a timeline, in general, you'll only see the highest clip in the stack. There are exceptions with regard to keying, cropping, or blending, but as the purpose of a cutaway is to cover up the clips below, it works well. Video above and audio below is a simple rule and keeps the timeline uncluttered:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer249" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_7.8_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 7.8: Drag this line to adjust the volume of a clip"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.8: Drag this line to adjust the volume<span> of a clip</span></p>&#13;
			<p>While audio will be explored more thoroughly in <a href="B15343_14_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor404"><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em></a>, <em class="italic">Boost the Signal: Audio Sweetening</em>, know that you can change the volume of any clip by dragging on the horizontal line running above its waveform. There's much more to it, but that's all you need for now.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-202"><a id="_idTextAnchor210"/>Connecting only audio or video</h2>&#13;
			<p>Often, a clip with both<a id="_idIndexMarker462"/> audio and video tracks is only partly useful. Maybe the audio portion of an interview is useful, but the video is out of focus. Maybe the vision of cars in traffic is great, but the sound is unusably distorted. You can deal with this situation in a couple of different ways: by hiding or silencing what you don't want or not adding it to the timeline in the first place. First, here's how to hide it:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>One method to mute visual B-roll so it can't be heard is to <strong class="bold">Silenc</strong><span><strong class="bold">e</strong></span><span> it. The </span>&#13;
<strong class="bold">Modify</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Adjust Volume</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Silence</strong> (<strong class="bold">-∞</strong>) command is the quickest way to do this, but you could also drag the clip's volume line all of the way to the bottom of the clip (if you followed the steps in <a href="B15343_01_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor013"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Quick Start: An Introduction to FCP X</em>, to set up a custom shortcut, you could press <span><strong class="bold">zero</strong></span><span> now):</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer250" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_7.9_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 7.9: That top clip didn't have useful audio, so I turned it down"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.9: That top clip didn't have useful audio, so I turn<span>ed it down</span></p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>To hide the video component of a clip but keep the audio, connect the clip underneath the Primary Storyline. That way, it's hidden, but you ca<span>n hear it.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>If you know that you never want to see the vision or hear the audio for a particular clip, there's a small menu next to the edit buttons that will change how they work:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer251" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_7.10_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 7.10: If you choose to bring in only Video or Audio, the icons will change to reflect this"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.10: If you choose to bring in only Video or Audio, the icons will change to re<span>flect this</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The default option of <strong class="bold">All</strong> brings in an entire clip, but if you choose <strong class="bold">Video Only</strong> or <strong class="bold">Audio Only</strong>, then that's all you get. With video only, there's no audio to make quieter, and with audio only, there's <a id="_idIndexMarker463"/>no image to see:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer252" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_7.11_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 7.11: With no audio, there's no waveform at all and no volume line"/>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.11: With no audio, there's no waveform at all and no v<span>olume line</span></p>&#13;
			<p>However you connect your clips, and whatever kind of clips you connect, it's not just a name — Final Cut makes an explicit, visible connection between a Primary Storyline clip and a clip above or below it:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer253" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_7.12_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 7.12: The line at the lower left of Clip E indicates which clip it's connected to"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.12: The line at the lower left of Clip E indicates which clip it's co<span>nnected to</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Normally these connections are small stubs, but they become visible when a clip on either side of the connection is selected. These connections aren't just for show; they change the way editing works and are worth a deeper look.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-203"><a id="_idTextAnchor211"/>Understanding connections</h2>&#13;
			<p>Probably the biggest difference <a id="_idIndexMarker464"/>between a traditional editing timeline and the FCP X Magnetic Timeline is the way in which clips sit above or below other clips. In a traditional editing application, a clip's timecode is the most important factor: clips sit at a point in time, and any relationship between two clips positioned above or below one another is merely implied. Such clips can move out of sync with each other if you're not careful.</p>&#13;
			<p>Here in FCP X, clips on the Primary Storyline form the spine around which everything else is built: clips above or below are always connected to a clip on the Primary Storyline, no matter how many clips there are in the stack. When a clip with connections is moved, the connected clips also move, and when a clip with connections is deleted, the connected clips are also deleted. Logically, this makes sense: a shot of a car should be connected to a person talking about that car. It's even clearer for sound effects: a sound effect of a car backfiring belongs to a specific time within a shot of a car. Music behaves a little differently though.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-204"><a id="_idTextAnchor212"/>Working with music</h2>&#13;
			<p>The process of connecting a music clip<a id="_idIndexMarker465"/> is much the same as connecting any other clip: find a clip, select all or part of it, then connect it with <strong class="bold">Q</strong>. Therefore, to add background music for an entire edit, you'd connect that clip at the very start of a timeline. That makes a connection to the first clip on the Primary Storyline: perhaps a regular video clip or even a Gap clip. But be wary, because this can become complex, and this timeline isn't unusual:</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.13: Here's a real-world finished job, with <span>plenty of </span>&#13;
connected clips, and music connected at<span> the start</span></p>&#13;
			<p>A music clip can be quite long, a few minutes or so, and like any connected clip, it can only have a single connection point. Here's the issue: even though the music may drive an edit, later edit points aren't explicitly connected to specific points in the music. They can't be, as each clip has only one connection point. For background music that doesn't interact with the edit, this isn't a problem at all — move your edits around as much as you like and it'll work well. But if you want the whole edit to be driven by the music, don't move the initial clip where the audio is connected.</p>&#13;
			<p>Moving that first video clip (or Gap clip) would shift the music in time throughout the whole edit. Any implied sync moments, where a later edit works with the music at that time, would be lost — this includes edits placed on beats and lip-synced performances. To avoid problems, you'll want to apply any ripple trim edits to only the last couple of clips you've added, working from<a id="_idIndexMarker466"/> left to right in the Primary Storyline. Any edits earlier on the timeline would change the sync relationship between later clips and their accompanying music. Also, deleting that first video clip would be disastrous because the audio would disappear with it.</p>&#13;
			<p>While none of these sync problems are unique to FCP X, connections and the Magnetic Timeline can make the process of editing a music video a little different from other types of jobs. Because many of the video clips in a music video should be explicitly connected to specific, different points in the audio, one reasonable approach is to place the audio track on the Primary Storyline and then to connect all video above it:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer255" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_7.14_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 7.14: This music video (Gravitate by Ky.) uses several connected Storylines above a music track in the Primary Storyline"/>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.14: This music video (Gravitate by Ky.) uses several connected Storylines above a music track in the Primary<span> Storyline</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Later on, once you have more of a handle on how things work, you might try a hybrid approach with audio connected to a primary clip as usual, and that's fine too. Music videos remain a special case, and in most other types of edits, you'll enjoy the local clip-based sync that connections enable.</p>&#13;
			<p>But there's something a little<a id="_idIndexMarker467"/> different with clips that aren't on the Primary Storyline. Connected clips can still be moved and can be trimmed by dragging their edges, but if you pay close attention, the cursor you'll see when trimming is a little different from trimming Primary Storyline clips.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-205"><a id="_idTextAnchor213"/>Trimming connected clips</h2>&#13;
			<p>Hovering over the edges of a <a id="_idIndexMarker468"/>connected clip, you'll see that while the cursor shows the end or beginning of a clip, it doesn't show the filmstrip below that points to the clip being adjusted:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer256" class="figure">&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.15: There's no filmstrip on the cursor when you trim an independently conn<span>ected clip</span></p>&#13;
			<p>That part of the icon indicated that a ripple operation was taking place, affecting other clips in the timeline. There's no filmstrip here because trimming a connected clip doesn't affect anything else — every connected clip is independent:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

			<p>In the <strong class="bold">Viewer</strong>, you'll only<a id="_idIndexMarker469"/> see the clip that's highest in the stack at a point in time, and if the wrong clip is on top, you can drag clips directly up or down to change the stacking order. (A quick tip: hold <strong class="bold">⇧</strong> as you move a clip up or down to avoid also moving it in time.)</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-206"><a id="_idTextAnchor214"/>Review — connecting clips</h2>&#13;
			<p>That was a big section. From <a id="_idIndexMarker470"/>learning about cutaways to adding video above, adding audio below, learning how connections work, considering music, then trimming…connections are powerful and used in all but the simplest of edits. Still, connected clips don't really interact with one another: when you move a connected clip up, down, left, or right, it's the only thing that moves. Other nearby connected clips stay exactly where they're already connected and aren't pushed around. What if you want other connected clips to move around, rippling and rearranging like clips on the Primary Storyline? There's a solution: Storylines.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-207"><a id="_idTextAnchor215"/>Grouping connected clips in Storylines</h1>&#13;
			<p>Connected <a id="_idIndexMarker471"/>clips are great, but as they're totally independent, they <a id="_idIndexMarker472"/>can feel somewhat limited, and grouping two or more clips together in a gray box is the solution. To use the ripple-trim and rearranging magic of the Magnetic Timeline on connected clips, you'll need to wrap one or more clips up into a <strong class="bold">Storyline</strong>, and here's the process:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Select multiple nearby connected clips by dragging a selection box ar<span>ound them:</span><div id="_idContainer259" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_7.18_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 7.18: Each of these connected clips has its own connection line"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.18: Each of these connected clips has its own conne<span>ction line</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">⌘G</strong> to place those clips inside a <strong class="bold">Storyline</strong> (the <strong class="bold">Create Storyline</strong> command is in the <strong class="bold">C</strong><span><strong class="bold">lip</strong></span><span> menu):</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer260" class="figure">&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.19: These two selected clips have been placed in a Storyline with a single conne<span>ction line</span></p>&#13;
			<p>You'll see that the <a id="_idIndexMarker473"/>selected clips are placed within a <a id="_idIndexMarker474"/>gray box — that's the <strong class="bold">Storyline</strong>. While each of the clips was previously connected to separate Primary Storyline clips, there's now only one connection to the Storyline. The entire Storyline functions like a group and can be moved in time by selecting it, then dragging it or using the <strong class="bold">comma</strong> and <strong class="bold">period</strong> nudging shortcuts. And critically, rearranging and trimming clips inside a Storyline works just like it does on the Primary Storyline:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer261" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_7.20_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 7.20: Trimming the end of the first connected clip now closes gaps"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.20: Trimming the end of the first connected clip now c<span>loses gaps</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Storylines give<a id="_idIndexMarker475"/> you the power of the Magnetic <a id="_idIndexMarker476"/>Timeline with the flexibility of connections. They're great for visual B-roll where more than one clip is appropriate: place a few connected B-roll clips in a Storyline (perhaps above one or more jump cuts) to allow easier editing.</p>&#13;
			<p>They are also great for audio editing, even if you start with just a single clip inside one. If you place music or a longer voiceover in a Storyline, you can use the <strong class="bold">Range Selection</strong> tool to select anything you don't want, then press <strong class="bold">delete</strong> to close gaps automatically. Conversely, if you do want Gap clips in a Storyline (and you can make one with <strong class="bold">⇧delete</strong>), they can be extended in time to increase the length of a pause.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">Though we will come back to <strong class="bold">transitions</strong> much later in this book, if you add a transition to a connected clip (for example, a <strong class="bold">Dissolve</strong> with <strong class="bold">⌘T</strong>), then you'll automatically create a Storyline because transitions require them.</p>&#13;
			<p>There's another sneaky way to make a Storyline. If you drag a clip next to another connected clip, then hold <strong class="bold">G</strong> as you release, you'll see it snap in place into a newly created Storyline that holds both clips. Nice. </p>&#13;
			<p>The process of dragging a box to select multiple clips has a subtlety that's especially important with Storylines. If you drag sideways through a Storyline, you'll select the clips within it:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer262" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_7.21_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 7.21: Dragging sideways through a Storyline selects the clips within it"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.21: Dragging sideways through a Storyline selects the clips<span> within it</span></p>&#13;
			<p>However, if you<a id="_idIndexMarker477"/> drag vertically through a Storyline, you'll <a id="_idIndexMarker478"/>select the Storyline itself:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer263" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_7.22_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 7.22: Dragging vertically selects the Storyline and not the clips inside"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.22: Dragging vertically selects the Storyline and not the cl<span>ips inside</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The difference is important because you'll need to select clips (not a Storyline) if you want to adjust their properties in the Inspector, and you'll want to select the Storyline (not the clips) if you want to move the entire Storyline. It's not hard to get used to, but it is subtle.</p>&#13;
			<p>Finally, if you don't want one or more clips to be in a Storyline any more, just drag them upward and out of the gray enclosing box. Any remaining clips inside the Storyline will rearrange to close any gaps created, and if the last clip is removed, the Storyline will disappear. Note that you won't be able to drag a transition outside its Storyline because transitions can only exist within Storylines.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-208"><a id="_idTextAnchor216"/>Review – grouping connected clips in Storylines</h2>&#13;
			<p>Storylines are a <a id="_idIndexMarker479"/>great feature, and you'll pop clips in and out of<a id="_idIndexMarker480"/> them as you work through an edit. Grouping clips in Storylines is a key way to gain the gap-closing magnetic benefits of the Primary Storyline with the freedom of connected clips, and mastering them will be important as you build more complex edits. Connections from clips and Storylines to clips on the Primary Storyline are a big part of what makes editing in FCP X so fluid.</p>&#13;
			<p>However, those connections can sometimes cause trouble. If something goes wrong, you'll need to know how to force a clip to stay put. Let's find out how.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-209"><a id="_idTextAnchor217"/>Controlling and overriding connections</h1>&#13;
			<p>Normally, when you<a id="_idIndexMarker481"/> move a Primary Storyline clip around, any connected <a id="_idIndexMarker482"/>clips will move too. That's because the clip-to-clip connection is usually the most important, and it's what FCP X tries to maintain. Sometimes, though, you want to keep a connected clip exactly where it is, and this section will show you a couple of techniques to do that.</p>&#13;
			<p>First, if you want to connect a clip at a different point, hold <strong class="bold">⌥⌘</strong> and click on the connected clip. The connection will now be shifted to the clicked point in time, connecting to the clip on the Primary Storyline at that timecode. The same applies to Storylines, but you'll have to hold <strong class="bold">⌥⌘</strong> and click in the gray bar just above the clips instead:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer264" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_7.23_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 7.23: Here, the connection has been moved to the second clip in the Primary Storyline rather than the first"/>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.23: Here, the connection has been moved to the second clip in the Primary Storyline rather than<span> the first</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Moving connections like this lets you change which Primary Storyline clip "owns" a connected clip. As connected items are moved or deleted when a Primary Storyline clip is moved or deleted, this lets you decide which primary clips control those connected clips. For example, consider this timeline:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer265" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_7.24_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 7.24: Clip D is connected to Clip A"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.24: Clip D is connected<span> to Clip A</span></p>&#13;
			<p>If you want to <a id="_idIndexMarker483"/>delete <strong class="bold">Clip A</strong> but keep <strong class="bold">Clip D</strong> connected in place, you could <a id="_idIndexMarker484"/>first attach <strong class="bold">Clip D</strong> to a clip that follows <strong class="bold">Clip A</strong>:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer266" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_7.25_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 7.25: After repositioning, Clip D is now connected to Clip B"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.25: After repositioning, Clip D is now connected<span> to Clip B</span></p>&#13;
			<p><strong class="bold">Clip A</strong> can now be deleted safely. However, the connected <strong class="bold">Clip D</strong> will still move in time if its new "parent" <strong class="bold">Clip B</strong> moves after the deletion of <strong class="bold">Clip A</strong>:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer267" class="figure">&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.26: Clip A has been deleted, and Clip D now overlaps the previ<span>ous Clip E</span></p>&#13;
			<p>If that's not what you wanted, you have a few options:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Reposition <a id="_idIndexMarker485"/>connected clips to a point preceding (not following) the <a id="_idIndexMarker486"/>clip you're about to delete. This isn't always<span> possible.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Use <strong class="bold">⇧delete</strong> instead of <strong class="bold">delete</strong> to replace a clip with a Gap clip. The connected clips remain in the same spot with the same connecti<span>on points:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer268" class="figure">&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.27: Use ⇧delete to replace a clip with a Gap and keep all other clips wher<span>e they are</span></p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Use the <strong class="bold">Replace</strong> or <strong class="bold">Replace from Start</strong> feature to exchange one clip for another rather than deleting it. Replacing is covered in <a href="B15343_09_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor253"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Consider Your Options: Multicam, Replacing, and </em><span><em class="italic">Auditions</em></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Use the <strong class="bold">Position</strong> tool to overwrite Primary Storyline clips without affecting clips connected to that region. This is likely to affect timeline behavior in a more substantial way and so might not be appropriate. This is covered in <a href="B15343_10_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor271"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">Explore a Little: Compound Clips and Timeli</em><span><em class="italic">ne Tricks</em></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>There's one more solution that warrants deeper discussion:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Hold down the <strong class="bold">`</strong> key (<em class="italic">grave</em>, on the same key as <strong class="bold">~</strong> or <em class="italic">tilde</em>) to temporarily override connections on primary clips you're rearranging or <span>deleting. </span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>When holding <strong class="bold">`</strong>, you'll see an additional icon appear on your cursor:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer269" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_7.28_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 7.28: With ` held down, Clip B is moved"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.28: With ` held down, Clip <span>B is moved</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The "override connections" mode is an important toggle: any clips connected to the clip you're moving or deleting will <a id="_idIndexMarker487"/>stay where they are as if they weren't connected<a id="_idIndexMarker488"/> at all: </p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer270" class="figure">&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.29: When Clip B is dropped before Clip A, connected Clip D do<span>esn't move</span></p>&#13;
			<p>However, any clips connected to other Primary Storyline clips might still move around if their parents move as a result of the rearrangement or deletion:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer271" class="figure">&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.30: Starting from the earlier timeline, Clip B is moved later in the timeline past Clip C, and Clip E moves along w<span>ith Clip C</span></p>&#13;
			<p>That's normally just<a id="_idIndexMarker489"/> fine because you don't want to mess up an entire timeline <a id="_idIndexMarker490"/>worth of clip relationships, but the first time your connected clips jumble on top of one another, it may feel jarring. In the real world, this isn't normally much of a problem; you'd need to reposition the connected B-roll clips anyway.</p>&#13;
			<p>If you ever find yourself confused by what's going on, or a clip moves when you didn't expect, just Undo (<strong class="bold">⌘Z</strong>) and try again a different way. You'll also find that Replacing a clip is often a cleaner approach compared to deleting an old clip and then adding a new one — but more on replacing later.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-210"><a id="_idTextAnchor218"/>Review — controlling and overriding connections</h2>&#13;
			<p>While it's possible to stumble through an edit without it, you've learned how to reposition a connection with a quick <strong class="bold">⌥⌘-click</strong>, and that can be very helpful. Overriding a connection with <strong class="bold">`</strong> is similarly important, and you've learned about other options too. Connections can occasionally be complex, but their benefits are worth a little juggling from time to time.</p>&#13;
			<p>Next, you'll learn about a more precise way to work, where you explicitly define the region in a timeline where you'll add a clip.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-211"><a id="_idTextAnchor219"/>Three-point editing and more</h1>&#13;
			<p>You may not have considered it, but most edits<a id="_idIndexMarker491"/> are defined in terms of the source clip (which part of a clip you want to use) rather than the timeline (where do you want the clip to go). However, it's possible to prioritize the timeline instead, and this is sometimes called "three-point editing," because technically, at least three points are defined every time you add a clip. It's a traditional method, and here, you'll learn about how to mark part of the timeline to receive a clip and how to connect or overwrite a clip to that region.</p>&#13;
			<p>So far, we've added connected clips in a somewhat haphazard, less controlled way, by selecting a few seconds of a clip and then pressing <strong class="bold">Q</strong>. That means that the three points are the In (1) and Out (2) on a Browser clip, plus an In (3) point on the timeline.</p>&#13;
			<p>But you can flip that "source clip dominance" around by explicitly placing two of those points on the timeline. To connect a new clip in a specific region, do the following:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">In the Browser, skim<a id="_idIndexMarker492"/> over a clip you'd like to connect at a point you'd like to start from, and press <strong class="bold">I</strong> to mark an<span> In point.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>In the timeline, skim to a point where you want to add the connected clip, and press <strong class="bold">I</strong> to mark an<span> In point.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Skim to where you want to end the conne<span>cted clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">O</strong> to mark an <span>Out point:</span><div id="_idContainer272" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_7.31_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 7.31: On the timeline, make sure you have an In and Out selected"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.31: On the timeline, make sure you have an In and Ou<span>t selected</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">Q</strong> to connect the sele<span>cted clip:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer273" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_7.32_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 7.32: After connecting, the region selected on the timeline defines the duration of the source clip "/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.32: After connecting, the region selected on the timeline defines the duration of the so<span>urce clip </span></p>&#13;
			<p>If the source clip has enough <a id="_idIndexMarker493"/>media to fill the selected region of the timeline, a clip will be connected to just that region. It'll start from the In point you chose in the Browser, and run for the length you chose in the timeline, but the Out point in the Browser (chosen or implied) will be ignored. The Skimmer is also ignored, if present.</p>&#13;
			<p>If you're viewing <strong class="bold">Favorites</strong>, <strong class="bold">Hide Rejected</strong>, or a <strong class="bold">Keyword Collection</strong>, be aware that hidden parts of your source clip might be used if the selected timeline duration needs more content than the visible display currently shows — if more media is available, it will be used. Should the source clip really be too short, you'll be presented with an error, and if you proceed, you'll be given as much media as there is available.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-212"><a id="_idTextAnchor220"/>Backtiming</h2>&#13;
			<p>From time to time, it can be <a id="_idIndexMarker494"/>more important what's at the end of a connected clip rather than the beginning, and there's a solution for that too. Instead of picking an In point in the Browser, press <strong class="bold">O</strong> to pick an Out point. And instead of pressing <strong class="bold">Q</strong> to connect, press <strong class="bold">⇧</strong><strong class="bold">Q</strong> to perform a backtimed connect. This option places the Out point from the Browser clip at the Out point in the <strong class="bold">Timeline</strong>, then uses as much media before that point as the timeline region requires.</p>&#13;
			<p>Both the regular and backtimed three-point edits are useful if you're an editor who likes precision, but if you'd prefer to just throw it in and trim it later, it's up to you.</p>&#13;

			<p>There's one more <a id="_idIndexMarker495"/>feature to look at here. Though it's not prominent, it's one of the two primary methods of editing in traditional non-linear editing apps and the fourth of the four editing buttons: <strong class="bold">Overwrite</strong>, which puts video at a specific point on the Primary Storyline: </p>&#13;

			<p>It's possible to Overwrite with two points on a source clip and a third on the timeline, but it's more common to put two on the timeline, as before:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">In the Browser, skim over a clip you'd like to connect, at a point you'd like to start from, and press <strong class="bold">I</strong> to mark an In point (or <strong class="bold">O</strong> to mark an O<span>ut point).</span></li>&#13;
				<li>On the timeline, skim to a point where you want to add the connected clip, and press <strong class="bold">I</strong> to mark an<span> In point.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Skim to where you want to end the conne<span>cted clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">O</strong> to mark an <span>Out point.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">D</strong> to Overwrite the selected clip, or <strong class="bold">⇧D</strong> to Overwrite with backtiming (from the Out po<span>int back):</span><div id="_idContainer275" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_7.34.2_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div></li>&#13;

			<p>What's different? This isn't a <a id="_idIndexMarker496"/>connection above the Primary Storyline but a replacement of the clips currently on the Primary Storyline. This is not an easily reversible operation, and any clips or regions within the selection will be entirely overwritten. Why do this? Well, I confess that I almost never do. If you want to use the Primary Storyline rather than connecting clips, then I can see the appeal, but I find connecting a clip above does what I want and lets any audio from the primary be heard.</p>&#13;
			<p>One exception: you might want to Overwrite a clip into a connected Storyline. That's possible, but you'll have to select the Storyline (not a clip within the Storyline) before you press <strong class="bold">D</strong> or <strong class="bold">⇧D</strong>. Again, that's not something I usually do, as I prefer to Replace — but that's coming up in the next chapter. Lastly, let's clarify copy and paste.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-214"><a id="_idTextAnchor222"/>Copy and paste</h2>&#13;
			<p>Copy and paste are key operations <a id="_idIndexMarker497"/>in many applications, and while they're here too, connections can complicate matters just a little. If you copy a connected clip, it'll stay connected when you paste it, which makes sense. And if you copy a Primary Storyline clip, it'll paste to the Primary Storyline, performing an Insert operation and potentially breaking up a clip under the Skimmer. All of that makes sense.</p>&#13;
			<p>If, however, you want to copy from the Primary Storyline and then paste as a connected clip, you'll need to use <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Paste as Connected Clip</strong> (<strong class="bold">⌥V</strong>) instead of a regular paste. There's no complementary operation to "paste as primary" but it's easy to do a regular paste and then drag it into the Primary Storyline if that's what you want.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-215"><a id="_idTextAnchor223"/>Review — three-point editing and more</h2>&#13;
			<p>You've learned how to perform a few <a id="_idIndexMarker498"/>more traditional edits in this more modern timeline, and some of them are just as useful now as they have been for decades, even if you might not overwrite as often as an editor from 10 years ago. Defining the part of the timeline where a clip should go is a perfectly sensible way to work, and backtiming is a great answer when the end of a clip is more important than the start. Copy and paste flexibility is also important for that time when you need to connect a clip that was once part of the Primary Storyline.</p>&#13;
			<p>It's possible to ignore these commands and just nudge and trim everything into place, but you'll get a certain satisfaction from a clip that just slots perfectly into place. Do explore these operations and see whether they work for you, and if not — no problem.</p>&#13;
			<p>Let's wrap it all up.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-216"><a id="_idTextAnchor224"/>Summary</h1>&#13;
			<p>While some of the concepts in this chapter are simple, others are a little on the tricky side. I've long said that "a good user interface makes simple things easy and hard things possible," and the unfortunate side-effect of connecting clips to other clips is that can add complexity.</p>&#13;
			<p>While it's true that the same complexity isn't present in a track-based editing paradigm, connections allow you to move a single clip in the Primary Storyline, move its connections automatically, and be sure that all other connected clips will stay connected to their parents too. The unique parent-child connection here means that a connected clip always belongs to a parent, but that parent isn't dragged around if its child moves. It's not a locked group with both clips in charge; the primary clip is always the spine of the story.</p>&#13;
			<p>Without connections, the lack of parent-child clip-to-clip linking means that it can be easy to lose sync between two items, or for one clip to wipe out another when they end up on the same track at the same time: <em class="italic">Track Tetris</em> is a real issue in most <strong class="bold">Non-Linear Editors</strong> (<strong class="bold">NLEs</strong>). This never happens in FCP X, and if the trade-off is a little complexity around connections, I'm happy to take it.</p>&#13;
			<p>In <a href="B15343_10_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor271"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">Explore a Little: Compound Clips and Timeline Tricks</em>, I'll show you a few more ways to boss around the Magnetic Timeline, but you won't need them yet. Keep the spine of the story on the Primary Storyline with any cutaways connected above, use Storylines for a sequence of cutaways, and connect any background music in a Storyline below. If something goes weird, <strong class="bold">⌘Z</strong> it away, and drag and drop will save the day.</p>&#13;
			<p>Rearranging, trimming, and covering up clips will take you a long way, but a few extra tools will make things much easier. Next up, because this isn't iMovie, it's time to explore some of the more advanced trimming options.</p>&#13;
