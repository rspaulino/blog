			<p class="author-quote">"Has Final Cut Pro X made me a better editor? Undoubtedly. I have the freedom to experiment with just a few clicks, move things around and everything stays in sync, go through all the 'could we <span>just...', </span>&#13;
the 'what happens if we…' and the 'what would be really nice is... And those are the processes that turn an average production into a great pr<span>oduction."</span></p>&#13;
			<p class="author-quote-source">— Peter Wiggins, experienced broadcast editor, motion graphics artist, and editor of <a href="http://FCP.co">FCP.co</a></p>&#13;
			<p>At this point, if you've been working along with the book, you should have your edit mostly complete. This third part of the book will show you how to add all the finishing touches: changes to color, to video effects, transitions, audio effects, and then titles and captions. While it's entirely possible to fix color or sound earlier in the process, or indeed to make final editing changes very late in the process, you'll find the suggested order here quite helpful in most jobs.</p>&#13;
			<p>This detailed chapter explores the color workflow from top to bottom. You'll learn all about Video Scopes, comparison tools, the variety of automatic corrections available, and how to perform your own primary corrections to white balance, exposure, and saturation. Once you've mastered primary corrections, you'll learn all about different methods for controlling contrast and ways to control color selectively, drawing attention to parts of the image and adding the final touches that the cinematographer (or you) couldn't achieve in camera. Finally, a selection of more advanced techniques is discussed, including obvious and hidden ways to duplicate color corrections, and how to install and use Adjustment Layers. This is a monster, but don't skip it. Specifically, you'll find out all about the following topics:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Understanding the colo<span>r workflow</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Correcting white balance, exposure, and <span>saturation</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Finessing contras<span>t and more</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Selective c<span>orrections</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Advanced color <span>techniques</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Many editors don't know enough about color correction, and that's a real shame. As jobs broaden in their scope, every editor should know at least a little about &#13;
color because it's really not hard, and no shot is perfect straight out of the camera. Even if you're on a large production with a dedicated colorist involved, there's no harm in doing at least part of the job yourself, and FCP X does provide a suite of professional-grade tools. The best place to start is with an overview of the workflow.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-286"><a id="_idTextAnchor297"/>Understanding the color workflow</h1>&#13;
			<p>Though there are<a id="_idIndexMarker691"/> many ways to approach color correction, the goal is always the same: to make the image look better. At the very least, you'll want all your shots to match, to look like they belong together. Your subjects shouldn't bounce around between light and dark, or between yellow and orange; it's distracting and unappealing:</p>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.1: Ideally, the Leaning Tower of Pisa shouldn't look dark in one shot, then bright i<span>n the next</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Getting the basics of <a id="_idIndexMarker692"/>exposure, saturation, and white balance sorted is usually called <strong class="bold">primary color correction</strong>. To make those first basic fixes, you might start out with an automatic adjustment like <strong class="bold">Balance Color</strong> or <strong class="bold">Match Color</strong>, before adding several manual adjustments such as the <strong class="bold">Color Board</strong> and/or <strong class="bold">Col</strong><strong class="bold">or Wheels</strong>.</p>&#13;
			<p>To take it further, <strong class="bold">secondary color correction</strong> is all about being selective, making changes to just parts of the image. You might brighten up someone's face, finesse contrast in a more subtle way, boost the saturation of an object, or darken down the corners of the frame. These selective adjustments can be made with a built-in feature called <strong class="bold">masks</strong>, but the <strong class="bold">Color Curves</strong> and <strong class="bold">Hue/Saturation Curves</strong> tools can also be used selectively.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">The terms <em class="italic">color grading</em> and <em class="italic">color correction</em> are sometimes used interchangeably, but most often, mechanical changes to make an image look natural are considered "correction," while aesthetic or atmospheric changes are considered "grading." Many secondary color corrections and some primary color corrections could be seen as color grading, but the line between correction and grading can be hard to put your finger on. Don't worry about where that line falls, but do try to make your image look natural before you make it more emotive.</p>&#13;
			<p>Before diving any deeper, let's make sure we're working in the right way, with the right parts of the user <a id="_idIndexMarker693"/>interface on show.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-287"><a id="_idTextAnchor298"/>Preparing for color correction</h2>&#13;
			<p>Several new <a id="_idIndexMarker694"/>interface panes will be important during a<a id="_idIndexMarker695"/> color correction pass, and they can all be toggled on or off with dedicated shortcut keys. Here are just two for now:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Video Scopes</strong> (<strong class="bold">⌘</strong><strong class="bold">7</strong>, also in the <strong class="bold">View</strong> menu in t<span>he Viewer)</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Insp</strong><span><strong class="bold">ector</strong></span><span> (</span><span><strong class="bold">⌘4</strong></span><span>)</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Most interface panes can be found in the <strong class="bold">Window</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Show in Workspace</strong> menu, and you can show or hide any of them independently:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer428" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_11.2_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.2: Find this submenu in Window &gt; Show in Workspace; checked mea<span>ns visible</span></p>&#13;
			<p>An option there, the <strong class="bold">Event Viewer</strong> (<strong class="bold">⌃⌘3</strong>), brings up an additional Viewer window that's dedicated to source clips from the Browser, leaving the regular Viewer for the Timeline. If you're new to editing, you probably don't need this, but if you've gotten used to a dual-Viewer workflow from other applications, feel free to use it while editing — though we won't need it right now.</p>&#13;
			<p>That's because if you've been following this book's recommended workflow, you probably won't be adding many new clips at this point, and so you don't need to see the Browser (<strong class="bold">⌃⌘1</strong>) any more. Handily, you can quickly switch to a new <strong class="bold">Workspace</strong> that sets up everything you need, like this:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer429" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_11.3_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.3: Find this submenu in Window &gt; Workspaces; the Audio Workspace will be created in the ne<span>xt chapter</span></p>&#13;
			<p>There are a few<a id="_idIndexMarker696"/> useful defaults here, and you can <a id="_idIndexMarker697"/>switch between them any time you're switching between editing tasks. They are:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Default</strong> (<strong class="bold">⌘0</strong>) — including the Browser, Timeline, and Inspector for general-pur<span>pose tasks</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Organize</strong> (<strong class="bold">⌃⇧1</strong>) — hiding the Timeline when you don<span>'t need it</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Color &amp; Effects</strong> <strong class="bold">(⌃⇧2</strong>) — hiding the Browser, showing the four-up Video Scopes a<span>nd Effects</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Dual Displays</strong> (<strong class="bold">⌃⇧3</strong>) — like <strong class="bold">Default</strong>, but with the Browser moved to a sec<span>ond screen</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>When you've checked out a few of these, reset the interface for color work:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">Window</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Workspaces</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Color &amp; Effects</strong> or press <strong class="bold">⌃⇧2</strong>, to <span>show this:</span></li>&#13;

			<p>With <a id="_idIndexMarker698"/>the <strong class="bold">Video Scopes</strong> active, you're now <a id="_idIndexMarker699"/>ready to look around.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-288"><a id="_idTextAnchor299"/>Understanding Video Scopes</h2>&#13;
			<p>The displays <a id="_idIndexMarker700"/>here <a id="_idIndexMarker701"/>each show a different representation of the image, to allow you to make objective judgments about it:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer431" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_11.5_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.5: The Waveform (top left and bottom right by default) is most inform<span>ative here</span></p>&#13;
			<p>A quick glance at a scope can tell you if an image is too bright or too dark, if visible skin tones are close to accurate, and if a shot is roughly balanced. No matter how your screen is <a id="_idIndexMarker702"/>calibrated or what's in your immediate environment, the <a id="_idIndexMarker703"/>scopes don't lie and should be trusted.</p>&#13;
			<p>To quickly get a handle on how scopes work, activate <strong class="bold">Skimming</strong> (<strong class="bold">S</strong>) if it's not active already, then hover along your Timeline while watching the scopes. The <strong class="bold">traces</strong> are the colored lines and dots that update as you move, and they represent the image's <strong class="bold">Luma</strong> (how bright it is) or another aspect of the image. The Color Workspace defaults to showing four different Video Scopes, as follows:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Histogram</strong>, currently shown in the top-right quadrant with the <strong class="bold">RGB Ov</strong><span><strong class="bold">erlay</strong></span><span> mode</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Vectorscope</strong>, currently shown in the bottom-lef<span>t quadrant</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Waveform</strong>, currently shown twice, in the top left with <strong class="bold">Luma</strong> (brightness) and in the bottom right as an <span><strong class="bold">RGB Parade</strong></span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Each individual scope has a drop-down menu indicated by an icon in its top-right corner. This menu lets you choose which scope is active in that section and which channels it currently shows, as you can see:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer432" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_11.6_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.6: Look for the small graph icon in the corner of ea<span>ch scope; </span>&#13;
this is Wavef<span>orm's menu</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Each type of scope has different options, with the <strong class="bold">Waveform</strong> giving the most flexibility and with <strong class="bold">Vectorscope</strong> offering the least.</p>&#13;
			<p>In the very top<a id="_idIndexMarker704"/> corner of the Video Scopes pane there is a <strong class="bold">View</strong> menu that allows <a id="_idIndexMarker705"/>you to change how many scopes are shown, from one to four, in a variety of layouts:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer433" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_11.7_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.7: This View menu, at the top right of this pane, governs all <span>the scopes</span></p>&#13;
			<p>This same menu also allows you to change the brightness of the traces, and to move between a horizontal layout (with Video Scopes to the left of the Viewer) and a vertical layout (with Video Scopes below the Viewer). For now, we'll stay with the default four-up view and explore each scope type. In the following screenshot, you can see an example of the <strong class="bold">Histogram</strong>:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer434" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_11.8_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.8: This Histogram shows a fairly even spread of data, with a large amount of brig<span>htish blue</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The Histogram will be <a id="_idIndexMarker706"/>familiar to photographers. It's an area graph that shows how<a id="_idIndexMarker707"/> much of an image sits at each value along a horizontal scale, often representing Luma (brightness). That scale shows one or more channels, one of Luma, Red, Green, or Blue, or a combination of the last three drawn <a id="_idIndexMarker708"/>together (RGB Overlay) or separately (RGB Parade). The scale defaults to <strong class="bold">IRE</strong> (from Institute of Radio Engineers), and you can think of it like a percentage scale. For Luma, 0 IRE means black and 100 IRE means white.</p>&#13;
			<p>With the Luma or RGB Overlay displays, if a graph is higher on the left than the right, there are more dark areas. If there's a peak near 50 IRE, a chunk of the image sits around the midtones, the medium-toned areas. And with the RGB Overlay and RGB Parade displays, if part of an image should be neutral gray, then the traces should be at the same spots in the R, G, and B channels. </p>&#13;
			<p>However, the Histogram is purely about the values; it doesn't tell you physically where in the image the data sits. In contrast, the <strong class="bold">Waveform</strong> <em class="italic">does</em>, as you can see:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer435" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_11.9_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.9: This Waveform tells you that the blacks aren't 0%; the sky gets brighter to the right, and the flagstones aren't <span>quite gray</span></p>&#13;
			<p>For most uses, the Waveform is superior because it tells you where that image data is in the image. The Waveform corresponds directly to the image in the Viewer from left to right, and shows the image brightness (or another channel) vertically. While the Histogram might tell you that "most of the image is dark," the Waveform can show you exactly which parts <a id="_idIndexMarker709"/>of the image are light or dark, or the midtones of skin, or the<a id="_idIndexMarker710"/> brighter blues of sky. There's a wider choice of channels available here than with the Histogram: <strong class="bold">RGB Overlay</strong>, <strong class="bold">RGB Parade</strong>, <strong class="bold">Red</strong>, <strong class="bold">Green</strong>, <strong class="bold">Blue</strong>, <strong class="bold">Luma</strong>, <strong class="bold">Chroma</strong>, and the odd <strong class="bold">Y'CbCr Parade</strong> that looks like this:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer436" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_11.10_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.10: The same image as the last as a Y'Cb'Cr Parade; notice the spike in Cr around the<span> red tower</span></p>&#13;
			<p>For most purposes, the Luma or RGB Overlay options are easiest to read, but technicians might find the Y'CbCr Parade informative. Most often, though, those concerned with color and saturation prefer to view that data in a circle rather than a vertical graph.</p>&#13;
			<p>The following screenshot shows an example of the <strong class="bold">Ve</strong><strong class="bold">ctorscope</strong>:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer437" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_11.11_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.11: The Vectorscope only shows color and saturatio<span>n — handy </span>&#13;
with a c<span>olor chart</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The circular Vectorscope is used for judging color, but it doesn't show brightness. The traces reach out from the center of the graph toward a color, indicated by the circle's outline and by six boxes indicating (clockwise from top) Red, Magenta, Blue, Cyan, Green, and Yellow. The further the traces are from the center, the greater their saturation, or vividness. Shoot an image of a color chart as shown, and you can correct it until you see spikes moving exactly toward each named box.</p>&#13;
			<p>As with the Histogram, the image traces display only the amount of data at a particular value and<a id="_idIndexMarker711"/> not their position in the image, so sometimes you'll <a id="_idIndexMarker712"/>have to guess which spike corresponds to someone's face and which spike corresponds to that orange wall behind them. A low-saturation image will have small traces, and any areas of neutral gray should be dead-center in the graph. Here's another example:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer438" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_11.12_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.12: The scope from a shot of the author (who needs a haircut) wearing a blue shirt against a yellow-green-blue <span>background</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The gray line between yellow and red is the <strong class="bold">Skin Tone Indicator</strong>, and all human skin tones sit on or near this line. Options here are more limited; you can increase the scale to <strong class="source-inline">133%</strong> to make the traces a little larger, hide the Skin Tone Indicator if you don't need it, and rotate the graph to another phase, but that's it.</p>&#13;
			<p>The purpose of all these scopes is to inform you while you make color adjustments. If you want a "normal" image, you'll want to put the blacks near 0 IRE and the whites near 100 IRE on the default Luma scale; make sure grays are gray to neutralize any color shifting; put skin tones on or near the Skin Tone Indicator; and make any other creative decisions. If you push the image data too far, below <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> or above <strong class="source-inline">100</strong>, then part of the image will be clipped off<a id="_idIndexMarker713"/> and lost. While you might indeed choose to do that for<a id="_idIndexMarker714"/> creative reasons, it should never happen by accident. Always watch the Video Scopes as you adjust color or brightness, and make sure you don't push things too far.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">For the best color correction experience, you'll need to be working with a high-quality monitor, in a controlled environment, and with a dedicated external monitor — but any Mac's built-in screen will probably do. Higher-end targets will have higher-end requirements, but if you're delivering online, most of your audience will be watching on a phone. Preview the final output on your own iPhone, and you'll have seen what many of them will.</p>&#13;
			<p>Remember: the Video Scopes are always right, even if a screen is a bit bright, a bit dark, or a bit too contrasty. Each display your work will be shown on may be a little different, but what you see here in FCP X should be very similar to what you see in <strong class="bold">QuickTime Player</strong>, and on an iPad or iPhone. Don't worry too much if things appear very slightly different after uploading to an online video service — some variation is unavoidable. Your Apple hardware is color-managed, but not everything else is.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-289"><a id="_idTextAnchor300"/>Understanding Wide Gamut and HDR</h2>&#13;
			<p>The vast<a id="_idIndexMarker715"/> majority <a id="_idIndexMarker716"/>of Projects<a id="_idIndexMarker717"/> today (and<a id="_idIndexMarker718"/> this book!) will use the same standard color space, called <strong class="bold">Rec. 709</strong>, which gives<a id="_idIndexMarker719"/> you a range of legal Luma values between 0 and 100 IRE. However, it's possible to use a wider color space, <strong class="bold">Rec. 2020</strong>, which allows you to extend your image across a wider range of brightness values and colors. This can look better on newer, more capable TVs and monitors, but older devices won't be able to display the extra color and brightness information, and (depending on delivery requirements) you may need to deliver different versions of your Projects for Rec. 709 and Rec. 2020 standards.</p>&#13;
			<p>While we will use the standard Rec. 709 color space for examples here, if you want to try the newer Rec. 2020 space, do the following:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Select<a id="_idIndexMarker720"/> your <strong class="bold">Library</strong> in <a id="_idIndexMarker721"/>th<span>e </span><span><strong class="bold">Browser</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press<a id="_idIndexMarker722"/> the <strong class="bold">Modify</strong> button<a id="_idIndexMarker723"/> in the <span><strong class="bold">Inspector</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Switch to <strong class="bold">Wide Gamut HDR</strong> and click <span>on </span><span><strong class="bold">Change</strong></span><span>:</span><div id="_idContainer439" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_11.13_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.13: To try HDR, switch the Library first, then the <span>Project(s)</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Select a <strong class="bold">Project</strong> that you want to switch to <span>Rec. 2020.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Click the <strong class="bold">Modify</strong> button in the <span><strong class="bold">Inspector</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Color Space</strong> menu, choose <strong class="bold">Wide Gamut HDR – Rec. 2020 PQ</strong> and<span> click </span><span><strong class="bold">OK</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>Of the color space options, all the <strong class="bold">Wide Gamut</strong> options include a wider range of colors, and <strong class="bold">HDR</strong> (<strong class="bold">High Dynamic Range</strong>) also enables a wider range of brightness values.</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer440" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_11.14_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.14: If you want to use HDR, this is a decent plac<span>e to start</span></p>&#13;
			<p>HDR standards include many ways to represent an increased brightness range, and two are supported here. <strong class="bold">PQ</strong> (<strong class="bold">Perceptual Quantizer</strong>) and <strong class="bold">HLG</strong> (<strong class="bold">Hybrid Log Gamma</strong>) are available, but <strong class="bold">PQ</strong> is used more widely. If you decide to use <strong class="bold">Wide Gamut HDR</strong>, you'll find that brightness is no longer capped at 100 IRE but can go much higher, depending on the <a id="_idIndexMarker724"/>standard<a id="_idIndexMarker725"/> you choose to work with. The color <a id="_idIndexMarker726"/>correction <a id="_idIndexMarker727"/>tools covered here will work slightly differently too.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">In a video context, HDR means extending the brightest possible value to one that goes beyond normal values. It shouldn't be confused with photograph-style HDR, in which multiple photographs are combined to compress a wide range of brightness values into a smaller space.</p>&#13;
			<p>Wide Gamut and HDR are going to become more important, but right now, they are largely used by more expensive productions. Standards here are still shifting, and if you need to deliver to a service that requests HDR data, make sure you understand exactly what they need before you begin. Having to correct everything twice is a serious downside of some Wide Gamut HDR workflows, and <em class="italic">for your first few Projects at least, you should stay with Rec. 709</em>. If you switched your Project and/or Library to Wide Gamut + HDR, switch it back to Rec. 709 to follow along.</p>&#13;
			<p>Before we jump into corrections, let's quickly recap on a few important aspects of selections in the timeline.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-290"><a id="_idTextAnchor301"/>Understanding timeline selection subtleties</h2>&#13;
			<p>While the Skimmer<a id="_idIndexMarker728"/> is amazing for quickly inspecting<a id="_idIndexMarker729"/> clips, there are a couple of subtle points you should be aware of to avoid confusion:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer441" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_11.15_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.15: Clip Skimming is on by default, but can b<span>e disabled</span></p>&#13;
			<p>First, know that there's an option called <strong class="bold">Clip Skimming</strong> in the <strong class="bold">View</strong> menu, on by default, which affects what you see as you skim. When on, it shows the exact clip the cursor is over rather than the clip at the top of the stack in the timeline. This is usually fine, but if you prefer to always see the final composite image, turn this off. Note that you can always skim above the clips in the timeline to see the final composite image anyway.</p>&#13;
			<p>Second, the Skimmer is great for viewing, but not so good for making adjustments. As it disappears when the cursor leaves the Timeline, you'll have to click to place the Playhead if you want to make any adjustments in the Inspector:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer442" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_11.16_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.16: If there's no selection, a white dot indicates the clip that will b<span>e affected</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Third, selections are really important. If you don't select a clip at all, you'll see a small white dot on the highest clip underneath the Playhead, and that's the clip you'll be adjusting in the Inspector. In a simple timeline this is fine, but as timelines grow into multilayered monsters, you'll want to select a clip explicitly, to define which clip you're adjusting. But don't just click on a clip to select it! Instead, my strong recommendation is:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><em class="italic">Always ⌥-click on the clip you want to adjust in the </em><span><em class="italic">Inspector</em></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Why is this so<a id="_idIndexMarker730"/> important? Because if you select a clip <a id="_idIndexMarker731"/>simply by clicking on it, the Playhead stays where it is, meaning that you could be looking at a different clip while you adjust the selected clip in the Inspector! Here's an illustration:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer443" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_11.17_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.17: The yellow clip is selected, but the Playhead is on the previous clip, and the Playhead controls what you see in the Viewer while working in the<span> Inspector</span></p>&#13;
			<p>It's rare that you'd want to work on a clip that you're not looking at, so remember &#13;
the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>To move the Playhead and select the clip, always <strong class="bold">⌥-click</strong> the clip, for thi<span>s result: </span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer444" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_11.18_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.18: If you ⌥-click, you'll always see the selection and the Playhead in the <span>same place</span></p>&#13;
			<p>If you're a big keyboard fan, there are a couple of shortcut keys that will help:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">C</strong> usually selects the Primary Storyline clip under the Playhead or Skimmer (however, if the Skimmer is absent and no clip is selected, a connected clip under the Playhead may be <span>selected).</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">⌘↑</strong> selects the clip above the cur<span>rent clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">⌘↓</strong> selects<a id="_idIndexMarker732"/> the clip below the cur<span>rent</span><span><a id="_idIndexMarker733"/></span><span> clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">⌘←</strong> selects the previous clip in the <span>same role.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">⌘→</strong> selects the previous clip in the <span>same role.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>With these keys, it's possible to jump swiftly between different clips without the mouse. Also, if you'd like to correct B-roll and A-roll clips independently, you could have an easier time of it by assigning a special Role to B-roll clips, and then jumping through all the clips you've used in a timeline.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-291"><a id="_idTextAnchor302"/>Review — Understanding the color workflow</h2>&#13;
			<p>You've got this! With<a id="_idIndexMarker734"/> the Video Scopes up in a dedicated Workspace, an understanding of what they all mean, and a firm grip of how to select things, you're ready. From this point onward, and for the next four chapters, you'll need to <strong class="bold">⌥-click</strong> frequently, to specify the clip you want to adjust in the Inspector. Let's do it, starting with the basics.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-292"><a id="_idTextAnchor303"/>Correcting white balance, exposure, and saturation</h1>&#13;
			<p>Before you <a id="_idIndexMarker735"/>can<a id="_idIndexMarker736"/> get creative you have to normalize, and<a id="_idIndexMarker737"/> that's what this section is all about. Fixing any issues with white balance, exposure, and saturation is the first step in basic correction, and you've got options. There are several ways to approach this, and there's no right or wrong way. But here's a rough guide to your options, for each clip in your timeline:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Balance Color</strong> to automatically correct brightness and white balance. This sometimes works well, but the fully automatic option often fails, either going too far or being fooled by the image content. There is a manual override, but no way to turn it down; this is o<span>n, or off.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Match Color</strong> to make one clip look like another. This can work well when two shots have very similar content, but otherwise it's not ve<span>ry useful.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Color Board</strong> to adjust the exposure, saturation, and color of different parts of the image, adjusting the shadows, midtones, highlights, or the whole image. There's a lot of control here and it's pretty quick, but it's a manua<span>l process.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Color Wheels</strong> to adjust the exposure, saturation, and color of different parts of the image, as well as the overall color temperature, tint, and hue. This is more compact than the Color Board, and though it has a few other differences, it does essentially the<span> same job.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>All of these corrections are best used with the Video Scopes active so you can see what's happening. First, the automatic options.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-293"><a id="_idTextAnchor304"/>Using Balance Color and Match Color</h2>&#13;
			<p>These automatic<a id="_idIndexMarker738"/> options<a id="_idIndexMarker739"/> are found in the second menu of three to the lower left of the Viewer/Video Scopes area:</p>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption"> </p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer445" class="figure">&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.19: The second "magic" menu is what you<span> want here</span></p>&#13;
			<p>It's called the <strong class="bold">Enhancements</strong> menu, and its icon is a small magic wand. To apply <strong class="bold">Bala</strong><strong class="bold">nce Color</strong>:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">⌥-click</strong> on a clip to select it and move the Playhead to t<span>hat point.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">Balance Color</strong> or press <strong class="bold">⌥⌘B</strong>. Here's a before/after ill<span>ustration:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer446" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_11.20_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.20: Before on the left (shot with incorrect white balance) and after on the right, on<span> Automatic</span></p>&#13;
			<p>You'll see the<a id="_idIndexMarker740"/> clip<a id="_idIndexMarker741"/> change color, but the degree of change will vary from clip to clip. Essentially, it tries to make the image look "normal", so a shot with a variety of content in different colors and some grays and blacks will look much the same or a bit better. If there are large areas of color in shot, the colors could be shifted wrongly:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer447" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_11.21_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.21: This overexposed shot with limited colors has exposure <span>improved, </span>&#13;
but colors tin<span>ted yellow</span></p>&#13;
			<p>It's not just colors that shift; it's contrast too. Balance Color tries to make sure that the shadows are at 0 IRE and the highlights are at 100 IRE. The auto-exposure features in many<a id="_idIndexMarker742"/> cameras will do this anyway, but shots that are especially bright or dark <a id="_idIndexMarker743"/>might change quite drastically.</p>&#13;
			<p>To override a Balance Color that's gone wrong, you'll need something in your shot that's gray. Any gray will do, but overexposed white or underexposed black won't work. The process:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">In the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong>, select the first t<span>ab, </span><span><strong class="bold">Video</strong></span><span>.</span><p>Almost all the color correction tools use the second tab, <strong class="bold">Color</strong>, but these first automatic adjustments are only found in the <strong class="bold">Video</strong> tab.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Change <strong class="bold">Method</strong> from <strong class="bold">Automatic</strong> to <strong class="bold">Whit</strong><span><strong class="bold">e Balance</strong></span><span>.</span><p>You'll see that a small blue eyedropper icon becomes active in the Inspector, and that an onscreen instruction and a cursor-based eyedropper appear in the Viewer.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Viewer</strong>, click (or click and drag) over part of the image that is gray, or nea<span>rly white.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>The area you click or drag on will be shifted to neutral gray, and if the image had a tint toward orange, or green, or yellow, it should now be gone:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer448" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_11.22_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.22: Dragging over white or gray areas will define <span>a new gray</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Clicking designates <a id="_idIndexMarker744"/>a single pixel, while dragging to create a small circle uses the <a id="_idIndexMarker745"/>average color of the area within the circle. The result:</p>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.23: Now with improved exposure and no yellow tinting — but n<span>ot perfect</span></p>&#13;
			<p>You can click or drag as many times as you want to get a slightly different result, but you'll need a neutral area in frame. This is just one reason why it can be useful to record a brief shot of a gray card or color chart — it's a guaranteed neutral source. Later in this chapter, you'll learn how to copy a Balance Color correction from one clip and paste it onto others, so you don't need to film a color chart in every shot.</p>&#13;
			<p>The eyedropper and its onscreen instruction will stay active as long as the eyedropper icon to the right of the Method menu is toggled on (in blue) and the Balance Color effect is selected. Any video or color effects with onscreen controls can only show those controls while the effect is selected, and this is indicated by a yellow outline around the effect in the Inspector:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

uncheck the effect to t<span>urn it off</span></p>&#13;
			<p>As mentioned<a id="_idIndexMarker746"/> earlier, there's no way to turn the Balance Color correction<a id="_idIndexMarker747"/> down, but if you want to turn it (or any effect) off, just click on the blue checkbox to the left of its name, or even uncheck the box next to Effects. Unchecked effects are disabled and can be re-enabled with another click. If you don't like an effect and want to remove it entirely, select the effect in the Inspector by clicking on it, then press <strong class="bold">delete</strong>.</p>&#13;
			<p>It's also worth trying <strong class="bold">Match Color</strong>, as follows:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">⌥-click</strong> on a clip to select it and move the Playhead to t<span>hat point.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">Match Color</strong> or <span>press </span><span><strong class="bold">⌥⌘M</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Click on a frame within a different clip in the timeline, one that has colors you want t<span>o imitate.</span><p>This clip should have similar content to the clip you want to change, unless you're trying to create a strong tinted effect. Here's what you'll see:</p><div id="_idContainer451" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_11.25_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.25: Matching the second clip to the first will produce very stro<span>ng results</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Click again, on another frame within the same clip, or another clip<span> entirely.</span><p>Note that Browser clips can be used as a color source, but not while the Browser is hidden.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>To approve the change, click the <strong class="bold">Apply Match</strong> button in the bottom-right corner of <a id="_idIndexMarker748"/>the <strong class="bold">Viewer</strong>, or press <strong class="bold">Cancel</strong> if you don't like th<span>e </span><span><a id="_idIndexMarker749"/></span><span>results.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;

			<p>To revisit this effect in the future, you can press the <strong class="bold">Choose</strong> button in the Inspector to try again, turn it off, or delete it. Personally, I haven't had much luck with this feature, but I've found that Balance Color can get to a good starting point quite quickly. Most of the time, I'll<a id="_idIndexMarker750"/> try Balance Color, and if it looks good, I'll leave it on. Either <a id="_idIndexMarker751"/>way, I'll nearly always make some changes with the Color Board.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-294"><a id="_idTextAnchor305"/>Adjusting Exposure with the Color Board</h2>&#13;
			<p>Even though <a id="_idIndexMarker752"/>most cameras perform some kind of automatic<a id="_idIndexMarker753"/> correction to keep the image within "normal" bounds, you'll often want to make an image at least a little brighter or darker. To get started, first make sure that the Color Board is your default, as follows:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Choose <strong class="bold">Final Cut Pro</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Preferences</strong>, the<span>n </span><span><strong class="bold">General</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>From the <strong class="bold">Color Correction</strong> menu, choose <strong class="bold">Co</strong><span><strong class="bold">lor Board</strong></span><span>:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer453" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_11.27_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.27: Choose the Color Board for now, and maybe switch to Color Wh<span>eels later</span></p>&#13;
			<p>It's likely that you'll prefer the Color Board or Color Wheels for your default correction, so let's start simply. You'll perform these steps every time you want to add a correction to a clip:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">⌥-click</strong> on a clip to select it and move the Playhead to t<span>hat point.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">⌘6</strong> to add the default color correction to <span>this clip.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>The Inspector now opens to the <strong class="bold">Color</strong> tab. Technically, a Color Board instance isn't added to the clip until you change one of the controls here. So, what are you looking at?</p>&#13;
			<p>There are three tabs (<strong class="bold">Color</strong>, <strong class="bold">Saturation</strong>, <strong class="bold">Exposure</strong>) along the top of the interface, and you'll usually attack them in reverse order, from right to left. Click on <strong class="bold">Exposure</strong> to begin. The four pucks here can be moved up and down to make part of the image brighter or darker, and the four areas are:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Master</strong> — the w<span>hole image</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Shadows</strong> — adjust the darkest areas of the image and lock the <span>highlights</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Midtones</strong> — adjust the middle areas of the image while locking the highlights a<span>nd shadows</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Highlights</strong> — adjust the lightest areas of the image while locking t<span>he shadows</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>As well as the <a id="_idIndexMarker754"/>pucks, if your screen is tall enough, you'll see<a id="_idIndexMarker755"/> the same information in number form below those pucks:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer454" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_11.28_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.28: With the Exposure board slight<span>ly tweaked</span></p>&#13;
			<p>You can drag directly <a id="_idIndexMarker756"/>on the numbers (up and down, or left <a id="_idIndexMarker757"/>and right) to change them if you'd prefer, and if you do drag on the numbers, you can hold <strong class="bold">⇧</strong> to change more quickly or <strong class="bold">⌥</strong> to change more<a id="_idIndexMarker758"/> slowly. There's also a <strong class="bold">hooked arrow</strong> at the top right (highlighted in the image) that will reset all settings if pressed. Press it if you mess up.</p>&#13;
			<p>Each of these controls affects a wide part of the image; it's not like with photo-editing software, where "highlights" means only the brightest parts. Pushing the highlights puck adjusts the highlights more than the shadows, but the whole image will shift to some degree. In the following screenshot, you can see that the highlights are already at 100, and increasing highlights would discard that highlight detail:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer455" class="figure">&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.29: Here's a fresh image without correction — highlights are already clipped, but shadows a<span>ren't at 0</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The kind of adjustment you'll make depends on what's wrong with the image, and you're probably <a id="_idIndexMarker759"/>going for "normal", at least at first. Here's one <a id="_idIndexMarker760"/>workflow, watching the <strong class="bold">Luma Waveform</strong> in the top left:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Push <strong class="bold">Master</strong> or <strong class="bold">Shadows</strong> (not both) up or down until the darkest part of the traces touc<span>hes 0 IRE.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Push <strong class="bold">Highlights</strong> up or down until the brightest part of the traces touche<span>s 100 IRE.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Push <strong class="bold">Midtones</strong> up or down until it lo<span>oks right.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Adjust <strong class="bold">Highlights</strong> and <strong class="bold">Midtones</strong> repeatedly until the image is balanced, with the brightest traces touching or nea<span>r 100 IRE.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>Choosing to push Master or Shadows in that first step will give you different results, and you'll want to try it both ways.</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer456" class="figure">&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.30: Moving Shadows and Midtones (not the already blown Highlights) gives a be<span>tter image</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The goal with these steps is to create a balanced image that covers the full tonal range from black to white. However, not every image contains the full dynamic range available, so these steps won't work with every image, and you'll have to use &#13;
your judgment.</p>&#13;
			<p>You'll also find that if your camera was on automatic settings, you'll already have shadows near 0 IRE and highlights near 100 IRE. In that case, you'll skip <em class="italic">Step 1</em>, and that's OK. But don't<a id="_idIndexMarker761"/> try to do everything here. The Color Board and/or Color Wheels are<a id="_idIndexMarker762"/> a useful initial adjustment, but they're not the best way to create contrast. </p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer457" class="figure">&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.31: This image has been pushed too far beyond the 0–100<span> IRE range</span></p>&#13;
			<p>If you push the shadows lower than 0 IRE, that's called "crushing the blacks", and while it does increase contrast, it also destroys shadow detail. Lifting the highlights (past 100 IRE) similarly loses highlight detail. At this stage, try not to do either; just watch the Waveform scope to make sure your images use the full dynamic range, and move on to the next step.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-295"><a id="_idTextAnchor306"/>Adjusting Saturation with the Color Board</h2>&#13;
			<p>After Exposure, you<a id="_idIndexMarker763"/> might <a id="_idIndexMarker764"/>need to tweak <strong class="bold">S</strong><strong class="bold">aturation</strong>:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Click on the <strong class="bold">Saturation</strong> tab at the top of the <strong class="bold">Co</strong><span><strong class="bold">lor Board</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Move the <strong class="bold">Midtones</strong> slider up (or perhaps down) until it l<span>ooks good.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Optionally, move the <strong class="bold">Shadows</strong> slider up (or perhaps down) until it l<span>ooks good.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>If a shot starts out life underexposed or overexposed, it's likely to be undersaturated. Some footage is also slightly undersaturated by nature, but if the image looks very flat then it might have been shot in "log" mode, and you'll find out how to deal with that later in this chapter.</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

or in Waveform set<span> to Chroma</span></p>&#13;
			<p>For now, if any parts of the image look unexciting and dull, boost Saturation. Midtones is most likely to need work (as it's the puck you probably changed the most under Exposure), but Shadows can look good boosted too. Boosting Highlights usually looks a little unnatural, and you might want to reduce highlight saturation slightly. While you can watch Saturation change in the Vectorscope, there's no hard and fast rule here — stop when it looks good. Subtle changes to Saturation are important in some looks, but other tools will give you more control. If you need to, you can revisit Saturation after <a id="_idIndexMarker765"/>the next section: changing white <a id="_idIndexMarker766"/>balance with the <strong class="bold">Color</strong> area.<a id="_idTextAnchor307"/>Adjusting white balance with the Color Board</p>&#13;
			<p>With Exposure fixed <a id="_idIndexMarker767"/>and Saturation slightly<a id="_idIndexMarker768"/> tweaked, you'll want to fix any remaining white balance issues. No matter how careful the camera operator is, you'll almost certainly have to fix a yellow, green, blue, or orange tint at some point. Most footage can be adjusted at least a little, but high-quality recording formats allow for more extreme adjustments. Fixing color is slightly trickier than the other adjustments, because you have more freedom. To start:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Click on the <strong class="bold">Color</strong> tab at the top of the <strong class="bold">Co</strong><span><strong class="bold">lor Board</strong></span><span>.</span><p>You'll see four pucks, which can be moved horizontally to choose a color, and vertically to define the strength of the movement. Colors have opposites, and moving the puck toward red is exactly the same as moving it away from cyan. You can ignore the lower half of the board for now if you like.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Move the <strong class="bold">Highlights</strong> puck up and along to move the image toward a particular color, or down and along to move the image away from that color, <span>like this:</span><div id="_idContainer459" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_11.33_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.33: The original shot was clearly too cool, and now that the RGB Parade traces look more similar around the midtones, it's mo<span>re neutral</span></p><p>What's the goal? If there's a white or gray area that looks like it has a color cast, watch the Waveform's RGB Parade (or RGB Overlay) as you move the pucks around. The traces should line up at <a id="_idIndexMarker769"/>the same height in any true grays or<a id="_idIndexMarker770"/> near-whites, and in general, correcting for white balance will nearly always make an image look right. Judge that with the Video Scopes, not your eyes — line up the R, G, and B traces by moving that Highlights puck around.</p><p>Watching a Vectorscope can also be useful here. If there's a person in shot, you can try to line up the traces representing their skin near the skin-tone line.</p><div id="_idContainer460" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_11.34_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.34: Skin tone too warm, versus skin tone about right — just check the V<span>ectorscope</span></p><p>Push that Highlights puck around, keeping an eye on the Vectorscope for skin tone while keeping the <a id="_idIndexMarker771"/>Waveform's R/G/B traces in line for<a id="_idIndexMarker772"/> white or gray areas. It's a balance, and you'll get better with practice.</p><p>Sometimes, if the recorded image has a stronger color cast, you'll also have to move the Midtones, which will affect skin tone more strongly than white balance.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Optionally, also move the <strong class="bold">Midtones</strong> puck up to move the image toward a particular color, or down to move the image away from t<span>hat color.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>Most cameras always record neutral blacks, and the Vectorscope can confirm this by showing traces in the center of its graph. Therefore, moving the Master or Shadows pucks here is more likely to create problems rather than solve them. Still, if the shot has a strong color cast (and Balance Color can't help), you might have to drag the Master color puck (or all of them!) to re-center the data in the Vectorscope. As you can see, it can get messy:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer461" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_11.35_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.35: Correcting this white balance error manually requires complex puck movements to line up the traces on the left-side white/gray/<span>black bars</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Adjust <strong class="bold">Exposure</strong>, then <strong class="bold">Saturation</strong>, then <strong class="bold">Color</strong>. When balancing most shots, that's all you need to do, but if you've had to move the color pucks more than a little, take another look at the Exposure tab and see if you've lost any significant data. There's no problem bouncing between the tabs to push things a little one way or the other.</p>&#13;
			<p>Down the <a id="_idIndexMarker773"/>track, if you decide to push a look a little further, you <a id="_idIndexMarker774"/>might push Shadows in one direction and Highlights in the opposite direction, to create an extreme "color contrast" effect. More on that fun stuff later, though. Time to explore <strong class="bold">Color Wheels</strong>, which you can use as an alternative to the Color Board.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-296"><a id="_idTextAnchor308"/>Using Color Wheels</h2>&#13;
			<p>You can use<a id="_idIndexMarker775"/> the Color Wheels instead of the Color Board, or use both together. All the same principles and approaches from the Color Board apply to Color Wheels, but there are a few additional controls that are important, and some subtle differences too. Let's begin with some familiar steps:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">⌥-click</strong> on a clip (with no corrections applied) to select it and move the Playhead to t<span>hat point.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">⌘6</strong> to add the default color correction to <span>this clip.</span><p>For now, that's going to show the Color Board, but we can change that. At the top of the Color Board, you'll see it says <strong class="bold">No Corrections</strong>, and if you were to make any adjustment now, it would show <strong class="bold">Color Board 1</strong> instead. We'll switch it for something else:</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Click on <strong class="bold">No Corrections</strong> and choose <strong class="bold">+Color Wheels</strong> from the menu,<span> as shown:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer462" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_11.36_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.36: Add a new c<span>olor wheel</span></p>&#13;
			<p>At any point, no matter if a correction has been added to a clip or not, you can add a new correction on top <a id="_idIndexMarker776"/>of any existing ones by choosing an option from this menu starting with <strong class="bold">+</strong>. You can also access existing corrections on this clip from the top half of the same menu.</p>&#13;
			<p>Let's take a look at Color Wheels in more detail:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Master</strong>, <strong class="bold">Shadows</strong>, <strong class="bold">Midtones</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Highlights</strong> wheels correspond to the four pucks found in the three tabs of the Co<span>lor Board.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Each wheel incorporates an <strong class="bold">Exposure</strong> slider on the right, a <strong class="bold">Saturation</strong> slider on the left, and a <strong class="bold">Color </strong>puck in the center. Each wheel also incorporates a hooked arrow reset button to its low<span>er right. </span></li>&#13;
				<li>These controls are duplicated in slider and numeric form in named sections near the bottom of the panel. Press <strong class="bold">Show</strong> to expand each one, and <strong class="bold">Hide</strong> to co<span>ntract it.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Below the wheels, <strong class="bold">Temperature</strong> and <strong class="bold">Tint</strong> sliders offer another way to adjust whit<span>e balance.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>A <strong class="bold">Hue</strong> wheel enables more drastic color shifts by transforming colors around the spectrum, rather than pushing all colors toward a sing<span>le target.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>At the very bottom, a <strong class="bold">Mix</strong> control allows all controls to be gradually tu<span>rned off. </span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>This is what it looks like:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer463" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_11.37_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.37: The Color Wheels correction with a few twea<span>ks applied</span></p>&#13;
			<p>If you decide to <a id="_idIndexMarker777"/>use Color Wheels rather than the Color Board, you'll find that you won't spend as much time switching the interface around, but you may miss the precision of the more prominent numbers. Personally, I prefer using the Color Board for minor white balance fixes because I find it more predictable and consistent, but others will enjoy using the wheels instead. Any choice here is fine.</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer464" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_11.38_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.38: The before/after difference of that last correction, now a bi<span>t punchier</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The additional <strong class="bold">Temperature</strong> and <strong class="bold">Tint</strong> sliders are common in a photography workflow, and if you've transitioned to <a id="_idIndexMarker778"/>editing from that field (or your client uses terms such as "warm" and "cool"), then you might like to use them here. You can see them just below the wheels here:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer465" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_11.39_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.39: The Temperature and Tint sliders are enough to strongly warm up <span>this image</span></p>&#13;
			<p>If you're unfamiliar with them, Temperature is essentially a cyan-yellow (cool to warm) slider, while Tint is a green-magenta slider. If you've worked with the <strong class="bold">Lab</strong> color space, <strong class="bold">Temperature</strong> is <strong class="bold">a</strong> and <strong class="bold">Tint</strong> is <strong class="bold">b</strong>.</p>&#13;
			<p><strong class="bold">Hue</strong> is a different beast. You can see where the colors sit in each of the color wheels, and the Hue wheel moves everything around in a circle, clockwise all the way to 360°. It's easy to make something strange like this:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer466" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_11.40_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.40: The Hue wheel recolors everything, easily seen in the Y'Cb'<span>Cr Parade </span></p>&#13;
			<p>Hue is a drastic change best reserved for shots recorded on entirely the wrong settings, or crazy color<a id="_idIndexMarker779"/> grades. Be aware that Hue is likely to create visible artifacts with compressed footage, especially with higher saturation values.</p>&#13;
			<p>At this point, take a few minutes to work through your timeline, correcting each clip in turn to ensure that it's balanced and that the exposure looks about right. Try out the Color Board and Color Wheels, pick a favorite, and then choose it as your default color correction in the first page of <strong class="bold">Pr</strong><strong class="bold">eferences</strong>.</p>&#13;
			<p>Either way, you should always color-correct with the Video Scopes active, and make sure that the changes you're making aren't pushing image data beyond the 0–100 IRE range. When you're comfortable with how to use all these controls on a single clip, it's time to expand your view to nearby clips.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-297"><a id="_idTextAnchor309"/>Using the Comparison Viewer</h2>&#13;
			<p>So far, you've been looking at just a single clip at a time, but context is incredibly important. We get used to things quickly, and while a viewer might not even notice that an entire Project is a little bright, or dark or yellow, they'll instantly notice a single shot that's brighter than the last. The <strong class="bold">Comparison Viewer</strong> will help you spot these issues quickly, and it's easy to find:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">Window</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Show in Workspace</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Comparison Viewer</strong>, or <span>press </span><span><strong class="bold">⌃⌘6</strong></span><span>:</span></li>&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.41: Under Window &gt; Show in<span> Workspace</span></p>&#13;
			<p>When active, the Comparison Viewer sits to the left of the Viewer and/or Video Scopes. In fact, the Comparison Viewer has its own View menu, and from that menu you can bring up an additional set of <a id="_idIndexMarker780"/>Video Scopes (horizontal or vertical) if you wish, as shown:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer468" class="figure">&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.42: All the recent two-up screenshots have used the Comparison Viewer; vertical Video Scopes (below the image) are bes<span>t for this</span></p>&#13;
			<p>At the top of the Comparison Viewer, you'll see a two-switch tab, <strong class="bold">Timeline</strong> or <strong class="bold">Saved</strong>. With <strong class="bold">Timeline</strong>, an option at the bottom of the pane lets you choose between the <strong class="bold">Previous Edit</strong> and the <strong class="bold">Next Edit</strong>. This is ideal for comparing one shot with a neighbor, but not for anything fancier.</p>&#13;
			<p>To present any frame at all for comparison, proceed as follows:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">At the top of the <strong class="bold">Comparison Viewer</strong>, click <strong class="bold">Saved</strong> at the top, to<span> see this:</span><div id="_idContainer469" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_11.43_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.43: In Saved mode, you'll have access to the Frame Browser in the bottom left, and Save Frame in the bo<span>ttom right</span></p></li>&#13;

			<p>This displays an additional floating window that lets you choose from up to 30 previously saved<a id="_idIndexMarker782"/> frames. Although you can fill the Frame Browser with frames from any open Library, this particular collection of frames belongs to the parent Library for the current Project.</p>&#13;
			<p>Clicking any frame here shows that frame in the Comparison Viewer, and additional frames (from source clips or timelines), can be added with the <strong class="bold">plus</strong> button in the bottom left. When you're done, you can close it. There's no more convenient way to make sure all your shots match.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-298"><a id="_idTextAnchor310"/>Review — Correcting white balance, exposure, and saturation</h2>&#13;
			<p>This monster <a id="_idIndexMarker783"/>section <a id="_idIndexMarker784"/>in this monster chapter covered a lot<a id="_idIndexMarker785"/> of ground, and you've learned many techniques to balance out a series of clips. <strong class="bold">Balance Color</strong> is a great way to start, <strong class="bold">Match Color</strong> is handy sometimes, and manual controls are always important. <strong class="bold">Exposure</strong>, <strong class="bold">Saturation</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Color</strong> can be pushed with the <strong class="bold">Color Board</strong> or with <strong class="bold">Color Wheels</strong>, while <strong class="bold">Temperature</strong>, <strong class="bold">Tint</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Hue</strong> are only found in <strong class="bold">Color Wheels</strong>. The <strong class="bold">Comparison Viewer </strong>is essential when matching shot to shot, and it works with everything else, including <strong class="bold">Vide</strong><strong class="bold">o Scopes</strong>. </p>&#13;
			<p>All these controls are the right choice for initial color adjustments, but they're not always the <a id="_idIndexMarker786"/>only<a id="_idIndexMarker787"/> tools you'll use. For finer, more subtle control, read<a id="_idIndexMarker788"/> on to the &#13;
next section.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-299"><a id="_idTextAnchor311"/>Finessing contrast and more</h1>&#13;
			<p>With the image <a id="_idIndexMarker789"/>looking roughly balanced, it's now time to move a little more toward the aesthetic world of color grading, by dialing in just the right amount of contrast. The best way to add contrast to a shot without losing shadow or highlight detail is to use <strong class="bold">Color Curves</strong>, which can also be used for powerful creative color adjustments. Here, we'll look at both, and also find out what the eyedropper does.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-300"><a id="_idTextAnchor312"/>Using Color Curves to change contrast</h2>&#13;

			</ol>&#13;
			<p>If you're familiar with curves from the world of photography then you'll understand what's going on here, but let's have a quick chat about this graph:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer474" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_11.48_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.48: The unedited "straight" Luma curve graph doesn't change an<span>ything yet</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Imagine that the image data enters the graph along the bottom edge (along the <em class="italic">x</em> axis) from black on the left to white on the right. The data moves upward, and where it hits the line, it moves out to the left-hand side (the <em class="italic">y</em> axis), where black is at the bottom and white is at the top. The graph is a rectangle rather than a traditional square, but the input along the <a id="_idIndexMarker794"/>bottom edge exactly correlates to the output<a id="_idIndexMarker795"/> along the left edge, as seen here:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer475" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_11.49_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.49: Illustrating the movement from the bottom edge to the<span> left edge</span></p>&#13;
			<p>When first applied, the default straight line results in no change to the image: <strong class="source-inline">25</strong> in gives <strong class="source-inline">25</strong> out. However, the line can be moved by adding additional points to it, then moving those points. A curve that moves upward around the center will push the image brighter around the midtones but will affect the shadows and highlights less:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer476" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_11.50_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.50: A "ligh<span>ten" curve</span></p>&#13;
			<p>And again, with an illustration of the change in the raw image numbers:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer477" class="figure">&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.51: That same lighten curve with an illust<span>ration of </span>&#13;

			<p>You can see that <a id="_idIndexMarker796"/>while the <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">100</strong> points don't move<a id="_idIndexMarker797"/> at all, the change is most pronounced in the midtones.</p>&#13;
			<p>The opposite curve would darken the image, again affecting the highlights and shadows far less than the midtones:</p>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.52: A "dar<span>ken" curve</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Still, the best curve to increase contrast is an S-curve, like this:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer479" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_11.53_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.53: A contrast-boosting "S-curve" pushes<span> midtones </span>&#13;
toward the extremes, withou<span>t clipping</span></p>&#13;
			<p>You can clearly see <a id="_idIndexMarker798"/>what's happening in the <strong class="bold">Waveform</strong>, as<a id="_idIndexMarker799"/> image data is pushed from the middle (midtones) to the top (highlights) and bottom (shadows) of the graph. The image is more moody now that the light is stronger, and a viewer's attention will be more clearly focused toward the brighter areas:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer480" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_11.54_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.54: This S-curve is a bit too strong for th<span>is image, </span>&#13;
but doesn't clip the shadows or <span>highlights</span></p>&#13;
			<p>You can make as many additional points as you wish on the curve, but the fewer points you have, the easier it is to keep the line smooth. Excess points can be removed by simply clicking them and tapping the <strong class="bold">d</strong><strong class="bold">elete</strong> key.</p>&#13;
			<p>With this knowledge, you can achieve far more subtle results than are possible with the earlier tools. For<a id="_idIndexMarker800"/> example, you could boost only highlights<a id="_idIndexMarker801"/> while leaving shadows where they are, like this:</p>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.55: Boost only highlights; don't mo<span>ve shadows</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Or, you could boost shadows while lowering highlights slightly, like this:</p>&#13;

			<p>Crucially, with all these curves, the extreme shadows near 0 IRE and highlights near 100 IRE don't move at all. As a result, no shadow or highlight detail is lost outside those boundaries; the data moves within them instead.</p>&#13;

			<p class="callout">Curve adjustments can behave quite differently in a Wide Gamut HDR Library. If you're experiencing more dramatic changes than illustrated here, be sure that you're working within a standard (Rec. 709) Library.</p>&#13;
			<p>However, if you were to move the points at either end of the curve, bad things will happen: moving the edges horizontally could cause clipping, while vertical movement would reduce the<a id="_idIndexMarker804"/> dynamic range of the image. Don't <a id="_idIndexMarker805"/>do this:</p>&#13;

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-301"><a id="_idTextAnchor313"/>Using the eyedropper to sample the image</h2>&#13;
			<p>Sometimes, it's quite <a id="_idIndexMarker806"/>useful to mark a point on the curve that matches a point within the image. You might do this to note a part of the image that should stay at its current brightness, or a part that should change. Here's the process:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">In the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong>, <em class="italic">click the eyedropper</em> to the top right of the Luma curve to toggle it <span>on (blue).</span></li>&#13;
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Viewer</strong>, <em class="italic">click on part of the image with the eyedropper,</em> <span>like this:</span><div id="_idContainer486" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_11.60_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.60: Click with the eyedropper to make a point on<span> the curve</span></p><p>That's it: a new point on the curve will be created at the Luma value you clicked on, and you can click more<a id="_idIndexMarker807"/> than once if you wish. For completeness:</p></li>&#13;
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong>, <em class="italic">click the eyedropper</em> to the top right of the Luma curve to toggle it of<span>f (white).</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>If you now move the new point up, it'll get brighter; moving it down makes it darker. Don't move it to the left or right, because the point will then refer to a different source brightness.</p>&#13;
			<p>If you don't want that part of the image to change, then leave the point exactly where it is. Instead, create new points a little way along the curve, and then move those points up or down. Done. If you mess anything up, there's always <strong class="bold">Undo</strong> (<strong class="bold">⌘Z</strong>) and a hooked arrow reset button in the top-right corner.</p>&#13;
			<p>With the contrast sorted, and the Luma curve eyedropper used to lock in certain values, you're ready to get<a id="_idIndexMarker808"/> creative by playing with individual channels.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-302"><a id="_idTextAnchor314"/>Using the color channel curves</h2>&#13;
			<p>If you want to fix a<a id="_idIndexMarker809"/> big problem, or introduce a strong "look" to the image, the <strong class="bold">Red</strong>, <strong class="bold">Green</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Blue</strong> curves are a good way to do it. These function similarly to the <strong class="bold">Luma</strong> curve, but only adjust a part of the image.</p>&#13;
			<p>Instead of <em class="italic">making the image brighter</em>, on Green you'd be <em class="italic">making the image greener</em>. Instead of <em class="italic">increasing contrast with an S-curve</em>, on Blue you'd be <em class="italic">making the highlights bluer and the shadows more yellow</em>. That's called color contrast, and an S-curve on the Red channel will give you an instant "trendy vintage" look suitable for social media. Check this out:</p>&#13;

			<p>While the channel curves here are really good for creative color contrast adjustment, the Color Board and Color Wheels are probably better suited for basic balancing tasks.</p>&#13;
			<p>Probably the most fascinating thing about these channel curves is that they don't have to stay set to Red, Green, or Blue. The eyedroppers next to these channels are quite different from the Luma eyedropper, so follow these steps:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">In the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong>, click the eyedropper to the top right of the <strong class="bold">Red</strong> curve to toggle it <span>on (blue).</span></li>&#13;

			<p>You're now free to affect just that one color within the image, reducing its strength by dragging down, increasing its strength by dragging up, or increasing color contrast around that color. This doesn't let you "make all orange things dark", but instead "makes things<a id="_idIndexMarker811"/> less orange" — a stranger concept than you might think. This is something worth experimenting with, though it's very easy to move into "grading" rather than "correction" at this point.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-303"><a id="_idTextAnchor315"/>ReVIEW — Finessing contrast and more</h2>&#13;
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Color Curves</strong> adjustment is one of the most powerful adjustments in your color arsenal, but it shouldn't be your first. After using the Color Board or Color Wheels, it's the ideal way to increase contrast or to fix something specific that the blunter instruments couldn't. Master the S-curve and you're 90% of the way there. If you want to get further into creative aesthetic looks, then using curves with individual channels is a really easy way to get into it. Two quick drags and you're ready for social media.</p>&#13;
			<p>With the image looking crisper, it's time to look at correcting just part of the image.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-304"><a id="_idTextAnchor316"/>Selective corrections</h1>&#13;
			<p>Selective (or secondary) corrections <a id="_idIndexMarker812"/>allow you to correct just part of the image. You'll first need to decide which part of the image you want to change — a color, or a specific area of the frame. To change a color or a range of colors, a good place to start is the <strong class="bold">Hue/Saturation Curves</strong>. It's also possible to do the job with masks, which can limit the effect of any color correction module by their color, or by a specific shape. With one or both strategies here, you'll learn how to tweak any individual part of the image just the way you want to.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-305"><a id="_idTextAnchor317"/>Using Hue/Saturation Curves to change color</h2>&#13;
			<p>The Hue/Saturation Curves do <a id="_idIndexMarker813"/>quite a<a id="_idIndexMarker814"/> different job to Color Curves, and their main use is to change the hue or saturation of one specific part of the image. Let's play:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">⌥-click</strong> on a clip (with no corrections applied) to select it and move the Playhead to t<span>hat point.</span></li>&#13;

There are several different curves available within this correction, and each one allows you to select a specific area (by its hue, saturation, or luma) and then change it in one way. The options can each be summarized as <em class="italic">A vs B</em>, where you <em class="italic">select with A</em>, then <em class="italic">change B</em>. They are listed as follows:</p>&#13;

Dragging the <a id="_idIndexMarker833"/>top two triangle controls on <a id="_idIndexMarker834"/>each range controls which parts of the Hue, Saturation, or Luma are included, while dragging the bottom two controls governs the transition, from included to not included. Therefore, you should drag the top controls until it's nearly right, then move the bottom controls to soften the edges. Even with all these controls, if you're trying to change something substantially (such as making it very orange!) you may not be able to get to a perfect result. Lies are easier to pull off if they're close to the truth.</p>&#13;
			<p>The last masking technique can be used to finesse a color mask further, or independently. After all, you'll often want to brighten up a person in the middle of a shot, or darken the corners. Since those tasks have nothing to do with the colors in those parts of the image, for those tasks you want a shape mask.</p>&#13;

			<p>Starting again on a<a id="_idIndexMarker835"/> new clip is the best way to<a id="_idIndexMarker836"/> learn this:</p>&#13;

				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">⌥-click</strong> on a clip to select it and move the Playhead to t<span>hat point.</span></li>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.81: Adding a shape mask to a darkening c<span>olor board</span></p>&#13;
			<p>You'll now see two <a id="_idIndexMarker837"/>circles in the center of the screen. Inside the inner circle, the image is darker, and the effect reduces toward the outer circle. Beyond the outer circle, the image is unaffected:</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.82: The default shape mask on the image, with darkening now only in <span>the center</span></p>&#13;
			<p>You can control the shape mask in many ways:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Drag the central marker or a blank area within the mask to move<span> it around</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Drag the edge of the inner circle to change the size o<span>f the mask</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Drag the edge<a id="_idIndexMarker838"/> of the <a id="_idIndexMarker839"/>outer circle to increase the softness o<span>f the mask</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Drag the green dots to change the shape and size of the circle (t<span>o an oval)</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Hold ⇧</strong> as you drag the green dots to keep the current as<span>pect ratio</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Hold ⌥</strong> as you drag the green dots to change just one side o<span>f the mask</span></li>&#13;

				<li>Drag the handle connected to the center of the mask to rotat<span>e the mask</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Great — you can make the mask any size you like, and any simple shape. Soft edges mean that a viewer won't see the edge of your corrections:</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.83: The Shape Mask is now darkening an area at the edge<span> of screen</span></p>&#13;
			<p>But what if you want to change the area outside the mask rather than the inside? There are two ways to do <a id="_idIndexMarker840"/>that. The quick way is to invert the<a id="_idIndexMarker841"/> mask, so that the effect applies outside it rather than inside it:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Masks</strong> menu at the top of the <strong class="bold">Color Board</strong>, choose <strong class="bold">Inv</strong><span><strong class="bold">ert Masks</strong></span><span>:</span></li>&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.84: In the Masks menu, this third option flips thi<span>ngs around</span></p>&#13;
			<p>That's great if you just want to darken down the area outside the mask. However, there's a more complex option if you want to apply a different correction to both the inside and the outside areas of the mask:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer511" class="figure">&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.85: For more control, toggle the Inside/Outside switch and use different correction<span>s for each</span></p>&#13;
			<p>At the bottom of the Color Board, you'll see a switch: <strong class="bold">Inside/Outside</strong>. With <strong class="bold">Inside</strong> selected, as it is now, you're adjusting one side of the mask. Clicking <strong class="bold">Outside</strong> allows you<a id="_idIndexMarker842"/> to apply an entirely different<a id="_idIndexMarker843"/> correction there, starting from scratch. (As you've already inverted the mask, that's probably a little confusing because Inside and Outside are flipped, but it's handy if you want to take this further next time.)</p>&#13;
			<p>Darkening the corners of a shot adds a <em class="italic">vignette</em>, and if you make it large enough and subtle enough, it's a great effect:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

			<p>If you keep an<a id="_idIndexMarker844"/> eye out for them, you'll notice that<a id="_idIndexMarker845"/> vignettes are pretty common, and they're often created in post-production scenarios. But a single oval or rectangle, or a single color selection, can only go so far. That's OK — you can use multiple masks at the same time.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-308"><a id="_idTextAnchor320"/>Combining multiple masks together</h2>&#13;
			<p>Multiple shape masks and color masks can be<a id="_idIndexMarker846"/> combined in a number of ways to create a more complex selection than is possible with a single mask. It will be easiest to explore this last feature of masks if you have a shot of a person, ideally a seated interview-style shot. Throw it onto a timeline and we'll begin, as follows:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1"> <strong class="bold">⌥-click</strong> on the clip to select it and move the Playhead to t<span>hat point.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">⌘6</strong> to add the default color correction to <span>this clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Make a tiny change, pushing any puck just a tiny amount, to create a new c<span>orrection.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>At the top of the <strong class="bold">Color</strong> pane, click the small mask icon (a circle inside a rectangle) and choose <strong class="bold">Add S</strong><span><strong class="bold">hape Mask</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>At the bottom of the <strong class="bold">Color</strong> pane, click <strong class="bold">Outside</strong> to switch to the other side of<span> the mask.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Make a more obvious change, dragging the <strong class="bold">Master</strong> exposure puck down to darken down the outside of t<span>he circle.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Reposition and resize the mask so that it is positioned over the person's face, as a reasonably <span>soft oval.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>At the top of the <strong class="bold">Color</strong> pane, click the small mask icon (a circle inside a rectangle) and choose <strong class="bold">Add Shape Mask</strong> to add a second shape to<span> the mask.</span><p>The two <a id="_idIndexMarker847"/>masks will now add together.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Reposition and resize the mask so that it is positioned over the person's shoulders as a soft, wide oval, <span>like this:</span><div id="_idContainer513" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_11.87_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.87: With two shape masks added together, you'll see something like this (note that the shoulder mask has been enha<span>nced here)</span></p><p>The two masks now should combine to roughly select the person.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Adjust the edges of both masks to soften the edges appr<span>opriately.</span><p>It's OK if the edges of the face and shoulders are not fully covered.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Adjust the <strong class="bold">Exposure</strong> of all parts of the image to darken the area behind th<span>e subject.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Reduce the <strong class="bold">Saturation</strong> of all parts of the image to subtly de-emphasize the area behind the subjec<span>t further.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>At the bottom of the <strong class="bold">Color</strong> pane, click <strong class="bold">Inside</strong> to switch to the other side of<span> the mask.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Increase the <strong class="bold">Exposure</strong> of <a id="_idIndexMarker848"/>the subject slightly to make them more <span>prominent.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Hide the edges of the masks by clicking on the oval icon to the right of <strong class="bold">Shape Mask 1</strong> or <strong class="bold">Shape Mask 2</strong>, whichever one is curre<span>ntly blue.</span><p>Clicking the blue mask icon turns it white and hides it. To show it, click it once more. The result:</p></li>&#13;

			<p>Lighting is a critical part of drawing attention to the right part of a frame, and if the camera operator couldn't get it right on the day, you can fix it now. Don't be afraid to add light where you want people to look and to darken down areas where they shouldn't. You can make this effect strong or subtle, depending on the job.</p>&#13;
			<p>As well as multiple shape masks, it's also possible to combine shape masks with color masks; so, if you can't isolate an area with just one mask, just add another.</p>&#13;

			<p>Each <a id="_idIndexMarker849"/>additional mask can be set to <strong class="bold">Add</strong>, <strong class="bold">Subtract</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Intersect</strong> with the other masks, so you can make it as complex as you like.

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-309"><a id="_idTextAnchor321"/>Review — Selective corrections</h2>&#13;
			<p>Primary correction <a id="_idIndexMarker850"/>comes first, but secondary correction is often important too. Is an object the wrong color? Hue/Saturation Curves to the rescue. Is a person too dull? That'll need a shape mask. Something more complex? Use color masks, finesse the edges, add shape masks, and get fussy with your curves: throw everything at it. There's a ton of power here.</p>&#13;
			<p>Though not every shot requires selective correction, it's worth spending a little time making your hero shots look their very best. While it's best to avoid problems on set if you can, don't be <a id="_idIndexMarker851"/>afraid to fix it in post-production if you have to.</p>&#13;
			<p>Before this chapter closes out, here are a few techniques that'll save you a lot of time.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-310"><a id="_idTextAnchor322"/>Advanced color techniques</h1>&#13;
			<p>Correction isn't hard, but <a id="_idIndexMarker852"/>you don't want to correct every clip from scratch. In this section, you'll learn how to copy a correction from one clip to another in a few ways, how to get a head start on correction with effects presets, and how to correct entire scenes with a single adjustment. These tricks are serious time savers, and some of them are far from obvious, so don't skip this.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-311"><a id="_idTextAnchor323"/>Copying and pasting color adjustments</h2>&#13;
			<p>If multiple<a id="_idIndexMarker853"/> clips were shot in the same <a id="_idIndexMarker854"/>location at the same<a id="_idIndexMarker855"/> time, they'd <a id="_idIndexMarker856"/>probably need the same treatment, and there are a few ways to make that happen. The first and most obvious is copy and paste, and it works pretty well:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Apply several kinds of color correction <span>to a clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Select that clip, then <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> &gt; <span><strong class="bold">Copy</strong></span><span> (</span><span><strong class="bold">⌘C</strong></span><span>).</span><p>This step copies the clip and its video properties, including effects and color corrections.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Select a similar clip or clips, then choose <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Paste Effects</strong> (<strong class="bold">⌥⌘V</strong>) to instantly paste the color correction to th<span>ese clips.</span><div id="_idContainer516" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_11.90_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.90: Many copy and paste variations, with their<span> shortcuts</span></p><p>The downside of <strong class="bold">Paste Effects</strong> is that it just pastes <em class="italic">everything</em> onto the target clip(s), and you don't always want the volume changes, scale changes, and every type of color correction at once. Another option is this:</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Select a different clip or clips, then choose <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Paste Attributes</strong> (<strong class="bold">⇧⌘V</strong>) to bring up a <a id="_idIndexMarker857"/>dialog that lets you <a id="_idIndexMarker858"/>choose<a id="_idIndexMarker859"/> exactly<a id="_idIndexMarker860"/> which properties<span> to paste:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer517" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_11.91_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.91: You can now choose which attributes you wan<span>t to paste</span></p>&#13;
			<p>This takes a little longer, but it's far more powerful. You don't have to choose to paste everything, but you can uncheck items you don't want. A quick way to uncheck everything is to <strong class="bold">⌥-click</strong> on any checkbox, and everything else will be deselected. This works separately in the <strong class="bold">Video</strong> or <strong class="bold">Audio</strong> columns, so a couple of clicks may &#13;
be required.</p>&#13;
			<p>Pasting is fine, but there's still an issue, because if the target clip(s) had any kind of color correction applied already then these new corrections will be applied in addition to the existing corrections. That may be what you want, or it may not.</p>&#13;
			<p>The first way to deal with that is to clear out existing attributes before you paste, using one of these commands from the <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> menu:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Remove Effects</strong> (<strong class="bold">⌥⌘X</strong>), to remove all existing properties with<span>out asking</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Remove Attributes</strong> (<strong class="bold">⇧⌘X</strong>), to bring up a dialog that lets you selectively remove existing <span>properties</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>This way, you could <strong class="bold">Copy</strong> from one clip, then <strong class="bold">Remove Effects</strong> and <strong class="bold">Paste Effects</strong> on the target. Since <a id="_idIndexMarker861"/>these commands work<a id="_idIndexMarker862"/> not just for color, but <a id="_idIndexMarker863"/>for <a id="_idIndexMarker864"/>video properties and effects and audio properties and effects, you will get to know them pretty well. The hidden trick is that color correction is a special case, and there are three hidden commands that are far easier than copying and pasting.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-312"><a id="_idTextAnchor324"/>Applying color corrections from nearby clips</h2>&#13;
			<p>While performing a<a id="_idIndexMarker865"/> color <a id="_idIndexMarker866"/>correction pass on your edited<a id="_idIndexMarker867"/> timeline, you'll want to reuse the same corrections on subsequent clips. To do this in the absolute best way possible, you'll need to enable some hidden commands, as follows:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Open <strong class="bold">Final Cut Pro</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Commands</strong> &gt; <span><strong class="bold">Customize</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>In the top-right corner, search <span>for </span><span><strong class="source-inline">color</strong></span><span>:</span><div id="_idContainer518" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_11.92_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.92: Search for "color" at the top and you'll see three commands starting with "Apply" <span>down below</span></p><p>In the lower<a id="_idIndexMarker868"/> central <a id="_idIndexMarker869"/>area, you'll see three commands that<a id="_idIndexMarker870"/> have no shortcuts and that don't appear in any menu:</p><ul><li><strong class="bold">Apply Color Correction from Pre</strong><span><strong class="bold">vious Clip</strong></span></li><li><strong class="bold">Apply Color Correction from Three </strong><span><strong class="bold">Clips Back</strong></span></li><li><strong class="bold">Apply Color Correction from Two </strong><span><strong class="bold">Clips Back</strong></span><p>The alphabetical sort has put these commands out of order (one, three, and two clips back), but they perform magic. These hidden commands <em class="italic">copy all corrections</em> from a prior clip in the timeline, and then use those corrections to <em class="italic">replace</em> any color corrections on the selected clip. They don't apply on top of existing corrections, so there's no need to clear out existing corrections, and they don't affect any other video or audio properties or effects. Even nicer, "color corrections" in this context means everything we've looked at so far, including a Balance Color, Match Color, or any manual correction from the Color tab. All you need to do is:</p></li></ul></li>&#13;
				<li>Assign these three commands to three unused sequential keys on your<span> keyboard.</span><p>You can do this in the same way we did it earlier in the book:</p><ul><li>Choose the modifier keys you want to use (if any) at the top, and then drag the commands to un<span>used keys.</span></li><li>Choose the command you want to assign, and then use your physical keyboard to press the shortcut combination you wa<span>nt to use.</span><p>If you have an <a id="_idIndexMarker871"/>extended <a id="_idIndexMarker872"/>keyboard, I use these enough to<a id="_idIndexMarker873"/> assign them to <strong class="bold">F17</strong>/<strong class="bold">F18</strong>/<strong class="bold">F19</strong>, and I like <strong class="bold">⇧7</strong>/<strong class="bold">⇧8</strong>/<strong class="bold">⇧9</strong> on a laptop. Both options are shown here:</p></li></ul></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer519" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_11.93_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.93: Pick your own keys if you like, and single-key commands are easi<span>est to hit</span></p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="4"><strong class="bold">Save</strong> and <strong class="bold">Close</strong> when yo<span>u're done.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>These commands are faster than any other technique I've used for basic color correction. Correct one clip, and then use that correction as a starting point for the next. The third clip can use either of the two previous clips as its starting point, and if you're bouncing between two or three shots, you'll nearly always have a good color source nearby.</p>&#13;
			<p>If you revise an earlier clip's corrections, it's now trivial to update all the corrections on another similar clip that's two or three clips down the timeline. You can even select many clips at once, and then use these keys to copy the correction from a clip just prior to the leftmost clip.</p>&#13;
			<p>One thing to be aware of is that only clips in Storylines can have "prior clips," and so you'll have to fall back on copy and paste techniques with connected clips. But that's no big deal. These commands work really well with anything in a connected Storyline and in the Primary<a id="_idIndexMarker874"/> Storyline, and <a id="_idIndexMarker875"/>that's enough to save a lot <a id="_idIndexMarker876"/>of time.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">If you've shot with a camera system that can record in ProRes RAW, you can find some controls in the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> metadata view in the <strong class="bold">Info</strong> tab in the Inspector (<em class="italic">new in 10.4.9</em>). If you'd prefer to adjust the ISO there (and possibly also <strong class="bold">Exposure Offset</strong> and <strong class="bold">Temperature</strong>, if supported by your camera) before using the standard color adjustments, go ahead. Similarly, if you've shot on RED, you may wish to use the RED plugin's custom floating window to make adjustments.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">Lastly, if you've shot in <strong class="bold">Log</strong> format, you can make that "flat" camera footage look "normal" by setting the <strong class="bold">Camera LUT</strong> setting also found in the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> metadata view. Note that metadata-based adjustments apply at the clip level, before all other adjustments, and can sometimes be quite strong. You may prefer to turn this off and correct it manually.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">For more control <a id="_idIndexMarker877"/>over how a Color <strong class="bold">LUT</strong> (or <strong class="bold">Look-Up Table</strong>) is applied to a clip, and to work with pre-packaged "look LUTs," use the <strong class="bold">Custom LUT</strong> effect. This is covered in <a href="B15343_12_PreFinal_Apple_SK+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor331"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></a>, <em class="italic">Refine and Smooth: Video Properties and Effects</em>.</p>&#13;
			<p>While we're on the topic of saving time, fancy shortcuts aren't the only tool you have. Adjustment Layers aren't official, but they are real, and amazing.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-313"><a id="_idTextAnchor325"/>Using Adjustment Layers</h2>&#13;
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Adjustment Layer</strong> exists in FCP X almost by accident, and though it's easy to make one<a id="_idIndexMarker878"/> with Apple's companion program<a id="_idIndexMarker879"/> Motion, there isn't one installed by default. Just search online for <strong class="source-inline">free fcp x adjustment layer</strong>, and you'll find free installers from a number of plugin makers. Once you've downloaded one of these and installed it, you'll find it easy to use, but in an unexpected place. Here are the steps:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Reset to the <strong class="bold">Default</strong> Workspace by pr<span>essing </span><span><strong class="bold">⌘0</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Look in the <strong class="bold">Titles</strong> browser (yes, titles!) in the top left of the interface, then search for <strong class="source-inline">adjust</strong> to find the <strong class="bold">Adjustment Layer</strong> you <span>installed:</span><div id="_idContainer520" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_11.94_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.94: Search for "adjust" in the top-right corner, and you'll find it — probably with this default<span> thumbnail</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Drag the <strong class="bold">Adjustment Layer</strong> to your timeline, and change its duration to span a <span>few clips:</span><div id="_idContainer521" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_11.95_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.95: The Adjustment Layer is purple because it's a Title, and the color for that Role<span> is purple</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">⌥-click</strong> on the <strong class="bold">Adjustment Layer</strong> to select it and move the Playhead to t<span>hat point.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">⌘6</strong> to add the default color correction to the <strong class="bold">Adjustm</strong><span><strong class="bold">ent Layer</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Make an obvious change, pushing any puck or slider in any <span>direction.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>Skimming up and down the timeline, you'll see that the Adjustment Layer affects everything underneath it. An entire scene now needs only a single adjustment, and that's revolutionary; there's no need to repeat the same correction on each clip in your timeline. My color correction workflow usually looks like this:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;

			<p>This works because individual clips need individual attention, but looks are best applied broadly, to several clips at once. You can even duplicate an Adjustment Layer as an Audition to instantly offer a client different looks for an entire scene, or even an entire timeline. Used wisely, Adjustment Layers are probably the single biggest time saver in color grading.</p>&#13;
			<p>They do have one issue, however. As soon as an Adjustment Layer ends, the color change ends, and <a id="_idIndexMarker882"/>unfortunately, it's <a id="_idIndexMarker883"/>not simple to fade or otherwise transition an Adjustment Layer. While it is possible to keyframe a color effect (as you'll discover in the next chapter), that's more work.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-314"><a id="_idTextAnchor326"/>Review — Advanced color techniques</h2>&#13;
			<p>Once you've mastered<a id="_idIndexMarker884"/> the basics of color correction, make sure you master how to apply those corrections to many clips quickly. Copy and paste is OK for connected clips, but the three hidden commands to apply color from previous clips are more powerful and will speed up your work hugely.</p>&#13;
			<p>Adjustment Layers are a revolution to the color grading workflow, and though simple Projects won't need to bother with them, I've used them on a variety of more complex Projects to greatly simplify the production and review process. Vital stuff.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-315"><a id="_idTextAnchor327"/>Summary</h1>&#13;
			<p>This is the largest chapter so far, and that's OK, because using what you've learned here will make a massive difference to the quality of your work. While it's true that becoming good at color correction won't necessarily make you a better editor, it's a part of the overall package that many clients expect. Start out with the simple auto options, then move into manual corrections, and if you have the time and inclination, enhance contrast and specific areas of the image with the more advanced "grading" techniques. Even the simpler corrections can benefit from the advanced ways to copy, paste, move, and re-apply corrections, though; don't overlook these time savers.</p>&#13;
			<p>In the next chapter, you'll find out a whole lot more about video effects but also a little more about color, because some of the video effects are color-related. You'll learn how to save any number of color corrections as a color preset (stored as an effect), and also how to use Color LUTs to apply an instant color correction. Oh, and also everything to do with blurs, retiming, positioning, scaling, cropping, stabilization, animation, transitions, and just a few other things. Practice as much as you can, and see you on the next page.</p>&#13;
