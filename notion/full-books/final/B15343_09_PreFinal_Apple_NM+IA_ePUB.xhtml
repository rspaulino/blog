			<p>This chapter is all about switching one shot for another, whether you're switching angles, switching takes, or switching to something entirely different. The editing techniques vary, but the outcome is the same: making the best edit you can by using the best shot available for any particular moment. A shot you choose might be great, but if the client prefers another, you'll want to know how to switch in that new shot with the least pain. There are simple and smart ways to work, and if you shot your footage with multiple cameras, you'll approach things in an entirely different way.</p>&#13;
			<p>This chapter will show you the best ways to work with Multicam, and many techniques for how to explore your options with or without Multicam. You'll find out how to test a new shot, as well as how to replace a clip more permanently. You'll also find out how to keep multiple options in a single spot in the timeline with Auditions. To summarize, in this chapter, we'll cover the following topics:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Working with Mult<span>icam media</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Exchanging one clip wi<span>th another</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Creating and using<span> Auditions</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>To begin, we'll be diving into the world of Multicam footage. Historically, many TV and film productions have used just a single camera: perfecting the lighting for that one angle, then moving the camera and lighting before the cast repeats their performance. With Multicam, your subjects need to only perform once, but the cameras are far more likely to catch one another in shot — let alone lighting — so positioning is more restrictive. While not every production can or should record with multiple devices, Multicam techniques can be invaluable for capturing live events, interviews, and improvised narrative performances. Personally, I love it, so here we go!</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-245"><a id="_idTextAnchor254"/>Working with Multicam media</h1>&#13;
			<p>While <a href="B15343_02_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor044"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Before the Edit: Production Tips</em>, discussed how to shoot with multiple cameras and audio recorders, and <a href="B15343_03_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor084"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Bring It In: Importing Your Footage</em>, showed you <a id="_idIndexMarker572"/>how to synchronize all that footage into Multicam Clips, we haven't looked at how to edit it yet — and there are a few differences compared to regular footage. This section will take you through the process of editing with Multicam footage, including switching angles, controlling which component of a clip is switched, and some of the smaller changes that Multicam brings.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-246"><a id="_idTextAnchor255"/>Understanding Multicam footage</h2>&#13;
			<p>As discussed <a id="_idIndexMarker573"/>earlier, a Multicam Clip combines multiple angles together, synced in time. When you edit a Multicam Clip, you can choose which angle you want to see at any point, and which you want to hear:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer330" class="figure">&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.1: Here, the same person was filmed from two angles at once, to demonstrate <span>stretching</span></p>&#13;
			<p>You can run the clip continuously, showing exactly what was recorded, or remove unwanted sections:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer331" class="figure">&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.2: Part of a day-long Multicam shoot with two video angles and two additional m<span>icrophones</span></p>&#13;
			<p>While Multicam Clips are usually created with footage from multiple cameras and audio recorders working simultaneously, that's not the only way to obtain Multicam footage. When a musician lip syncs to a recorded audio track, multiple sequential shots (in the same location or in multiple <a id="_idIndexMarker574"/>locations) can be synced as separate Multicam angles:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer332" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_9.3_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.3: Five angles (even if they're not recorded at the same time) can be synced in a Multicam as a way to prese<span>nt options</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Similarly, you could sync up a screen recording of a presentation being given and a video of the presenter delivering that presentation. If you're using audio to sync all the clips together, just make sure that every camera is recording audio, and it'll go smoothly. Refer back to <a href="B15343_03_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor084"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Bring It In: Importing Your Footage</em>, for more information.</p>&#13;
			<p>Enough talk — time to play! If you haven't already imported and synced up some Multicam footage, go ahead and do that now. Any phone and any other camera will be good enough to practice with, though if you can use matched cameras with matched settings, you'll have an <a id="_idIndexMarker575"/>easier time. <a href="B15343_02_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor044"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Before the Edit: Production Tips</em>, provided some tips on this, but just make sure that you can see and hear the same things through every camera. Hit record on all your devices, speak a few sentences, and that'll do.</p>&#13;
			<p>With the footage in hand, here's the process you should have already followed:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Import your sou<span>rce clips.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Create a Multicam Clip and use the <strong class="bold">Angle Editor</strong> to check t<span>he sync.  </span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>These steps are listed in the <em class="italic">Syncing media from multiple devices</em> section of <a href="B15343_03_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor084"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Bring It In: Importing You</em><em class="italic">r Footage</em>.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">You only need the <strong class="bold">Angle Editor</strong> to make changes inside the Multicam — to correctly sync, make clip-wide changes to color or positioning, or manipulate the angles. To edit the finished clip, you'll need to place the entire Multicam Clip into a regular Project and cut it there.</p>&#13;
			<p>With your Multicam Clips ready to edit, it's simple to get started:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Select a Multicam Clip from the <strong class="bold">Browser</strong> tab and mark In and Out points as usual (select mo<span>st of it).</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Open or create a Project and append your Multicam Clip to the timeli<span>ne with </span><span><strong class="bold">E</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>To get the most out of Multicam Clips, you'll want to choose the best audio channel, and then show the <strong class="bold">Angle Viewer</strong>, which displays all your angles alongside the main <strong class="bold">Viewer</strong>. Let's choose the best audio first.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-247"><a id="_idTextAnchor256"/>Preparing to edit with the Angle Viewer</h2>&#13;
			<p>The most common scenario for Multicam editing is that you have a single good audio source and multiple video <a id="_idIndexMarker576"/>sources to choose from. Any other audio tracks have done their job by helping to sync up the other video tracks, so they weren't useless by any means. But we can start by choosing the right audio track. Let's get started:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Right-click on the Multicam Clip on the timeline. Then, choose <strong class="bold">Active Audio Angle</strong> and then the name of the corr<span>ect track:</span><div id="_idContainer333" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_9.4_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.4: Who had the best audio <span>recording?</span></p><p>If you've named your angles appropriately, this should be easy, but if not, you'll need to listen to find the best one.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Display the <strong class="bold">Angle Viewer</strong> by pre<span>ssing </span><span><strong class="bold">⇧⌘7</strong></span><span>:</span><div id="_idContainer334" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_9.5_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.5: After displaying the Angle Viewer, you can resize it and the Viewer by dragging t<span>heir edges</span></p><p>This command can also be found in the Viewer's <strong class="bold">View</strong> menu, as <strong class="bold">Angles</strong>. The Viewer pane now splits to show 2, 4, 9, or 16 angles to the left of the main Viewer. You're more likely to experience issues if you display a large number of angles here. To change how many angles you can see at once, simply go to the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> menu.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">2 Angles</strong> or <strong class="bold">4 Angles</strong> from the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> menu at the top-right of the <strong class="bold">Ang</strong><span><strong class="bold">le Viewer</strong></span><span>:</span><div id="_idContainer335" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_9.6_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.6: Choose the number of angles you want to see from the Set<span>tings menu</span></p><p>You usually only <a id="_idIndexMarker577"/>need to show video angles, so if you've got two video angles and an audio-only angle, two angles would be enough. Here, I can only see four of the five angles in this Multicam, and it's possible to switch to another bank of four angles using the icons at the bottom center of the Angle Viewer.</p><p>The most important option here is to the top-left, though.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Click on the second of the three icons to the top left of the <strong class="bold">Ang</strong><span><strong class="bold">le Viewer</strong></span><span>:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer336" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_9.7_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.7: Choose video and audio, video-only, or audio-only<span> switching</span></p>&#13;
			<p>This toggle switch now indicates that when you switch angles, you'll only switch the video angle, so the audio will remain on the angle you chose earlier (when you right-clicked and chose an audio angle). It's absolutely possible to switch audio angles (or both audio and video) if you prefer, but this will depend on how many good audio sources you have. How do you choose the best audio?</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>If you're interviewing one person or nobody at all, whichever mic sounds <span>best wins.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>If you're interviewing two <a id="_idIndexMarker578"/>people, switch to the best audio source(s) for each person as t<span>hey speak.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>It's also possible to hear multiple audio angles at once; we'll discuss this in <a href="B15343_14_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor404"><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em></a>, <em class="italic">Boost the Signal: Audio Sweetening</em>. For now, let's just switch video angles.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-248"><a id="_idTextAnchor257"/>Switching angles</h2>&#13;
			<p>Now that you've set <a id="_idIndexMarker579"/>everything up, it's time to try a live editing session, as if you're a vision mixer at a live event. Hover over the start of your Project's timeline and tap the <strong class="bold">spacebar</strong> to start playback. Then, as it plays, do either of the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Click inside the <strong class="bold">Angle Viewer</strong> to cut and switch to a <span>new angle.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press keys <strong class="bold">1</strong>, <strong class="bold">2</strong>, <strong class="bold">3</strong>… through <strong class="bold">9</strong> to cut and switch to that numbe<span>red angle:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer337" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_9.8_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.8: Soon, you'll have something like this, where you've cut between seve<span>ral angles</span></p>&#13;
			<p>While choosing angles, you can pause, rewind, or play at a faster speed. There's no need to work in real time, and you can skim to any point and tap a number key if you wish. Most simple Multicams use two video angles, so you'll be pressing <strong class="bold">1</strong>, <strong class="bold">2</strong>, <strong class="bold">1</strong>, <strong class="bold">2</strong> a lot. Every cut you add is marked with a through edit, which is a dashed line through the clip. With experience, you'll find that there are many ways to place edits, and you might switch angles for a number of reasons:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>There's no choice: A camera was obscured or not recording at t<span>hat point.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Variety: The current angle has been on screen for<span> too long.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Content: It's the best angle to show this particular piece o<span>f content.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Editing: Cutting from one angle to another to disguise a<span> jump cut.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>There are also specific considerations about exactly when an edit should be placed:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>In a pause between <a id="_idIndexMarker580"/>sentences, which also allows pauses to <span>be reduced</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Near where your subject blinks, which gives a natural <span>edit point</span></li>&#13;
				<li>To attract attention for emphasis, just before an impor<span>tant point</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>With your first angle choices made, it's time to clean it up.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-249"><a id="_idTextAnchor258"/>Replacing and editing existing angles</h2>&#13;
			<p>If you've got <a id="_idIndexMarker581"/>the cuts in the right places, terrific! If you've added a cut in error, you can select it with a click, and then press <strong class="bold">delete</strong> to get rid of it. If <a id="_idIndexMarker582"/>you just want to move the cut, you can perform a <strong class="bold">Roll</strong> edit, but you don't need to switch to the <strong class="bold">Trim</strong> tool. <em class="italic">The Select tool will automatically perform a Roll edit when used with Multi</em><em class="italic">cam Clips</em>:</p>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.9: Clicking and dragging on any edit point to Roll it with the S<span>elect tool</span></p>&#13;
			<p>What if you do need to remove some part of the clip? You've got various options here:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Switch to the <strong class="bold">Trim</strong> tool (<strong class="bold">T</strong>), move to the edge of a clip, and then click and drag to perform a regular one-point ripple <span>trim edit:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.10: Using the Trim tool to perform regular ripple trim edits on Mult<span>icam Clips</span></p>&#13;

				<li>Switch to the <strong class="bold">Range Selection</strong> tool (<strong class="bold">R</strong>) and select and <strong class="bold">Delete</strong> part of<span> the clip:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.11: The Range Selection tool can still select parts of clips fo<span>r deletion</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Removing <a id="_idIndexMarker583"/>part of a Multicam Clip means that the edits around it are no longer "through" edits, and will no longer be indicated <a id="_idIndexMarker584"/>by a dashed line:</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.12: Through edits are dashed and indicate angle changes; no dashes means content w<span>as removed</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Lastly, what if you've simply chosen the wrong angle for a particular part of the clip? You can change any existing angles, within any region, without adding new cuts. While playing or hovering, do either of the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">⌥-click</strong> in the <strong class="bold">Angle Viewer</strong> to switch the current clip to a <span>new angle.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">⌥1</strong>, <strong class="bold">⌥2</strong>, <strong class="bold">⌥3</strong>… through <strong class="bold">⌥9</strong> to switch the current clip to a <span>new angle.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Personally, I always use the keys – clicking is too slow, and it's the only way to work while hovering over the timeline. But there's one more option that's important here.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-250"><a id="_idTextAnchor259"/>Editing inside a Multicam angle</h2>&#13;
			<p>The nature of Multicam footage is that the recordings are sometimes quite long, and that means that you <a id="_idIndexMarker585"/>can apply changes to an entire angle at once. Though this will become more useful after <a href="B15343_11_PreFinal_Apple_SK+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor296"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, <em class="italic">Play with Light: Color Correction and Grading</em>, if you need to make any changes to an entire Multicam angle at once, you can simply do the following:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Double-click on a Multicam Clip to jump inside the <strong class="bold">Ang</strong><span><strong class="bold">le Editor</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Make changes (for example, audio volume) to a particu<span>lar angle.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Click once on the leftward arrow to the left of the center bar to return to you<span>r Project:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer342" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_9.13_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.13: The left-pointing arrow is the key to jumping back to yo<span>ur Project</span></p>&#13;
			<p>This operation changes every instance of that angle with the Multicam Clip in the timeline, and it's therefore the best way to make global adjustments. Remember to look at the icons to the top left of each angle to know which angle is seen and which angles are heard:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer343" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_9.14_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.14: Inside the Angle Editor, I can see and hear the angl<span>e "iain," </span>&#13;
and also hear the an<span>gle "ray1"</span></p>&#13;
			<p>If you're making visual changes in the Inspector (more in <a href="B15343_11_PreFinal_Apple_SK+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor296"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, <em class="italic">Play with Light: Color Correction and Grading</em>) then be sure to click on the <strong class="bold">TV</strong> icon to the left of an angle's name, to make sure you're viewing the angle you've selected. You can hear more than one angle at once, but you'll only see one at a time.</p>&#13;
			<p>A strong recommendation is to <a id="_idIndexMarker586"/>always do as much basic correction (to color, audio, and cropping) within the Multicam angles, and not at the timeline level. Consistency in color correction is easier when the Angle Viewer is showing you all angles at once, and you'll be able to match up all the angles pretty quickly. Overall, it'll be far easier, far more consistent, and can even avoid some issues with audio plug-ins that behave differently on short clips when compared to long ones.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-251"><a id="_idTextAnchor260"/>Review — working with Multicam media</h2>&#13;
			<p>Multicam is an awesome way to work, but remember that it's not the only trick you've got; you can still use regular B-roll as connected cutaway clips above a Multicam Clip. All the other techniques you've <a id="_idIndexMarker587"/>learned still work perfectly well, it's just that you've got extra options now. Prepare your Multicam Clips, show the <strong class="bold">Angle Viewer</strong>, cut and switch angles to get started, then switch angles without cutting to change your mind, dip inside the <strong class="bold">Angle Editor</strong> to make changes at a lower level, and jump back up to move the edit points wherever you want. Lovely.</p>&#13;
			<p>But hey — if your production didn't shoot with multiple cameras, that's OK too — read on to learn simple (and smart) techniques for exchanging one shot with another.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-252"><a id="_idTextAnchor261"/>Exchanging one clip with another</h1>&#13;
			<p>Multicam angles are a delightful luxury, but even without them, you've got more flexibility than you <a id="_idIndexMarker588"/>might think. If, for example, you prefer one reaction shot to another, it doesn't matter if that reaction was reacting to those exact words at that exact time — it can be from any take, as long as nobody's lips are seen moving incorrectly. If you can see someone's lips moving to words you can't hear, or see lips not moving when you can hear they should be, you're pretty much locked into the matching audio for that shot.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">Once you realize this, you'll see that reaction shots are frequently "cheated" in this way. An editor will often end up choosing the best reaction shot, and if you can see the head movements of a person actually speaking, you'll notice that the words they're saying probably aren't quite in sync, or worse, are from a completely different part of their conversation.</p>&#13;
			<p>It's far less of a challenge to switch out one B-roll shot for another, and a client may have perfectly good reasons why a shot you like is actually no good at all. A smart editor keeps alternatives at hand, and here, you'll find two ways to try out an alternative clip. There's the simple, more temporary way, and the smarter, more official way. Later, we look at another technique that gives you the best of both worlds, but let's start with the simple option first.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-253"><a id="_idTextAnchor262"/>Showing or hiding a clip</h2>&#13;
			<p>Toggling a clip on and off is a <a id="_idIndexMarker589"/>basic technique, and likely one you'd use in <a id="_idIndexMarker590"/>an everyday situation, such as when you want to test out a new silent B-roll shot to replace another. Quite simply, you do the following:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Select a new B-roll shot in your Browser that you're considering as a re<span>placement.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Hover over the start of the B-roll shot in your timeline that you want t<span>o replace.</span></li>&#13;

			<p>With your choice made, you can delete whichever clip you like least, or keep the alternate choice hidden and give your client the final word. To switch back to the original B-roll choice, do the following:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Select the top clip and press <strong class="bold">V</strong> t<span>o hide it.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Select the bottom clip and press <strong class="bold">V</strong> t<span>o show it.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>The nice thing about this technique is that it's obvious; there's a clear visual reminder in the timeline that's there's a disabled clip at a certain point, and this alone can prompt you (or your client) to take another look:</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.17: Back to the way it was, but with an additional choice<span> available</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Because a disabled B-roll clip is <a id="_idIndexMarker593"/>totally independent, it doesn't necessarily have to be the same length as any other clips, nor does it need to start at the same <a id="_idIndexMarker594"/>point. Be sure that any new clips you've placed on top start exactly at or slightly before the start point of any older clips below it; otherwise, you'll see a flash frame of the lower clip in your final output.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">An additional technique is to move alternate clips <em class="italic">underneath</em> the Primary Storyline rather than above. I've sometimes used this to store spare clips near their original source position while keeping the top area clear, and I also disable these clips to reduce their visual footprint.</p>&#13;
			<p>When the final choice has been made, you can simply leave the replacement clip visible above and (if you want) disable the old clip below. If you're sure you don't need it, and if it's not going to cause any other changes to your timeline, you could simply delete the old clip. With independent connected clips, there's no problem, but with Primary or connected Storylines, deleting a clip could lead to trouble:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>If the deleted clip is on the Primary Storyline and has clips connected to it, those connected clips could b<span>e deleted.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>If the deleted clip is in a connected Storyline, other clips in the Storyline c<span>ould move.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>If the replacement clip is longer than the deleted clip, other clips c<span>ould move:</span></li>&#13;

			<p>It's true that <a id="_idIndexMarker595"/>simple has its benefits, but it also has its flaws. Even if you use toggling visibility as a quick check, you'll <a id="_idIndexMarker596"/>want to use another, more permanent technique to permanently exchange one clip for <a id="_idIndexMarker597"/>another. This is known as replacing.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-254"><a id="_idTextAnchor263"/>Replacing clips</h2>&#13;
			<p>This technique doesn't give your client options — it simply switches one clip out for another. You'd use <a id="_idIndexMarker598"/>this once you've made a decision; that is, when you know that one shot needs to go and you have the replacement handy. There are several ways to replace a clip, but here's a simple starting point:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Select a new source clip in your Browser that you want to use as a re<span>placement:</span><div id="_idContainer348" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_9.19_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.19: Selecting your replacement region from a clip in t<span>he Browser</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">Video Only</strong> from the drop-down menu next to the edit buttons on the left side of the central<span> gray bar:</span><div id="_idContainer349" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_9.20_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.20: The icons will change to show that only video will<span> be added </span>&#13;
to th<span>e timeline</span></p><p>You can replace clips with or without audio, but in this case, we don't want to include audio in the replacement clip. To include audio instead, simply skip this step, or set the menu next to the edit buttons to <strong class="bold">All</strong>.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Drag the selection <a id="_idIndexMarker599"/>directly onto the destination clip in your timeline that you want to replace, and hold the mouse bu<span>tton down:</span><div id="_idContainer350" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_9.21_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.21: This B-roll clip, between two interview clips, can b<span>e replaced</span></p><p>At this point, the clip you've dragged onto the timeline will light up, tinted with white. This tells you that a menu is about to appear with replacement options.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>When the clip highlights in white, release the mouse and select <strong class="bold">Replace</strong> from the menu tha<span>t appears:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer351" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_9.22_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.22: Choose Replace from the menu, if that's the b<span>est option</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The original clip will now be replaced with the new clip.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">If you'd prefer to use the keyboard (and not wait for that menu to appear), then select both the source (<strong class="bold">Browser</strong>) and destination (<strong class="bold">Timeline</strong>) clips, and press <strong class="bold">⇧R</strong> to <strong class="bold">Replace</strong> instead.</p>&#13;
			<p>When you're exchanging one connected B-roll clip with another, this is unlikely to ruffle any feathers. If the new clip is a little longer or shorter, you won't mind, and nothing's going to be pushed out of sync <a id="_idIndexMarker600"/>because connected clips are independent. If you're replacing a Primary Storyline clip, connected clips will still be connected, and you never have to delete anything. All good, right? Not quite — there's &#13;
a gap:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer352" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_9.23_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.23: After replacing the clip, there's now a silent ga<span>p because </span>&#13;
this new B-roll clip is longer than t<span>he old one</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Because there's no guarantee that your source and destination clips are the same length, using the <strong class="bold">Replace</strong> command could cause your Primary Storyline (or a connected Storyline) to ripple, and potentially change sync relationships further down the timeline. This is especially important if you've added music and  synced it to your existing edit; changing the length of any clip could cause sync problems with &#13;
the music.</p>&#13;
			<p>Therefore, to make any clip replacements for a nearly finished timeline, you might want to use <strong class="bold">Replace from Start</strong> rather than <strong class="bold">Replace</strong>. It's almost as simple to use:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Select a new source clip in your Browser that you want to use as a re<span>placement.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Drag the selection directly onto the shot in your timeline that you want t<span>o replace.</span><p>The clip you've dragged onto the timeline will light up once more.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Release the mouse and select <strong class="bold">Replace from Start</strong> from the menu tha<span>t appears:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer353" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_9.24_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.24: Replace from Start, from the same menu<span> as before</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The key for this (assuming both clips are selected) is <strong class="bold">⌥R</strong>, and the outcome is usually closer to what you want. With a regular <strong class="bold">Replace</strong>, the In and Out points that were selected in the Browser are <a id="_idIndexMarker601"/>both observed, and if the source clip is longer or shorter than the destination clip, the length of that clip changes. But with <strong class="bold">Replace from Start</strong>, the timeline clip stays the same length:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer354" class="figure">&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.25: No silent gap is added as the new cli<span>p matches </span>&#13;
the duration of th<span>e old clip</span></p>&#13;
			<p>How? The Out point of the source clip is ignored, and the length of the destination clip in the timeline is used to determine the Out point on the source clip. If there's insufficient media, you'll be given a warning, as any replacement would cause a ripple edit:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer355" class="figure">&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.26: You'll see this if you replace with media that isn't<span> available</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Any time the duration of the timeline clip is more important than the duration of the source clip, I'll use <strong class="bold">Replace from Start</strong>. Early in the process, I'm happy to use <strong class="bold">Replace</strong>, but once a timeline is close to being completed, I don't want to mess anything up.</p>&#13;
			<p>There's also a third option, <strong class="bold">Replace from End</strong>, which ignores the In point of the source clip and instead starts from the Out point, moving backward until it has enough media to fill in the gap. This is <a id="_idIndexMarker602"/>similar to backtiming when connecting or overwriting, and you'd use it when a clip has to finish at a specific point – for example, a smile, a look, or a light activating on a control panel. By default, <strong class="bold">Replace from End</strong> has no shortcut key, but you could assign it something like <strong class="bold">⌥⇧R</strong> if you wanted to add one.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-255"><a id="_idTextAnchor264"/>Review — exchanging one clip with another</h2>&#13;
			<p>Of all these <strong class="bold">Replace</strong>-related options, I usually prefer to use <strong class="bold">Replace from Start</strong> because the length of a <a id="_idIndexMarker603"/>clip in the timeline is usually the most important. If you frequently use music, you may well feel the same, but if you like to use <strong class="bold">Replace</strong> or <strong class="bold">Replace from End</strong>, they're totally fine. I do recommend using a keyboard shortcut for these commands because waiting for menus to appear becomes tiresome. Still, I will sometimes connect a clip above and disable it so that I have a backup choice sitting there just in case. Simple operations have their strengths too.</p>&#13;
			<p>Replacing is a final decision, and though it keeps the timeline neat, it doesn't remember that alternate clip. Wouldn't it be great if there was an easy way to keep both options alive, to offer a client multiple <a id="_idIndexMarker604"/>takes while keeping the timeline neat? Turns out there is, and you'll learn about it next.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-256"><a id="_idTextAnchor265"/>Creating and using Auditions</h1>&#13;
			<p>Auditions are the happy middle ground between placing a disabled clip above another clip and fully <a id="_idIndexMarker605"/>replacing one clip with another. With <strong class="bold">Auditions</strong>, any clip can be switched out, at any time, for one of several alternative "picks." You could <a id="_idIndexMarker606"/>use them to give a client a choice of several B-roll alternatives, different takes on the Primary Storyline, or even different treatments for titles or effects. The easiest way to use Auditions is pretty similar to replacing:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Select a new source clip in your Browser that you want to try as a potential re<span>placement.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Drag the selection directly onto the shot in your timeline that you want t<span>o replace.</span><p>The clip you've dragged onto the timeline will light up.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Release the left mouse button and select <strong class="bold">Replace as Audition</strong> from the menu tha<span>t appears.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>The shortcut is <strong class="bold">⇧</strong><strong class="bold">Y</strong> if you prefer to use keys for these operations. Either way, after using <strong class="bold">Replace as Audition</strong>, the new clip takes the place of the old clip in the timeline. If the length of the new clip is different to the length of the old clip, it will have moved the downstream clips into a Storyline:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer356" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_9.27_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.27: Dragging to Replace, but choosing a <span>new option</span></p>&#13;
			<p>So far, it's like using <strong class="bold">Replace</strong>, but if you look to the clip in the timeline, you'll see a small spotlight icon at the top-left corner. This indicates that the clip is an Audition, and if you click this icon, a popup will show you the other possible options that could be switched in — <strong class="bold">picks</strong> within an <strong class="bold">Audition</strong>:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer357" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_9.28_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.28: As with the standard Replace command, there's now a silent gap because this clip <span>was longer</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Indeed, you can repeat this operation, adding as many different picks as you wish to this same Audition clip, and <a id="_idIndexMarker607"/>then changing between them. The pop-up <strong class="bold">Audition</strong> window uses a star to indicate the currently selected pick and dots to show the others, as well as showing a thumbnail of the <a id="_idIndexMarker608"/>currently chosen pick above, with other picks to the left and/or right. Thumbnails can be clicked on so that you can choose a new pick, and you can use shortcuts too:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">⌃⌥←</strong> to switch to the pre<span>vious pick</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">⌃⌥→</strong> to switch to the<span> next pick</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Both the in-timeline pop-up menu and the <strong class="bold">Clip</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Audition</strong> submenu also offer an additional command called <strong class="bold">Add to Audition</strong>. This adds a new pick to the list, but doesn't replace the current pick:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer358" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_9.29_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.29: The main menu shows all the<span> shortcuts</span></p>&#13;
			<p>There's also a <strong class="bold">Duplicate</strong> button if you'd like to add another pick based on the currently selected pick. This is useful if you want to present options such as a wider or tighter version of a clip, with two different color correction treatments, or with one clip slipped to show a different part of the same piece of media. Duplicating is handy, and you should return to it once you've learned about color correction, video effects, and audio effects, which you'll do in <a href="B15343_11_PreFinal_Apple_SK+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor296"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, <em class="italic">Play with Light: Color Correction and Grading</em>, <a href="B15343_12_PreFinal_Apple_SK+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor331"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></a>, <em class="italic">Refine and Smooth: Video Properties and Effects</em>, and <a href="B15343_14_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor404"><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em></a>, <em class="italic">Boost the Signal: Audio Sweetening</em>. If you're feeling fancy, an alternative command, <strong class="bold">Clip</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Audition</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Duplicate from Original</strong>, duplicates from the first pick in the list. When you're finished, press <strong class="bold">Done</strong> to dismiss the <strong class="bold">Audit</strong><strong class="bold">ion</strong> popup.</p>&#13;
			<p>There's <a id="_idIndexMarker609"/>also one more way to create Auditions — in the Browser rather than the Timeline. If you can't decide <a id="_idIndexMarker610"/>which collection of clips is best, then do the following:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Click and drag (or use <strong class="bold">I</strong> and <strong class="bold">O</strong>) to select a "good" region in each of your potential clips in th<span>e </span><span><strong class="bold">Browser</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Hold down the <strong class="bold">⌘</strong> key and click on each of the clips you want to include in order to add them to your current <span>selection.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">Clip</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Audition</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Create</strong> (<strong class="bold">⌘Y</strong>) to create a new Audition clip in the <strong class="bold">Brows</strong><span><strong class="bold">er</strong></span><span> window:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer359" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_9.30_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.30: In the Browser window, an Audi<span>tion uses </span>&#13;
a floating window rather th<span>an a popup</span></p>&#13;
			<p>When this Audition clip is added to a timeline, all the different clips are present as picks. If you know that the client will want to see different options, this is a clean way to present them. Still, a few interesting facts about Auditions should be kept in mind if you decide to use them, because they have pros and cons.</p>&#13;
			<p>Firstly, <em class="italic">the length of each clip within an Audition is remembered</em>. If you change the length of an Audition pick and then switch to another pick within the Audition, the duration will change to the length of the newly chosen clip. This is good if you want to duplicate an Audition to compare long and short versions of the same clip, but this is something to remember if you don't want your timeline to ripple.</p>&#13;
			<p>Secondly, <em class="italic">anything connected to an Audition clip on the Primary Storyline is actually connected to the current Audition pick</em>. This includes any connected clips, and even the <a id="_idIndexMarker611"/>durations of those connected clips. If you change to a different pick within the Audition, anything connected <a id="_idIndexMarker612"/>to the current pick will disappear and be replaced with whatever's connected to the new pick. This is terrific if you want to quickly switch between different groups of sound effects connected to a clip. Let's look at how to do this:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Find a clip you like in the Primary Storyline and connect one or more sound effe<span>cts to it.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Select the clip, then choose <strong class="bold">Clip</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Audition</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Duplicate as</strong><span><strong class="bold"> Audition</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Delete any clips connected to the Audition, then connect one or more new sound effe<span>cts to it.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Switch between the different Audition picks to switch all the sound effects connecte<span>d to them:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer360" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_9.31_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.31: The "Drink 2" sound effect is attached to the second pick in thi<span>s Audition</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Nice as this is, this feature means you have to be wary when trimming anything that's connected to an Audition clip — your changes may be lost if the Audition pick changes. To be safe, you can use <strong class="bold">Clip</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Audition</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Finalize Audition</strong> to lock in the current pick and remove the special Audition status.</p>&#13;
			<p>Thirdly, <em class="italic">there's no command to replace an Audition from the start or end</em>. Therefore, if you want to add a new clip that's the same length as the old clip, you'll have to:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Select the destination clip in your<span> timeline.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">⌃D</strong> and note its<span> duration.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Select a new source clip in your Browser that you want to try as a potential re<span>placement.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">⌃D</strong> and type in the duration you just noted down, followed <span>by </span><span><strong class="bold">return</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">⇧Y</strong> to <strong class="bold">Replace and Add to</strong><span><strong class="bold"> Audition</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>This is obviously a little more work, but it does give you a really nice way to present a client with options that have identical durations. </p>&#13;
			<p>Auditions can be very powerful, but bring a little complexity due to how they work with the Magnetic Timeline <a id="_idIndexMarker613"/>and with connections. If you would like to use Auditions but would prefer to avoid this <a id="_idIndexMarker614"/>complexity, consider using Auditions only as connected clips, where pick changes within the Audition won't affect anything else, or remember to <strong class="bold">f</strong><strong class="bold">inalize</strong> them w<a id="_idTextAnchor266"/>hen you're sure of your choices. Alternatively, don't use them at all — just toggle clips on and off with <strong class="bold">V</strong> instead.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-257"><a id="_idTextAnchor267"/>Review — creating and using Auditions</h2>&#13;
			<p>Auditions aren't essential, but if you're aware of how they work, they can offer a great way to experiment safely, as well as <a id="_idIndexMarker615"/>impress your client in a review session. Along with the simpler option of replacing, you should now understand several ways to swap one clip for another in a seamless way, either retaining the original clip or not. Stay aware of the special properties of Auditions, and use them wisely. Impressing clients is great, but confusing yourself in front of a client? Not so much.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-258"><a id="_idTextAnchor268"/>Summary</h1>&#13;
			<p>This chapter looked at a variety of high-level ways to swap out one clip for another. With the best planning and careful shooting, you can capture multiple angles at once, and then switch between them on the timeline for a simpler, more flexible editing experience. With or without Multicam, you can present your clients with extra options on the timeline, either through simple visibility toggles, full clip replacement, or the more powerful and more complex Auditions.</p>&#13;
			<p>If these high-level solutions don't give you enough flexibility, then there are tricks you can use to give you more, and we'll cover these in the next chapter. There, you'll learn how to throw your media into Compound Clips early in the process, grouping parts of a timeline into their own little bubbles and making revisions easier. You'll also discover the lower-level <strong class="bold">Relink</strong> feature, see how to navigate in new and useful ways, and make sure that the client review is a simple, error-free process. These are the final editing tricks you'll need, and they're coming right up.</p>&#13;
