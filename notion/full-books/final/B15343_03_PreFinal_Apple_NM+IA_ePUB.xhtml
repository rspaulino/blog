			<p>Now that you have a grasp of the basics of the user interface and you know how to get good shots, I'll show you how a good edit should begin — by bringing your media into the app. You'll understand your options for media management, how to set up a new Library, the subtle differences between different kinds of import operations, all about transcoding and proxies, how to sync up multiple cameras and dual-system audio, and the basics of Roles.</p>&#13;
			<p>Roles are a feature that's unique to <strong class="bold">Final Cut Pro X</strong> (<strong class="bold">FCP X</strong>). Applying and using them early can make the editing process easier in a number of ways, by giving you color-coding in the timeline, and enabling powerful audio editing techniques late in the process. Roles are also vital for audio turnaround on larger Projects.</p>&#13;
			<p>Specifically, this chapter covers the following topics:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Creating a Library (in the ri<span>ght place)</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Understanding original, optimized, and pro<span>xy footage</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Importing media in diff<span>erent ways</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Syncing media from multip<span>le devices</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Understanding and appl<span>ying Roles</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>By the end of this chapter, you'll know how to start any job in FCP X and how to import and prepare your media for editing. This may end up being a simple process, but it's good to know about the more complex possibilities, too.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-82"><a id="_idTextAnchor085"/>Creating a Library (in the right place)</h1>&#13;
			<p>Everything you do in <a id="_idIndexMarker144"/>FCP X is stored somewhere in a <strong class="bold">Library</strong>. Events live in a Library, and everything else lives in an Event: video and audio clips, your edited Projects, photos, and music you've used — the lot. If you follow the most basic workflow, this can be a simple process, but there are reasons why you might want to go down a more complex path.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-83"><a id="_idTextAnchor086"/>Creating and naming a Library</h2>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Choose <strong class="bold">File</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">New</strong> <span>&gt; </span><span><strong class="bold">Library</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Give your<a id="_idIndexMarker145"/> Library a sensible name, corresponding<a id="_idIndexMarker146"/> to the entire job it r<span>epresents.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>A good name might be derived from a simple rule, such as <strong class="source-inline">Year-Month ClientNameJobName</strong>, producing <strong class="source-inline">2020-01 SuperCo Internal Messaging</strong>. The reason why I prefer to use a numeric year-month format (<strong class="source-inline">YYYY-MM</strong>, part of ISO 8601) at the start of Library names is that it alphabetizes correctly as you add more and more Libraries to the same folder. Bad names will make Libraries hard to find, so avoid giving no name or a generic name, such as the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="source-inline">Untitled</strong></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="source-inline">Untitled2</strong></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="source-inline">Vi</strong><span><strong class="source-inline">deoProject</strong></span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="source-inline">TEMP</strong></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="source-inline">Edit v1</strong></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Once you've got a good name, save your Library on a fast drive with <em class="italic">plenty</em><em class="italic"> of space</em>.</p>&#13;
			<p>As mentioned in <a href="B15343_01_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor013"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Quick Start: An Introduction to FCP X</em>, this could be an SSD, a RAID, or another drive. While an external drive is preferred, an internal drive is OK if it's got plenty of space. Why does this matter? Because, by default, <em class="italic">all of the media you import to your Library will be copied inside it</em>. That will take a lot of space, potentially hundreds of <strong class="bold">Gigabytes </strong>(<strong class="bold">GB</strong>), and running out of space will stop you in your tracks.</p>&#13;
			<p>Now that you have a Library, you'll also have an <strong class="bold">Event</strong> — it will have been created automatically and named for today's date. I prefer to click on this default Event first and rename it <strong class="source-inline">media</strong>, but<a id="_idIndexMarker147"/> if today's date is relevant, feel free to <a id="_idIndexMarker148"/>leave it as it is. You can create as many Events as you wish, and you can move clips and Projects between Events simply by dragging them around. Create a new Library for each independent job because a single monolithic Library will eventually grow too large.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-84"><a id="_idTextAnchor087"/>Deciding where to store media</h2>&#13;
			<p>Although <em class="italic">media files are stored inside a Library</em> by default, if you've ever changed this option, it will have<a id="_idIndexMarker149"/> been changed for any new Libraries as well — so, it's worth double-checking. Here's the simple process to do so:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Click once on the name of the Library in th<span>e browser.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Look in the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> window on the right-hand side of the interface to find <strong class="bold">Library P</strong><span><strong class="bold">roperties</strong></span><span>:</span><div id="_idContainer074" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_3.1_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 3.1: In the Inspector window, Modify Settings is the button you're looking for"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.1: In the Inspector window, Modify Settings is the button you're l<span>ooking for</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>At the top of these settings, next to <strong class="bold">Storage Locations</strong>, click on the <strong class="bold">Modify Settings</strong> button (no<span>t </span><span><strong class="bold">Modify</strong></span><span>).</span><p>A sheet will slide down from the top of the main window:</p><div id="_idContainer075" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_3.2_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 3.2: Modify Settings allows you to change the storage location of all of these items"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.2: Modify Settings allows you to change the storage location of all of t<span>hese items</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>The <strong class="bold">In Library</strong> option should be selected for <strong class="bold">Media</strong> although the menu will let you choose <a id="_idIndexMarker150"/>an external folder on any connec<span>ted drive.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p><strong class="bold">In Library</strong> (think of this as <em class="italic">self-contained</em>) is the option I strongly recommend, especially to new editors. It's dead simple, nearly foolproof, and very easy to move around. A <strong class="bold">self-contained Library</strong> on an external drive can be opened on any other Mac with FCP X then opened up with no issues due to missing media.</p>&#13;
			<p>If you store your media in a folder outside a Library, you gain access to more advanced collaborative workflows, but it can also create headaches. First, you now have two things to move around — a Library without media and the media itself. If you want to move to a different Mac, you have to move both of these, and you might need to reconnect your media on that second Mac. This process can be easy, but often it's not. Remember from <a href="B15343_02_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor044"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Before the Edit: Production Tips</em>, how some cameras like to repeat the same filenames on different SD cards? This is a potential hassle that's worth avoiding.</p>&#13;
			<p>The other storage locations here govern the location of other important assets:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Motion Content</strong> includes the effects, transitions, titles, and generators used in y<span>our edits.</span><p>The default option, <strong class="bold">In Motion Templates folder</strong>, means that <strong class="bold">Motion Content</strong> must be installed on your Mac. Normally, that's fine because a wide range of motion-made content is included with FCP X. However, if you were to use a custom or third-party title, then move this Library to another Mac, the title would be missing because it's only stored in the <strong class="source-inline">Motion Templates</strong> folder on the original Mac.</p><p>To avoid this problem, you can switch the <strong class="bold">Motion Content</strong> storage location to <strong class="bold">In Library</strong>, and then choose <strong class="bold">File</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Consolidate Motion Content</strong>. This means that any motion-made content will be stored directly in the Library and will be <a id="_idIndexMarker151"/>available on any other Mac that opens this Library. Be aware that more complex commercial plugins will need to be fully installed on each Mac that they're used on, but this will take care of most custom titles, generators, effects, and transitions.</p></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Cache</strong> includes render files, analysis files, thumbnail images, and audio waveform files, and while this can take up a bit of space, it's normally best left inside th<span>e Library.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>It's important to note that if you change any of these storage locations, you are changing the settings for future Libraries you create. Also, existing media in the current Library will not automatically be moved to a new location, so if there is any media in the Library, it's usually best to follow up with a <strong class="bold">Consolidate </strong>operation to keep it all together:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Click on the Library's icon in the browser to s<span>elect it. </span><p>Clicking on a Library's icon is safest, although clicking on the name usually works too. (Be aware that if a Library is already selected, a second click on its name will rename it.)</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">File</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Consolidate Library</strong><span><strong class="bold"> Media...:</strong></span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer076" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.3_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 3.3: The File menu when a Library (rather than an Event) is selected"/>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.3: The File menu when a Library (rather than an Event) i<span>s selected</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Consolidate </strong>process pops up an additional dialog box, confirming what types of media you want to include:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer077" class="figure">&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.4: You can choose to consolidate any or all of these m<span>edia types</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The quick <a id="_idIndexMarker152"/>approach is to simply check the kinds of media you want to include and let FCP X do its job. Note that if you attempt to consolidate media types that don't exist, FCP X will now (as of version 10.4.9) offer to create them for you. Don't just tick all the boxes! Still, if you've used these media types, you'll want to copy them. However, before we explore the details of optimized and proxy media, let's have a quick recap.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-85"><a id="_idTextAnchor088"/>Review — creating a Library (in the right place)</h2>&#13;
			<p>The simplest <a id="_idIndexMarker153"/>approach is as follows:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Create a Library with a sensible name, one for each j<span>ob you do.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Save your Library on a fast storage device with plenty<span> of space.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Store media inside th<span>e Library.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>In more advanced workflows, you might store your media outside the Library, and that's OK, too. If that's<a id="_idIndexMarker154"/> your choice, just remember that you'll need to manage your media with a little more care.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-86"><a id="_idTextAnchor089"/>Understanding original, optimized, and proxy footage</h1>&#13;
			<p>You will <a id="_idIndexMarker155"/>recall<a id="_idIndexMarker156"/> from <a href="B15343_02_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor044"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Before the Edit: Production Tips</em>, that different cameras<a id="_idIndexMarker157"/> record in different codecs and at different data rates. A few typical cameras with their resolutions, codecs, and data rates, respectively, are as follows:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>iPhone — 1080p, HEVC, 30 fps: <strong class="bold">8 Mbps</strong><span> or </span><span><strong class="bold">1 MB/s</strong></span></li>&#13;
				<li>iPhone — UHD 4K, HEVC, 24 fps: <strong class="bold">18 Mbps</strong> or<span> </span><span><strong class="bold">2.25 MB/s</strong></span></li>&#13;
				<li>iPhone — UHD 4K, H.264, 24 fps: <strong class="bold">36 Mbps</strong> o<span>r </span><span><strong class="bold">4.5 MB/s</strong></span></li>&#13;
				<li>GH5 — UHD 4K, H.264, 24/25/30 fps 8-bit: <strong class="bold">100 Mbps</strong> or<span> </span><span><strong class="bold">12.5 MB/s</strong></span></li>&#13;
				<li>GH5 — UHD 4K, H.264, 24/25/30 fps 10-bit: <strong class="bold">150 Mbps</strong> or <span><strong class="bold">18.75 MB/s</strong></span></li>&#13;
				<li>GH5 — 4992x3744, HEVC, 24/25/30 fps: <strong class="bold">200 Mbps</strong> <span>or </span><span><strong class="bold">25 MB/s</strong></span></li>&#13;
				<li>Canon EOS C200 — H.264, UHD 4K, 24/25/30 fps 8-bit: <strong class="bold">150 Mbps</strong> or <span><strong class="bold">18.75 MB/s</strong></span></li>&#13;
				<li>Canon EOS C200 — Canon Cinema RAW Light, DCI 4K, 24/25/30 fps 12-bit: <strong class="bold">1,000 Mbps</strong> o<span>r </span><span><strong class="bold">125 MB/s</strong></span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>As you can see, data rates vary widely, even on a single camera. The iPhone data rates are pretty low, which means details are sometimes lost in the compression process. If this could be an issue — and it probably is! — choose a third-party video recording app that allows higher data rates, or use a "real" camera instead. Broadly speaking, higher data rates will give a higher quality image and take up more space.</p>&#13;
			<p>The data rate isn't the only variable, however. Modern compression methods, such as HEVC, are more efficient than older ones, such as H.264; that's why Apple uses half the data rate for HEVC recording. However, that efficiency comes at a cost in that it's more difficult to decode, which is also true for some exotic flavors of H.264. For example, 10-bit files from a GH5 are much harder to work with than 8-bit files, Canon RAW Light is demanding even on high-end hardware, and GoPro footage isn't as smooth as Canon DSLR footage. Many Macs have additional HEVC-decoding hardware (the T2 chip), so your mileage will vary there, too.</p>&#13;
			<p>The good news is that most common formats recorded by most common cameras are easy for FCP X to decode. <em class="italic">You can work with most footage natively</em>, without any extra processing. As stated in <a href="B15343_02_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor044"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Before the Edit: Production Tips</em>, I'd strongly <a id="_idIndexMarker158"/>recommend testing original media from a <a id="_idIndexMarker159"/>camera<a id="_idIndexMarker160"/> before you buy it to make sure you can work with it easily. Your reward is the following simple workflow:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Import the origi<span>nal media.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Edit.</li>&#13;
				<li>Export.</li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>However, if you didn't choose the camera and your Mac is struggling to handle one or more clips, you can<strong class="bold"> transcode </strong>them, making an additional <strong class="bold">optimized</strong> copy of some or all of the files in the ProRes 422 codec.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-87"><a id="_idTextAnchor090"/>Understanding optimized media (ProRes 422)</h2>&#13;
			<p>ProRes 422 is <a id="_idIndexMarker161"/>an Apple-designed "mezzanine" codec<a id="_idIndexMarker162"/> that is relatively large, high-quality, and easy to edit. While most compressed camera codecs are <strong class="bold">inter-frame</strong>, describing their image data in relation to previous frames or even frames coming up soon, ProRes is an <strong class="bold">intra-frame</strong> codec, like a series of still images that don't refer to one another. This is less efficient and takes up more space, but it's much simpler for your Mac to work with. How much more space are we talking about?</p>&#13;
			<p>Well, while ProRes 422 is actually just one codec in a family of others (including ProRes 422 Proxy, ProRes 422 LT, ProRes 422, ProRes 422 HQ, ProRes 4444, and ProRes 4444 XQ), optimized footage uses the "vanilla" ProRes 422 codec. Regardless of the original camera, ProRes uses around the following amounts of data:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>ProRes 422 — 1080p, 24 fps: <strong class="bold">117 Mbps</strong> or<span> </span><span><strong class="bold">14.6 MB/s</strong></span></li>&#13;
				<li>ProRes 422 — UHD 4K, 24 fps: <strong class="bold">471 Mbps</strong> or<span> </span><span><strong class="bold">58.9 MB/s</strong></span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>ProRes 422 data rates are far higher than most camera-original data rates, but that's probably OK for smaller jobs. Optimized media will be stored in the Library, along with the original media, and as the original media is not deleted, you will need plenty of space. If you have that space, there's just one extra step in your workflow:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Import the origi<span>nal media.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Transcode<a id="_idIndexMarker163"/> some or all of the media to <a id="_idIndexMarker164"/>optimized media (Pr<span>oRes 422).</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Edit.</li>&#13;
				<li>Export.</li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>For longer jobs, optimized media might require terabytes of space that you don't have, and you might need to use a different approach: proxies.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-88"><a id="_idTextAnchor091"/>Understanding proxy media </h2>&#13;
			<p>While optimized<a id="_idIndexMarker165"/> files are a full-quality replacement for original<a id="_idIndexMarker166"/> media, proxy files are a medium-quality (and often lower-resolution) option that is only intended for use during the editing process. It'll look softer and possibly less pretty than you'd like, but that's fine while you're editing. Proxy media is quick to work with, and it doesn't take up nearly as much space as optimized media does. Previously, ProRes Proxy was the only way to go, at a data rate like this:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>ProRes Proxy — 1080p, 24fps: <strong class="bold">36 Mbps</strong> o<span>r </span><span><strong class="bold">4.5 MB/s</strong></span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p><em class="italic">From 10.4.9 onward</em>, you can choose to use the small, efficient H.264 codec, at the resolution of your choice. If you want to save a ton of space, you can use a frame size as small as 12.5% of the original file. It's still fast, and the process is much the same, but these files will be much smaller than a full- or half-size ProRes Proxy:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>H.264 — 1080p, 24fps: <strong class="bold">7.8 Mbps</strong><span> or </span><span><strong class="bold">1 MB/s</strong></span></li>&#13;
				<li>H.264 — 540p, 24fps: <strong class="bold">3 Mbps</strong> or <span><strong class="bold">0.375 MB/s</strong></span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Note that if proxies have <a id="_idIndexMarker167"/>been created and you want to change their resolution or codec, you'll have to<a id="_idIndexMarker168"/> delete them (with <strong class="bold">File</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Delete Generated Library Files</strong> or <strong class="bold">File</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Delete Generated Clip Files</strong>) before recreating them at a different size.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-89"><a id="_idTextAnchor092"/>Generating transcoded media</h2>&#13;
			<p>If you wish, transcoding (to<a id="_idIndexMarker169"/> optimized or proxy) can <a id="_idIndexMarker170"/>be performed on every file &#13;
you import:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Go to <strong class="bold">Final Cut Pro</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Pr</strong><span><strong class="bold">eferences</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Choose the <strong class="bold">Import</strong> icon at the top of the <strong class="bold">Preferenc</strong><span><strong class="bold">es </strong></span><span>dialog:</span><div id="_idContainer078" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_3.5_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 3.5: The Import dialog"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.5: The Imp<span>ort dialog</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Under <strong class="bold">Transcode</strong>, select the <strong class="bold">Create optimized media</strong> and/or <strong class="bold">Create proxy media</strong> checkboxes (and a proxy codec and size if needed) a<span>s desired.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>Note that checking these options will also check the matching buttons in the <strong class="bold">Import </strong>window, coming up soon.</p>&#13;
			<p>Another option, if most files play well in their original format, is to transcode some files on request:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">In the browser, select the files that you wish t<span>o convert.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Right-click and then choose <strong class="bold">Transc</strong><span><strong class="bold">ode Media</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>In the dialog that <a id="_idIndexMarker171"/>appears, select one or more of the checkboxes (and a proxy codec and <a id="_idIndexMarker172"/>size if needed) then<span> press </span><span><strong class="bold">OK</strong></span><span>:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer079" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.6_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 3.6: Here, only optimized media will be created"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.6: Here, only optimized media will <span>be created</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Most kinds of original media can be optimized, but ProRes, HDV, and DV footage cannot. MP3 audio files are converted into uncompressed formats automatically on import, so you can't optimize them manually either.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-90"><a id="_idTextAnchor093"/>Viewing proxy media</h2>&#13;
			<p>If you create proxy <a id="_idIndexMarker173"/>files, you also have to choose to <a id="_idIndexMarker174"/>view them. You can choose to view <strong class="bold">Optimized/Original</strong> files exclusively, proxy files exclusively with <strong class="bold">Proxy Only</strong>, or use <strong class="bold">Proxy Preferred</strong> (new in 10.4.9) to show proxy if available, and the original or optimized file if the proxy isn't available or hasn't yet been created. That last option is what you want while you're editing with proxies, and when you're done with the edit and before you export, switch back to the original quality media.</p>&#13;
			<p>To the workflow, then — if you can't work with the original media and an optimized version would be too big, this is the best way forward:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-91"><a id="_idTextAnchor094"/>Review — understanding original, optimized, and proxy footage</h2>&#13;
			<p>Let's <a id="_idIndexMarker177"/>take<a id="_idIndexMarker178"/> a quick<a id="_idIndexMarker179"/> recap of the recommended workflows:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Use original media if<span> possible.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>If the original media is too slow, generate optimized media if you have sufficient space, then edit and expor<span>t with it.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>If the original media is too slow and optimized media would be too big, generate proxy media, switch to viewing <strong class="bold">Proxy Preferred</strong> during editing, and switch back to <strong class="bold">Optimized/Original</strong> before <span>exporting.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>My personal preference is to shoot with cameras that I can work with natively. Transcoding takes time and space, and if you can combine the right camera with a modern Mac, you'll rarely need to do it. When I do use formats that don't play back smoothly, transcoding<a id="_idIndexMarker180"/> a few files isn't a big<a id="_idIndexMarker181"/> deal. If you're using higher-end <a id="_idIndexMarker182"/>cameras or collaborating, proxy files are likely to be part of the mix, and that's OK. There's room in this industry for all kinds of workflows.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-92"><a id="_idTextAnchor095"/>Importing media in different ways</h1>&#13;
			<p>While it's not <a id="_idIndexMarker183"/>instantly obvious, there are a couple of ways to import files into FCP X, with subtle differences between them. Some cameras can only be imported while others produce files that can be dragged and dropped instead, and it's good to be aware of the benefits of each approach. First off, let's keep it simple, with the giant, obvious, built-in <strong class="bold">Import </strong>feature, and then we'll come back to the more freeform drag and drop alternative.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-93"><a id="_idTextAnchor096"/>The Import window</h2>&#13;
			<p>A simple import is a<a id="_idIndexMarker184"/> great way to get started, and it can be accessed in three ways:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Firstly, by going to <strong class="bold">File</strong><span> &gt; </span><span><strong class="bold">Import</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Alternatively, by clicking on the downward-facing arrow <strong class="bold">Import Media</strong> button in the top-left in the bar at the top of the <span>interface:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer080" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.7_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 3.7: In full-screen mode, the Import button will be alone in the very top-left corner"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.7: In full-screen mode, the Import button will be alone in the very top-l<span>eft corner</span></p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Lastly, if an Event is empty, click on the <strong class="bold">Import Media</strong> button in the middle of the bro<span>wser pane:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer081" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.8_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 3.8: This button disappears after the first clip has been imported"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.8: This button disappears after the first clip has bee<span>n imported</span></p>&#13;
			<p>All of these options<a id="_idIndexMarker185"/> open up the <strong class="bold">Import </strong>window, which allows you to import files from connected devices, including the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Connect<span>ed iPhones</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Your Mac's built-in webcam, if <span>it has one</span></li>&#13;
				<li>SD cards and other media sto<span>rage cards</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Attached hard drives where files have b<span>een copied</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Camera archives, where media storage cards have been <span>duplicated</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Here's what the <strong class="bold">Import </strong>window looks like with an SD card from a Panasonic camera inserted and an iPhone connected and unlocked:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer082" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.9_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 3.9: The Import window, with drives on the left, options on the right, and files in the middle"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.9: The Import window, with drives on the left, options on the right, and files in <span>the middle</span></p>&#13;
			<p>In the top-left corner<a id="_idIndexMarker186"/> of the window, you'll see connected cameras and SD cards, and below that, you'll see the connected hard drives and favorite locations. Clicking on one of these displays the device or folder's media in the center pane of the window.</p>&#13;
			<p>In the bottom-right corner of that central pane are two buttons, which control how the videos are shown:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer083" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.10_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 3.10: The toggle button on the left indicates what you'll get if you click it, not the current state"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.10: The toggle button on the left indicates what you'll get if you click it, not the cur<span>rent state</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The left button is a toggle between two options: the <strong class="bold">Filmstrip</strong> view and the <strong class="bold">List</strong> view.</p>&#13;
			<p>The right-hand side filmstrip icon shows the <strong class="bold">Clip Appearance and Filtering</strong> popup with a couple of checkboxes, and in the <strong class="bold">Filmstrip </strong>view, sliders are also shown to govern the size of the <a id="_idIndexMarker187"/>clips and the length of time that each thumbnail represents:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer084" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.11_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 3.11: In Filmstrip mode, the top two sliders govern the clip's height and width"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.11: In Filmstrip mode, the top two sliders govern the clip's height<span> and width</span></p>&#13;
			<p>These two views are also used in the browser and are worth examining. The <strong class="bold">Filmstrip </strong>view, when zoomed in, can show every frame of a video at a glance:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer085" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.12_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 3.12: 2 seconds per thumbnail shows you how the jellyfish moves around throughout the clip"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.12: 2 seconds per thumbnail shows you how the jellyfish moves around throughou<span>t the clip</span></p>&#13;
			<p>By setting the menu<a id="_idIndexMarker188"/> to <strong class="bold">2s</strong>, each thumbnail frame in the filmstrip shows a frame representing 2 seconds of video, and, of course, this thumbnail duration can be adjusted either way. Without this feature, you'd have to view the clip manually at high speed, watching for the subject (a jellyfish, in this case) to appear in the frame.</p>&#13;
			<p>This is a huge timesaver for many kinds of footage and in fact, this filmstrip-based approach was created by Randy Ubillos (the creator of the original version of Premiere, the original FCP, iMovie, and FCP X) after scrubbing through long diving videos looking for sharks.</p>&#13;
			<p>The <strong class="bold">List</strong> view shows a more traditional column-based browser, with just a single selected clip's filmstrip above it. The length of the clip is set by the width of the pane, and so the thumbnail duration can't be adjusted in this mode. The <strong class="bold">List </strong>view is most useful in two scenarios — when the thumbnails don't change much, as in an interview, or when you want to view or sort by more information about the clips, such as the date or duration:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer086" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.13_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 3.13: The List view, which is ideal when you want to see metadata such as the date and duration"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.13: The List view, which is ideal when you want to see metadata such as the date an<span>d duration</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Column headers can <a id="_idIndexMarker189"/>be clicked on to sort by that criterion, and right-clicking on a column header allows the columns to be customized. But there will be more on that in the next chapter.</p>&#13;
			<p>Both the <strong class="bold">Filmstrip </strong>view and the <strong class="bold">List </strong>view include a <strong class="bold">Viewer</strong> at the top of the pane, with the current frame visible. A video can be played back with the button at the bottom of the Viewer here, but it's easiest just to press the spacebar to play or pause.</p>&#13;
			<p>These concepts are repeated, with a similar interface, in the browser. As I'll be showing you that in the next chapter, I'll keep things simple for now. With a few exceptions, I only use the <strong class="bold">Import </strong>window <a id="_idIndexMarker190"/>to discover which clips I'm going to import, and the usual answer is <em class="italic">all of them</em>. You will be able to do a much better job of sorting, selecting, and deleting once you've imported your clips, so don't spend too long here. Instead, follow these steps to select the clips you want to import:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Choose the <strong class="bold">Filmstrip</strong> view or <strong class="bold">List</strong> view with the togg<span>le button.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Use the <strong class="bold">Clip Appearance and Filtering </strong>menu or the columns to adjust or sort<span> the view.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Click once on the first clip you want <span>to import.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Hold the <strong class="bold">⇧</strong> key, then click once on the last clip that you want <span>to import.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>If you can quickly see that there are clips you don't want, such as a brief accidental recording, hold the <strong class="bold">⌘</strong> key and click once on each of those clips to remove them from the <span>selection.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Similarly, if you can see additional unselected clips that you do want to import, hold the <strong class="bold">⌘</strong> key and click once on each of those clips to ad<span>d them to </span>&#13;
the <span>selection.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>Great! You've selected all of the clips you want to import. But don't press the <strong class="bold">Import </strong>button yet — we need to <em class="italic">check the settings in the right-hand pane first</em>. They should look something like this:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer087" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.14_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 3.14: The right-hand side of the Import dialog governs many settings"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.14: The right-hand side of the Import dialog governs man<span>y settings</span></p>&#13;
			<p>At the top, you can use <a id="_idIndexMarker191"/>a drop-down menu to choose which Event, in any currently open Library, you'd like to import the footage to. If you'd like to create a new Event, you can do that instead by clicking on <strong class="bold">Create new event in:</strong> and choosing a Library from the menu.</p>&#13;
			<p>Below that, you'll see a critical choice: <strong class="bold">Copy to library</strong> or <strong class="bold">Leave files in place</strong>. This is a separate setting to <strong class="bold">Media Storage Location</strong>, which we discussed earlier, but <strong class="bold">Leave files in place</strong> has a similar outcome: the media is left outside the Library and is not copied or moved at all. If you're new to FCP X, don't use this option — it's for more advanced workflows:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer088" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.15_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 3.15: The choice to leave files in place is not available if you're importing from a phone or a camera"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.15: The choice to leave files in place is not available if you're importing from a phone o<span>r a camera</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Luckily, you can't go wrong if you're importing from a device that FCP X thinks is a camera. When you import from an iPhone or a media card, the files must be copied (for safety and speed reasons) and can't be left in place. Note that <strong class="bold">Leave files in place </strong>will be available if you're importing from a regular hard drive, but don't choose it yet.</p>&#13;
			<p>Audio Roles are important and are covered later in this chapter, as well as later in this book. For now, simply leave these options at their defaults.</p>&#13;
			<p><strong class="bold">Transcoding</strong>, as <a id="_idIndexMarker192"/>discussed earlier, can be applied by checking one or both of the following checkboxes in the pane. If you know that you need to use optimized or proxy media, go ahead and click whichever option applies, but if you don't know that for sure, leave them both unchecked.</p>&#13;
			<p>Similarly, I recommend leaving the <strong class="bold">Analyze</strong> and <strong class="bold">Fix</strong> checkboxes unchecked as well. If you do want to automatically organize clips and/or apply quick auto-fixes, then you can do that later.</p>&#13;
			<p>Note that changes to any of these settings are persistent; the matching <strong class="bold">Import</strong> pane in <strong class="bold">Preferences</strong> will reflect any changes made in the <strong class="bold">Impo</strong><strong class="bold">rt </strong>window.</p>&#13;
			<p>When you have these settings as you want them, look to the bottom of the window and you will see an <strong class="bold">Import Selected</strong> button (if you have selected one or more clips) or <strong class="bold">Import All</strong> (if you have selected nothing). Click on the <strong class="bold">Import Selected</strong> or <strong class="bold">Import All </strong>button to begin the import process:</p>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">&#13;
</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer089" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.16_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 3.16: You'll see Import All with nothing selected, or Import Selected with any clips selected"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.16: You'll see Import All with nothing selected, or Import Selected with any clip<span>s selected</span></p>&#13;
			<p>If <strong class="bold">Close window after starting import</strong> is chosen, the <strong class="bold">Import</strong> window will disappear, and normally this is fine. If you want to import from several different locations at once, however, you can uncheck this box, choose the next batch of clips, and then close the window yourself.</p>&#13;
			<p>As soon as the import begins, all the clips chosen in the <strong class="bold">Import</strong> window will be instantly shown in the browser. They haven't actually been copied yet although (amazingly!) they can be played back, reviewed, and organized. However, for maximum efficiency, it's best to allow the import process to finish before viewing the videos. If you scrub through clips that haven't yet been copied, you'll slow down or even pause the copying process.</p>&#13;
			<p>In the browser, clips <a id="_idIndexMarker193"/>that are being copied, or are about to be copied, will display an icon in the bottom-left corner:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer090" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.17_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 3.17: During the import process, you'll see icons appear, spin to completion, and then disappear"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.17: During the import process, you'll see icons appear, spin to completion, and then<span> disappear</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The following are the icons that appear when the clips are being copied:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>No icon (as in the first clip) indicates that the clip has finished copying to th<span>e Library.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>A circular clock icon (as in the second clip) indicates that the clip is currently being copied, and the progress of the clock indicates how far al<span>ong it is.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>An empty gray circle icon (as in the other clips) indicates that a clip has not yet been copied, but is in <span>the queue.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Note that a circular dashed icon in the top-left corner of a thumbnail indicates that this clip was recorded at a high frame rate, enabling high-quality slow motion.</p>&#13;
			<p>A similar clock icon <a id="_idIndexMarker194"/>indicating the progress of the whole import is shown in the top-left corner of the interface:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer091" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.18_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 3.18: The clock icon here will become a checkmark when the import is complete"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.18: The clock icon here will become a checkmark when the import i<span>s complete</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Pressing this button opens up a separate <strong class="bold">Background Tasks</strong> window, showing more information about not just the Import process, but also any additional analysis or transcoding options that were selected:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer092" class="figure">&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.19: For more detail, click the disclosure triangle to the left of any acti<span>ve section</span></p>&#13;
			<p>This window will also be informative during the <strong class="bold">Share/Export</strong> process, which is discussed in the final <a id="_idIndexMarker195"/>chapter of this book.</p>&#13;
			<p>When the import is complete, which could take anywhere from a few seconds to many minutes, a notification will appear in the top-right corner of the display. If you know you don't need to import anything else from this device, click <strong class="bold">Eject</strong>:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer093" class="figure">&#13;

			<p>Before you physically remove an SD card, also verify that it's no longer visible in the Finder; otherwise, you'll be warned about safely ejecting volumes. Ejecting a phone with media that hasn't yet<a id="_idIndexMarker196"/> been fully imported might also cause FCP X to crash.</p>&#13;
			<p>So far, so simple. However, there's another method for importing your media that doesn't have to be complex and enables some additional workflows.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-94"><a id="_idTextAnchor097"/>Importing via drag and drop</h3>&#13;
			<p>You don't have to<a id="_idIndexMarker197"/> use the <strong class="bold">Import </strong>window at all. Instead, <em class="italic">it's possible </em>— <em class="italic">and safe </em>— <em class="italic">to drag and drop media</em> files directly from the Finder into FCP X. However, this is only a recommended workflow if you are working with a camera that creates self-contained files, such as <strong class="source-inline">.mov</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">.mp4</strong>, and even <strong class="source-inline">.r3d</strong>. As discussed in <a href="B15343_02_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor044"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Before the Edit: Production Tips</em>, if your camera uses the AVCHD format, then you should use the <strong class="bold">Import </strong>window instead. Common DSLR and mirrorless cameras create self-contained files, and I prefer to use drag and drop most of the time.</p>&#13;
			<p>To import this way, it's vital to open <strong class="bold">Preferences </strong>and set the options in the <strong class="bold">Import </strong>pane first, because those are the settings that are used when you drag and drop to import. For now, do the following:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Go to <strong class="bold">Final Cut Pro</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Preferences</strong>, then choose the <strong class="bold">Im</strong><span><strong class="bold">port</strong></span><span> pane.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Make sure <strong class="bold">Copy to library storage location</strong> <span>is chosen:</span><div id="_idContainer094" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_3.21_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 3.21: The Preferences pane uses a more compact layout for these Import options"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.21: The Preferences pane uses a more compact layout for these Impo<span>rt options</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Now, find and<a id="_idIndexMarker198"/> select the files you want to import using t<span>he Finder:</span><div id="_idContainer095" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_3.22_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 3.22: In the Finder, I've applied colored tags to clips imported in separate batches"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.22: In the Finder, I've applied colored tags to clips imported in separa<span>te batches</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Finally, drag these <a id="_idIndexMarker199"/>clips to the FCP X window <em class="italic">directly to an Event</em> (not a Library). If you have already selected an Event (not a Library), you can also drag to the larger browser area to the right of the Ev<span>ent names.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>So, why import this way? Simply, it can be more convenient to open and find clips using the Finder. If you know that you want to import everything you've just shot like I do, you don't need the extra viewing power of the <strong class="bold">Import </strong>window. Also, if you can see the clips you want to import in the Finder, there's no need to find those clips again through the <strong class="bold">Import </strong>window — just throw them in. For better or worse, drag and drop also skips over any subtle file rewrapping operations that FCP X might perform when using the <strong class="bold">Impo</strong><strong class="bold">rt </strong>window.</p>&#13;
			<p>This method also allows some very nice workflows if you're importing to a laptop while in the field, including some great ways to make sure you never skip a clip. In the preceding screenshot, you can see that I've added tags (blue and orange dots) to selected clips. My recommended workflow is as follows:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Select any new <a id="_idIndexMarker200"/>clips by clicking on the first clip and then <strong class="bold">⇧-clicking</strong><span> the last.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Right-click and apply a colored tag to these clips. If this isn't the first import, choose a differe<span>nt color. </span></li>&#13;
				<li>Drag and drop these clips<span> to FCP X.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>Working with tags has several benefits:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>You won't miss a clip when importing the next batch — the previous clips are  already co<span>lor-coded.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>With the default <strong class="bold">Import </strong>options, the color tags will become keywords that can be renamed. Keywords are discussed in the next chapter and are ve<span>ry useful.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>If you're working with a second camera, you can use the tags to differentiate between multiple cameras, scenes, or types of shots — anything<span> you like.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Next up, we will look at managing storage space.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-95"><a id="_idTextAnchor098"/>Managing storage space</h3>&#13;
			<p>With or without <a id="_idIndexMarker201"/>tags, any files you import will be copied to the Library storage location that you chose earlier. If <strong class="bold">In Library</strong> is chosen, then they'll be stored in whatever drive the Library is in. Importantly, the Library now contains all of the files you need, and the original copies of those files are no longer needed or referenced.</p>&#13;
			<p>To be clear, if you import directly from a camera media card into a Library using FCP X, the process is extremely simple, works well, and there is no unnecessary duplication. This is the way I prefer to work, and the way I recommend most people to work.</p>&#13;
			<p>However, some people prefer to maintain more direct control over video files in the Finder. Without access to FCP X in the field, an operator might just copy the camera's media to a hard drive, then give you the files on a portable hard drive. That's OK — treat that portable hard drive like a media card, and import the files directly from it.</p>&#13;
			<p>The one benefit of this workflow is that if the files have been organized into folders and/or subfolders within them, these will become Keywords on the clips. This can be a helpful starting point, but the capabilities of Keywords can go way beyond folders. As mentioned earlier, Keywords are discussed in the next chapter.</p>&#13;
			<p>However, <em class="italic">don't just copy the media files to your main working drive first</em>! If you copy video files to your main working drive and then import them to a Library on that same drive, you're duplicating the media and wasting space. Backups are important, but duplicates need to live on separate drives to be useful.</p>&#13;
			<p>There is a way forward that allows an editor to manually manage their media and avoid duplication, but it's dangerous. The <strong class="bold">Leave files in place</strong> option, found in the <strong class="bold">Import</strong> window and the <strong class="bold">Import </strong>pane of <strong class="bold">Preferences</strong>, doesn't copy anything but instead points to the media wherever it is on a drive. While there are definitely more advanced workflows that rely on manually managing media, if you're just learning about FCP X, you should stay far away from this.</p>&#13;
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Leave files in place</strong> workflow demands much more of you as an editor because you have to manage the location of the media as well as the Library. It becomes more difficult to move a Library between hard drives, and you run the risk of having to relink media down the line. In short, there's plenty that can go wrong, so <em class="italic">don't leave files in place without a go</em><em class="italic">od reason</em>.</p>&#13;
			<p>A few good reasons to use the <strong class="bold">Leave files in place</strong> workflow are as follows:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>You're collaborating with other editors on a local server with a more complex media storage<span> workflow.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>You're using Postlab or another collaboration solution that manages media in it<span>s own way.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>You frequently need to send a "lean" Library (without media) to anoth<span>er editor.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>However, if you're<a id="_idIndexMarker202"/> working alone on a one-off job on a local hard drive, you'll only give yourself extra work. Trust FCP X and store media in a Library.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-96"><a id="_idTextAnchor099"/>Using camera archives</h2>&#13;
			<p>There's one more <a id="_idIndexMarker203"/>workflow that the <strong class="bold">Import </strong>window enables, and while most people don't need it, there are some good reasons to consider it when working with &#13;
certain cameras.</p>&#13;
			<p>When an SD card is inserted or a camera is directly connected, the bottom-left corner of the <strong class="bold">Import </strong>window contains a button: <strong class="bold">Create Archive</strong>. Pressing this brings up a dialog where you can choose where to save an exact copy of the entire file structure of a media card. This obviously takes up a lot of space and can be redundant if you have another backup strategy in place. So, if your camera records to standalone files and you use the drag and drop import method, camera archives probably aren't something you'll need. Still, they do enable a sometimes-handy workflow: reimporting missing media.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-97"><a id="_idTextAnchor100"/>Reimporting media</h2>&#13;
			<p>If you cancel an<a id="_idIndexMarker204"/> import or an import fails due to a crash or a media drive being ejected, you can be left in an odd position: clips appear to be present, but the real media is still on the camera or SD card. You can tell that this has happened by checking for a small camera icon in the bottom-left corner of a clip:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer096" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.23_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 3.23: If you see this camera warning, something went wrong with the import process"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.23: If you see this camera warning, something went wrong with the impo<span>rt process</span></p>&#13;
			<p>That's a big warning — if that card or camera is ejected, the thumbnail will show a red <strong class="bold">Missing Camera </strong>icon and message and the clip will be unusable:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer097" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.24_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 3.24: Nobody wants to see this red background with a warning symbol"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.24: Nobody wants to see this red background with a warn<span>ing symbol</span></p>&#13;
			<p>To recover from <a id="_idIndexMarker205"/>this problem, do the following:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Connect the camera or SD card that the me<span>dia is on.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Go to <strong class="bold">File</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Import</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Reimport from Camer</strong><span><strong class="bold">a/Archive</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>Most of the time, the camera is still available, and this process is straightforward. However, if the media has been erased, you've lost the clip. <em class="italic">Don't erase your camera cards until you're sure they've been imported safely, and they've been backed up twice</em>. Camera archives can be a handy backup solution for the original media, but I prefer to simply back up my entire main media drive to another local drive, and use automatic online backup for my whole system.</p>&#13;
			<p>If you've used external media that's gone missing, the command you'll need to reconnect it is <strong class="bold">File</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Relink Files</strong>. Simply keep your media inside the Library and you'll never need to do this, but <a id="_idIndexMarker206"/>you can read more about it in <a href="B15343_10_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor271"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">Explore a Little: Compound Clips and Timeli</em><em class="italic">ne Tricks</em>.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-98"><a id="_idTextAnchor101"/>Importing from iMovie</h2>&#13;
			<p>If you're <a id="_idIndexMarker207"/>stepping up to FCP X from iMovie, you'll <a id="_idIndexMarker208"/>be pleased to know that you can transfer your edits pretty easily. Here's how the process works on your iPhone or iPad:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Open iMovie, then tap once on the Project that you want to<span> transfer.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press the <strong class="bold">Share</strong> button at the bottom, then click on <strong class="bold">Expor</strong><span><strong class="bold">t Project</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>On the next sheet, choose a method (such as AirDrop) to get the Project to<span> your Mac.</span><p>AirDrop is the easiest option to use if your Mac and iOS devices are on the same Wi-Fi network and AirDrop is open in the Finder on your Mac.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>With the Project now on your Mac, go to <strong class="bold">File</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Import</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">iMovie iOS Projects</strong>, then locate the <strong class="source-inline">.iMovieMobile</strong> file and click on <strong class="bold">Import</strong>. (If you used AirDrop, this file will be in <strong class="bold">D</strong><span><strong class="bold">ownloads</strong></span><span>.)</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>A new Event will now be created, within which you'll see a Project and all of your media clips.</p>&#13;
			<p>Moving from iMovie on the Mac to FCP X on the same Mac is even easier:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Select the Event containing the clips and Project you want to move<span> to FCP X.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">File</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Send Event to Fina</strong><span><strong class="bold">l Cut Pro</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>A new Event is now created in a new Library.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-99"><a id="_idTextAnchor102"/>Review — importing media in different ways</h2>&#13;
			<p>You now know<a id="_idIndexMarker209"/> how to use the Import window, how to drag and drop, how to re-import from a Camera Archive, and how to move across from iMovie. But because it's really important, let's recap where your media files are stored.</p>&#13;
			<p>After you create a Library, give it a sensible name, and choose where to save it, there's a simple workflow to follow:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Set your Library's media storage location to <strong class="bold">I</strong><span><strong class="bold">n Library</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Import with <strong class="bold">Copy to library storage locatio</strong><span><strong class="bold">n</strong></span><span> checked.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>This always works, and the worst that can happen is that your Libraries can get pretty large. A power-user alternative you might never need is as follows:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Set a Library's media storage location to an extern<span>al folder.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Import with <strong class="bold">Copy to library storage locatio</strong><span><strong class="bold">n</strong></span><span> checked.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>In this scenario, FCP X manages your media but copies it to a folder outside the Library. This means you have to manage multiple folders (boo!) but keeps the Library relatively small (yay!). Things can still go wrong if you're not careful, and some advanced workflows are <a id="_idIndexMarker210"/>possible. Another way is as follows:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Set a Library's media storage location to <strong class="bold">In Library</strong> or an external folder — it doesn't real<span>ly matter.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Import with <strong class="bold">Leave files in plac</strong><span><strong class="bold">e</strong></span><span> checked.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>In this last workflow, you have to manage your video files completely on your own. Plenty of things can go wrong, but the most advanced workflows are possible. Whichever way you go, be conscious of your choice and stay organized. Speaking of which, if your production used more than one camera or multiple microphones, now's the time to join those files together.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-100"><a id="_idTextAnchor103"/>Syncing media from multiple devices</h1>&#13;
			<p>If your production <a id="_idIndexMarker211"/>was recorded using multiple devices, either with multiple video cameras or a video camera and a separate audio recorder, you'll want to sync up any media files that belong together. If you've shot with a single camera and a separate audio device, you might choose to make a <strong class="bold">Synchronized Clip</strong>. But for two or more video angles or multiple audio sources, you should use a <strong class="bold">Mult</strong><strong class="bold">icam Clip</strong>.</p>&#13;
			<p>The process for making either of these two clip types is similar and usually relies on similar audio being recorded on each of these devices. If this is not possible, there are other syncing methods available, including timecode, and you can always manually sync if needed. As mentioned in <a href="B15343_02_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor044"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Before the Edit: Production Tips</em>, the best way to make sure that <a id="_idIndexMarker212"/>the audio works as a synchronization method is to make loud noises on camera. A loud action that is both visible and audible to all devices, such as clapping a classic clapperboard, is best.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-101"><a id="_idTextAnchor104"/>Creating synchronized clips</h2>&#13;
			<p>When you just<a id="_idIndexMarker213"/> have a single audio <a id="_idIndexMarker214"/>source and a single video source, you just need to select them at the same time with a quick <strong class="bold">⇧-click</strong> or <strong class="bold">⌘-click</strong>:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Select the matching audio and video clips at the same time in th<span>e browser.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Right-click on one of the selected clips, then choose <strong class="bold">Synchroni</strong><span><strong class="bold">ze Clips…</strong></span><span>:</span><div id="_idContainer098" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_3.25_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 3.25: Synchronizing clips is good for a single video and audio source"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.25: Synchronizing clips is good for a single video and au<span>dio source</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>In the sheet that appears, choose these default options and<span> press </span><span><strong class="bold">OK</strong></span><span>:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer099" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.26_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 3.26: Default options will sync using audio, then mute the camera's audio"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.26: Default options will sync using audio, then mute the came<span>ra's audio</span></p>&#13;
			<p>With only a single video source, this operation is straightforward. The new Synchronized Clip will combine using the audio from the external recorder and the video from the camera, synced to the <a id="_idIndexMarker215"/>audio that the video<a id="_idIndexMarker216"/> camera recorded. If the audio is out of sync, the camera didn't record good audio. But how can you tell? Double-click on the Synchronized Clip and it will open in the <strong class="bold">Time</strong><strong class="bold">line</strong> pane.</p>&#13;
			<p>If synced audio has been detected, <em class="italic">the two clips will start at different points</em> because one of them will have been moved to match the other. If the starting points match, that means no sync was detected or you started recording on both devices at exactly the same time (which is unlikely).</p>&#13;
			<p>Look at the waveforms of the video and audio clips. If you can see that the audio from the video (on top) and the standalone audio (below) have the same peaks in the same places, you're done. This real-world clip is a good example, showing a slightly earlier start for the audio and clear matching peaks on both clips:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer100" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.27_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 3.27: Two waveforms in sync, with one clip moved to match the other"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.27: Two waveforms in sync, with one clip moved to match<span> the other</span></p>&#13;
			<p>If the two clips are out of sync, simply move the audio clip until the two waveforms match up. Zooming in (<strong class="bold">⌘plus</strong>) helps, as do the <strong class="bold">comma</strong> and <strong class="bold">period</strong> keys, which nudge a clip by a single frame left or right.</p>&#13;
			<p>When you're <a id="_idIndexMarker217"/>done, you'll be able to edit <a id="_idIndexMarker218"/>with a Synchronized Clip in the same way as a regular clip — but it'll sound better. However, if you prefer, you can skip over Synchronized Clips entirely and create Multicam Clips instead.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-102"><a id="_idTextAnchor105"/>Creating multicam clips</h2>&#13;
			<p>Multicam clips combine <a id="_idIndexMarker219"/>several angles, including <a id="_idIndexMarker220"/>as many video and audio angles as you wish, into a single clip. Later in the book, in <a href="B15343_09_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor253"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Consider Your Options: Multicam, Replacing, and Auditions</em>, you'll discover how to work with these files, but for now, we'll just create them.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">More than anything else, decoding multiple angles of large multicam footage is likely to strain your computer, and there's a preference, on by default, to make multicam playback easier. In <strong class="bold">Final Cut Pro</strong> &gt;<strong class="bold"> Preferences</strong>, in the Playback pane, you'll see a checkbox named <strong class="bold">Create optimized media for multicam clips</strong>. If checked, it will create Optimized media, even if this transcoding on import was disabled. While this increases playback performance, it can also create very large files, especially for longer multicam jobs.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">If you're only working with a couple of angles of H.264 footage on a moderately powerful Mac, you can probably turn this off. However, if you experience stuttering during playback, you can turn this on and wait while the Optimized media is prepared. Alternatively, transcode this media to Proxy and use a Proxy workflow instead.</p>&#13;
			<p>For a simple multicam session with a couple of clips, the process of creating a Multicam Clip is very similar to creating a Synchronized Clip, but if any devices were stopped and started during multicam recording, you should go through a few extra steps first. At the end of the process, each audio or video device will become an "angle," and to help that along, it's a good idea to manually assign camera name or camera angle information to all of the clips you <a id="_idIndexMarker221"/>want to combine. Here's a practical <a id="_idIndexMarker222"/>example of how to apply this from a recent job of mine:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer101" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.28_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 3.28: The names in the clips tell you which camera each file came from, but you should add a camera name or angle, too"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.28: The names in the clips tell you which camera each file came from, but you should add a camera name or <span>angle, too</span></p>&#13;
			<p>I recorded on two video cameras (set to different filename prefixes of <strong class="source-inline">PIA</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">PIB</strong>) and two audio recorders. Each audio recorder was left to run for over 120 minutes, while the video cameras were stopped and started periodically. Pausing and restarting recording is a good idea for two reasons: it allows batteries to be changed and though one camera was connected to mains power, if the power had failed, the entire clip up to that point could have been lost. Ending a recording finalizes the current clip and protects against corruption. </p>&#13;
			<p>With all of the clips imported into the browser and the <strong class="bold">List </strong>view shown, you'll see that there's a <strong class="bold">Camera Name</strong> column of data. That's what we want to add to, and while you can click and type directly into that column in the browser, it's easier to use the <strong class="bold">Inspector </strong>window. The process for this is as follows:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">In the Browser, select all the clips from a sin<span>gle angle.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Inspector </strong>window, choose<a id="_idIndexMarker223"/> the <strong class="bold">Info</strong> icon (a small circle with an <strong class="bold">i </strong>symbol inside) to <a id="_idIndexMarker224"/>switch to the<span> </span><span><strong class="bold">Info</strong></span><span> tab:</span><div id="_idContainer102" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_3.29_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 3.29: The Info tab shows all kinds of metadata, including the Camera Name"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.29: The Info tab shows all kinds of metadata, including the C<span>amera Name</span></p><p>Metadata is "data<a id="_idIndexMarker225"/> about data" and the <a id="_idIndexMarker226"/>camera records lots of it, including the date of recording, the filename, and plenty more. To make it easier to view just some of the metadata, several different metadata views are available. </p></li>&#13;
				<li>From the bottom-left corner of this pane, choose <strong class="bold">Basic</strong> from the menu if it's not already<span> selected.</span>&#13;
<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p><p class="callout">If you would prefer to use <strong class="bold">Camera Angle</strong> rather than <strong class="bold">Camera Name</strong>, you should switch from the <strong class="bold">Basic</strong> metadata view to <strong class="bold">General</strong> to see that field. Either is fine for our purposes here.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>We're now going to add something that the camera didn't know:</p></li>&#13;
				<li>For <strong class="bold">Camera Name</strong>, change<a id="_idIndexMarker227"/> the <a id="_idIndexMarker228"/>value to <strong class="source-inline">A</strong>, representing the "A camera," and pre<span>ss Return.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Return to the Browser and select the clips from the oth<span>er camera.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Inspector </strong>window, for <strong class="bold">Camera Name</strong>, change the value to <strong class="source-inline">B</strong>, representing the "B camera," and pre<span>ss Return.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Repeat these steps for your other devices, such as microphones, giving each one a us<span>eful name.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>You should now see something like this in the <strong class="bold">Camera Na</strong><strong class="bold">me </strong>column:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer103" class="figure">&#13;

			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">If you use the <strong class="bold">Import </strong>window, the name of the SD card is used as the camera name.

				<li value="1">Click on all of the speaker icons to make all of the angles audibl<span>e at once:</span><div id="_idContainer107" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_3.34_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 3.34: The blue speaker icons let you know whether you can hear a clip"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.34: The blue speaker icons let you know whether you can h<span>ear a clip</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Press the <strong class="bold"><a id="_idIndexMarker243"/></strong><strong class="bold">spacebar</strong> to <a id="_idIndexMarker244"/>playback <a id="_idIndexMarker245"/>everythin<span>g </span><span><a id="_idIndexMarker246"/></span><span>at once.</span><p>If anything's out of sync, you'll need to move it back.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>As before, zoom in (<strong class="bold">⌘plus</strong>) to see any details, then use the comma and period keys to nudge a clip by a single frame left<span> or right.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>To make larger moves, the easiest way is to simply grab any clips in the wrong place and drag them sideways until the waveforms match up. (If this doesn't work, make sure you're using the <strong class="bold">Position </strong>tool by pr<span>essing </span><span><strong class="bold">P</strong></span><span>.)</span><p>There's a subtlety here, however — hovering over a single angle will only play that angle's video and audio.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Hover over the timeline's ruler and press the <strong class="bold">spacebar</strong> to play the current video angle and all of the active aud<span>io angles.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>There are additional controls hidden in a small menu to the right of each angle's name. From there, you can resync selected clips to the currently chosen video angle &#13;
(the monitoring angle), but in most cases, this won't be necessary.</p>&#13;
			<p>That's just about all you need to know about preparing multicams. This multicam Angle Editor is very handy, but it's not something you usually need to mess around with much after this initial <a id="_idIndexMarker247"/>setup phase. Instead, you'll <a id="_idIndexMarker248"/>use standard timeline <a id="_idIndexMarker249"/>controls alongside the Angle Viewer, which is discussed in a later<a id="_idIndexMarker250"/> chapter. If you do dive back in with a multicam, remember that adjusting it here will affect all instances of that multicam throughout the Library, so it is an operation to perform with caution.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-104"><a id="_idTextAnchor107"/>Review — syncing media from multiple devices</h2>&#13;
			<p>Synchronized Clips are handy, but Multicam Clips are more commonly used and are more powerful. Later in<a id="_idIndexMarker251"/> this book, you'll discover how to use these container formats to perform sneaky behind-the-scenes replacements, but for now, just know that you should combine any simultaneously recorded media. Select it, right-click, create a Synchronized or Multicam Clip, double-click to edit, and resync if necessary — and that's it. The last thing on the agenda is to understand what Roles can do for you.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-105"><a id="_idTextAnchor108"/>Understanding and applying Roles</h1>&#13;
			<p>Roles provide a<a id="_idIndexMarker252"/> way to categorize your video clips based on how <a id="_idIndexMarker253"/>they will be used in video or audio terms: <strong class="bold">Music</strong>, <strong class="bold">Dialogue</strong>, <strong class="bold">Sound Effects</strong>, <strong class="bold">Titles</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Video</strong>. You can go crazy and define your own Video and Audio Roles, or you can use the built-in Roles that I just listed. Each Role can be further split into Subroles, so a Role named <strong class="bold">Dialogue </strong>could have Subroles named for each of the languages you plan to support. Even more amazingly, if you have a high-end, multi-track audio recorder with iXML support, you can name its inputs <a id="_idIndexMarker254"/>on the device and they'll be mapped to Roles <a id="_idIndexMarker255"/>automatically — magic:</p>&#13;

				<div id="_idContainer108" class="figure">&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.35: The default Roles include the basics — add more i<span>f you wish</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The power of Roles is seen during the editing process, where the Roles decide the color of each clip. Audio is deemed more important than video here, and the color of a clip's Audio Role takes precedence. Therefore, if a clip has usable audio and video, it's a good idea to assign Roles based on its audio content. Any sound effects or music that you add will be tagged with the appropriate Role, but if you want to get fancy and define additional Roles, now is the time. Roles are best applied to clips before they're used in an edit.</p>&#13;
			<p>If you have imported additional music tracks (via the import or drag-and-drop options), then you should do the following:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Right-click, then choose <strong class="bold">Assign Audio Role</strong><span><strong class="bold">s</strong></span><span> &gt; </span><span><strong class="bold">Music</strong></span><span>.</span><p>Most of the clips that you have imported will be tagged as <strong class="bold">Video </strong>for the Video Role and <strong class="bold">Dialogue </strong>for the Audio Role.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>If some of your clips will be used as sound effects or music, <strong class="bold">assign those Audio </strong><span><strong class="bold">Roles now</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>If you plan to make <a id="_idIndexMarker256"/>use of screenshots, different classes of<a id="_idIndexMarker257"/> video, such as presentation media, or special media, such as super slow motion, consider creating Roles for those categories of video, too (<strong class="bold">Modify</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Edit Roles</strong> or right-click and go to <strong class="bold">Assign Video Roles</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Edit Roles</strong>), and applying them to the relevant clips. Similarly, if you plan to deliver different audio mixes, you could define additional Roles or Subroles for different languages. You can choose a custom color for each Role, but Subroles share the same color.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-106"><a id="_idTextAnchor109"/>Review — understanding and applying Roles</h2>&#13;
			<p>Let's take just a quick<a id="_idIndexMarker258"/> look back, as this was a short section. Consider how your Project will be exported, and if you need the flexibility to send out different versions (without dialog or titles), then you should set your Roles up now. While most clips will be correctly and automatically tagged as Video, Titles, Dialogue, Music, and Effects, complex productions should set up a few more Roles and Subroles first with &#13;
<strong class="bold">Modify</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">E</strong><strong class="bold">dit Roles</strong>.</p>&#13;
			<p>Later in the process, I'll show you how to mix audio based on Roles and how to show or hide clips based on Roles. Tagging both video and audio correctly now can save a lot of tedious busywork later.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-107"><a id="_idTextAnchor110"/>Summary</h1>&#13;
			<p>Importing your footage can be very simple indeed, and it usually is for me. I create a self-contained Library on my RAID drive, then import media directly into it — but I don't usually collaborate. If I did, I would use external media, then share the media and a "lean" media-free Library with other editors. FCP X will adapt to complex workflows if you need it to.</p>&#13;
			<p>While you can manage media in a more complex way, make sure you're doing it for the right reasons. Too many editors make their jobs unnecessarily difficult, and there's no need for a solo editor to worry about where their video files are stored. They're in the Library!</p>&#13;
			<p>Syncing up Multicams doesn't need to be hard either. While you'll doubtless encounter a tricky job from time to time, if you make sure that every camera records audio, you won't have too much trouble.</p>&#13;
			<p>The next step, however, is crucial. With all of your media imported (and do import some media if you haven't already), your workflow moves to review and organization. Both are deeper and more powerful than they appear at first, and there's plenty to learn. Here we go!</p>&#13;
