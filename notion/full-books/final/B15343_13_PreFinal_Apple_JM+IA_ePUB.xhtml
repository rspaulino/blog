			<p>Now that you've added and animated all of the special additions you want to make to clips, it's time to adjust the way that one clip moves to another and how fast those clips move. Here, you'll learn techniques for working with transitions, including some sneaky tricks and recommended options. Fade, dissolves, pushes, and crazy timeline pins on a bulletin board are all here.</p>&#13;
			<p>After that, you'll learn retiming: how to speed up, slow down, and pause your clips with finesse. While these techniques work best with high-speed footage (and your iPhone does a great job of it), you can apply these tricks to any footage.</p>&#13;
			<p>This chapter covers:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Applying and editing t<span>ransitions</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Retim<span>ing basics</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Speed rampin<span>g and more</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>To begin, let's see how shots can transform into other shots. Though you might not use these all the time, you've got many, many options.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-364"><a id="_idTextAnchor379"/>Applying and editing transitions</h1>&#13;
			<p>Transitions change one <a id="_idIndexMarker1069"/>shot into another, in a simple or complex way. Here, you'll find out which are the best ones to use for various purposes and how to adjust their <a id="_idIndexMarker1070"/>settings, duration, and positioning, as well as why they might not always work.</p>&#13;
			<p>There's an old film school joke where the teacher asks their class what the best transition is. The answer is "a cut." While there's some truth to this, in that a story can be told without fancy transitions or noticeable effects, the world of video encompasses many more types of content than a short or long film for "serious" audiences. If you're creating something for social media, sports, kids, or you have to inject life into a dull corporate piece, then a good transition, well used, is exactly what you want:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer606" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_13.1_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.1: A timeline with plenty of fancy transitions that isn't <span>a disaster</span></p>&#13;
			<p>However, like a slide-based Keynote presentation, you shouldn't go completely crazy. Every novice user of a page layout program uses every font they can, every child learning slide transitions uses all of them, and it's never good. Think of a fancy transition in a video as a fancy slide <a id="_idIndexMarker1071"/>transition in a presentation — it grabs attention, but it shouldn't overstay its welcome, nor should it be repeated over and over. Don't use ten different types of transitions in the one video. </p>&#13;
			<p>Even something as simple as a dissolve can be overdone. If you start adding transitions on every cut, the remaining straight cuts will feel harsh, and every edit will feel too prominent. Transitions should be used sparingly, to help the story along, for a scene break, to indicate the passage of time, or to hide a jump cut edit honestly, in plain sight.</p>&#13;
			<p>There are exceptions, of course: if your job is to present a company's best photos in a video to be shown at their yearly Christmas party, go nuts! Transition between each and every photo, with slightly different versions of the fanciest transition that works.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-365"><a id="_idTextAnchor380"/>Adding transitions</h2>&#13;
			<p>Much like effects, you'll <a id="_idIndexMarker1072"/>start by opening the <strong class="bold">Transitions Browser</strong>, and you'll find its icon right next to the Effects Browser icon:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li>Show the <strong class="bold">Transitions Browser</strong> by pressing <strong class="bold">⌃⌘5</strong> or clicking the icon to the far right in the central<span> gray bar:</span><div id="_idContainer607" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_13.2_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.2: The bowtie, all the way to the right of th<span>e gray bar</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Click <strong class="bold">All</strong> at the top, to see all of the transitions in the pane to <span>the right.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Click any category name to see only the transitions in that<span> category:</span><div id="_idContainer608" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_13.3_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.3: Ah, the Wipes category, perfect for a sci-fi homage and<span> much more</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Hover (skim) over an <a id="_idIndexMarker1073"/>effect to see a preview of this t<span>ransition.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>A transition may have additional options, but you can only preview the defaults, and with two fixed images, a red tree scene transitioning to blue mountains. To see &#13;
a transition with your own media, you'll need to apply it.</p>&#13;
			<p>To apply a video transition to a clip from the <strong class="bold">Transitions Browser</strong>, there are &#13;
a few options:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Select an edit in the timeline, then double-click a transition to apply it to <span>that edit.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Select a clip in the timeline, then double-click a transition to apply to both sides of<span> the clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Select multiple clips or edits in the timeline, then double-click a transition to apply it to all selected clips<span> or edits.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Drag a transition from the <strong class="bold">Transitions Browser</strong> to an edit in the<span> timeline:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer609" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_13.4_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.4: Dragging a transition into place makes sense visually, and previews it<span>s duration</span></p>&#13;
			<p>That last "drag" option shows a preview of the transition in place before you drop it, which is convenient. Dragging also <a id="_idIndexMarker1074"/>allows for <em class="italic">moving</em> a transition from one edit to another and for <em class="italic">replacing</em> a transition, by dragging onto an existing transition.</p>&#13;
			<p>Duplication works too. If you've already added a transition, you can use it again:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Copy one transition, then select another edit <span>and paste.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">⌥-drag</strong> one transition to another edit to dup<span>licate it.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Lastly, if you're keeping it simple, there's another option. Select an edit or clip, then:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Add the default transition, a simple <strong class="bold">Cross Dissolve</strong><span>, with </span><span><strong class="bold">⌘T</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>In everyday edits, I use the <strong class="bold">Cross Dissolve</strong> transition pretty frequently, though I like to keep it short. The duration of this default transition can be defined in <strong class="bold">Final Cut Pro</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Preferences</strong>, under <strong class="bold">Editing</strong>, and I recommend <strong class="bold">0.4</strong> seconds or so:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer610" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_13.5_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.5: Preferences &gt; Editing for transition and fade<span> durations</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Shorter is better for simple transitions; it gets out of the way quickly. More complex transitions need more time, perhaps even a few seconds, but not every edit can support a transition — the source clips must have <a id="_idIndexMarker1075"/>additional extra media beyond the edits, called <strong class="bold">handles</strong>.</p>&#13;
			<p>If you're not sure how much media is available, the <strong class="bold">Precision Editor</strong> mode (double-click on an edit, <strong class="bold">Escape</strong> to leave) will let you see. You'll need extra media on the end of the outgoing clip and at the start of <a id="_idIndexMarker1076"/>the incoming clip, enough to cover the transition on both sides. After all, you can expect to see at least part of both underlying clips as a transition plays, so there has to be something to show:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer611" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_13.6_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.6: The Precision Editor tells the story — there's no more media on the out<span>going clip</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Generally, you'll find out something's wrong when you try to add a transition and an error pops up to tell you that there's not enough media:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer612" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_13.7_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.7: Oh no — not eno<span>ugh media!</span></p>&#13;
			<p>If you approve the alert, one or both clips will be shortened to gather the extra media that the transition needs. If that shortening would ruin the edit, cancel, then tweak the edit to make more room. Usually, a quick roll edit is enough, but you might have to slip.</p>&#13;
			<p>Note that if you drag and drop a transition to an edit where there isn't enough media, it won't display a preview of the <a id="_idIndexMarker1077"/>transition in place, but will still pop up the error and allow the transition to be added.</p>&#13;
			<p>After adding a transition, you'll see it as a new gray box covering the edit, and depending on the zoom level of your timeline, you could see one of three different displays. When zoomed all the way out, you'll see a simple gray box:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer613" class="figure">&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.8: Zoomed all the way out, a gray box with no visibl<span>e controls</span></p>&#13;
			<p>When you zoom in a little more, the gray box has a <strong class="bold">bow tie icon</strong> (this indicates an In and an Out point together, but it really does look like a bow tie):</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer614" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_13.9_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.9: Zoomed in a little, to see t<span>he bow tie</span></p>&#13;
			<p>When you zoom in even <a id="_idIndexMarker1078"/>further, the gray box has the bow tie and a double-line handle on each side of it:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer615" class="figure">&#13;

			<p>To find out more about what your options are, read on.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-366"><a id="_idTextAnchor381"/>Adjusting a transition</h2>&#13;
			<p>The three things <a id="_idIndexMarker1079"/>you can change about every transition are any custom settings it provides, its duration, and its position around the edit. Not all transitions offer customizable settings, but some do, including the <strong class="bold">Dissolve</strong>:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">⌥-click</strong> a <strong class="bold">Cross Dissolve</strong> transition in the timeline to select the transition and move the playhead to t<span>hat point.</span><p>Note that you might need to move the playhead (with <strong class="bold">←</strong> and <strong class="bold">→</strong>) to reach the middle of the transition.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>In the Inspector, experiment with different options in the <strong class="bold">Look</strong> menu, reviewing the results with <strong class="bold">?</strong> (<strong class="bold">⇧/</strong>) after choosing<span> each one.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>These options govern how the <strong class="bold">Cross Dissolve</strong> appears, and it's worth looking at the <strong class="bold">Film</strong>, <strong class="bold">Additive</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Subtractive</strong> options to examine the differences. There's also an <strong class="bold">Ease</strong> control and <strong class="bold">Ease Amount</strong>, though these won't be too noticeable in a quick transition:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer616" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_13.11_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.11: The Cross Dissolve options are more extensive than y<span>ou'd think</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Every transition also <a id="_idIndexMarker1080"/>includes a built-in <strong class="bold">Audio Crossfade</strong>, and in fact, if you expand audio on the clips around the transition, you'll see an indication of the default audio fade. Therefore, there's no need to apply a separate Crossfade to the audio. The menu in the Inspector allows the usual choice of curves to fade with, and further manual control is possible too. If you move the audio edges (even by a frame) the default fade will disappear, and you can define your own audio transition with the audio fade handles instead:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer617" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_13.12_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.12: Audio fades are applied automatically, but can be overridden by dragging the fa<span>de handles</span></p>&#13;
			<p>To change the duration of <a id="_idIndexMarker1081"/>the transition, drag on its left or right edges — the change is symmetrical, affecting both sides at once. You'll see the standard trim cursor when you're in the right place, but there's no filmstrip on the icon because this isn't a ripple operation:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer618" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_13.13_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.13: Duration is easy to change, drag the gray edges — lower down if you've zoomed<span> in though</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Zooming in to reveal the bow tie icon lets you drag on the transition to move its position. A <strong class="bold">Roll icon</strong> will appear to indicate that yes, you're performing a Roll operation, but there's no need to switch to the <strong class="bold">Trim</strong> tool; it happens automatically:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer619" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_13.14_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.14: Drag on the bow tie to roll the edit back a<span>nd forward</span></p>&#13;
			<p>This lets you trade one clip off against another, and you might make a different decision now that you've added a transition.</p>&#13;
			<p>You can drag as far as media allows, though even a very fancy transition is unlikely to play for much more than a second or two. Experimentation will lead to experience here, and if you want consistency, you can always use the keyboard:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Select a transition and press <strong class="bold">⌃D</strong> followed by a timecode and <strong class="bold">return</strong> to set its<span> Duration.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>As before, <strong class="bold">⌃D2.</strong> means two seconds, and <strong class="bold">⌃D15</strong> means 15 frames.</p>&#13;
			<p>Zooming in one more time to show the handles on either side reveals all of the controls at once. With visible <a id="_idIndexMarker1082"/>handles, you can still drag the transition's edges to change duration, but you'll now need to drag on the lower-left or lower-right sides of the transition. The upper handles let you perform ripple edits to one clip at a time:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer620" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_13.15_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.15: Dragging the upper edges with the handles visible lets you adjust In and Out points on t<span>hese clips</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Dragging on the upper-left side performs a ripple edit on the incoming clip on the right while dragging on the upper-right performs a ripple edit on the outgoing clip on the left:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer621" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_13.16_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.16: The Transition Editor (double-click an edit) shows how much media you'll need after adding a <span>transition</span></p>&#13;
			<p>That might seem contradictory, but the two clips do overlap — as the <strong class="bold">Precision Editor</strong> shows. The right handle is <a id="_idIndexMarker1083"/>indicating the true out point of that outgoing clip.</p>&#13;
			<p>Now that you know how to apply and manipulate transitions, what types of transitions are you going to add?</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-367"><a id="_idTextAnchor382"/>The most useful transitions</h2>&#13;
			<p>Cross Dissolve is useful and, as you'll probably use it a lot, leave it as the default with <strong class="bold">⌘T</strong>. There are <a id="_idIndexMarker1084"/>many other transitions here but, as a lot of them come with plenty of character, you might struggle to fit them into most edits. Here are some of the most practical options:</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-368"><a id="_idTextAnchor383"/>Blurs</h3>&#13;
			<p>Softening between clips <a id="_idIndexMarker1085"/>often looks slick, and it's a safe option for many jobs:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Gaussian</strong> is an easy transition to use, with a blur out and then a blur in to the <span>next clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Directional</strong>, <strong class="bold">Zoom</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Zoom &amp; Pan</strong> provide blurs with a little more<span> movement.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-369"><a id="_idTextAnchor384"/>Dissolves </h3>&#13;
			<p>The vital <strong class="bold">Cross Dissolve</strong> lives here, but this <a id="_idIndexMarker1086"/>section has two other important transitions as well:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Fade To Color</strong> is a fade to black by default, and it won't offend anyone. This is probably the second most useful transition after Cross Dissolve, and if you want to fade to some other color, just change the color in the <span>Inspector:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer622" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_13.17_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.17: You can fade to any color with the color chip here, <span>but black </span>&#13;
is m<span>ost useful</span></p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Flow</strong> provides a morph that will sometimes smooth over a jump cut. When you apply this transition, the surrounding clips are analyzed, but if the positions of the subject in the two neighboring frames are close enough, you can disguise the cut completely. What works? A tripod shot of an interview, with similar mouth and head positions on Out and <span>In frames:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer623" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_13.18_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.18: This frame isn't real — the Flow transition created it<span> to cover </span>&#13;
<span>a jump cut</span></p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-370"><a id="_idTextAnchor385"/>Lights</h3>&#13;
			<p>Changing shots with a sudden light <a id="_idIndexMarker1087"/>change is an old trick:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Flash</strong> quickly flicks to white and then back down to the <span>next clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Light Noise</strong> doesn't have any options, but it flashes some gentle white lights up on the edge, to the full screen, and then down. This one works well over a slightly longer duration, and you'll find many third-party <em class="italic">light leak</em> transition<span>s like it:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer624" class="figure">&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.19: A pleasant way to move between shots, but don't<span> overdo it</span></p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Static</strong> is a classic analog "channel changing" effect, but since TVs haven't done this for a while now, it's becoming less rec<span>ognizable.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-371"><a id="_idTextAnchor386"/>Movements</h3>&#13;
			<p>This is a collection of kinetic <a id="_idIndexMarker1088"/>transitions, and while most of these are for special occasions only, there are a few generally useful ones too:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Push</strong> can work in one of the four cardinal directions and is a simple, widely used transition that moves one clip out while the other<span> moves in.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Slide</strong> is similar, but the outgoing clip doesn't move at all, and the incoming clip h<span>as a blur:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer625" class="figure">&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.20: The new clip moves over the old one, with an on-scre<span>en control</span></p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-372"><a id="_idTextAnchor387"/>Objects</h3>&#13;
			<p>Moving things in front of <a id="_idIndexMarker1089"/>shots and using shapes to move between them can add some style, but can be quite attention-grabbing:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Arrows</strong> is pretty slick, and there's flexibility about the ends of t<span>he arrows.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Curtains</strong> is good to start a video of a stage p<span>roduction:</span></li>&#13;

			<p>All of these transitions start from the outgoing clip, zoom out to reveal that you're looking at a single frame of many, pan and move around to show other clips, and then zoom in to one photo as the <a id="_idIndexMarker1092"/>transition ends and the clip restarts:</p>&#13;

			<p>Each clip that's visible here is actually a still frame from the Primary Storyline on the current Project, and while the transition is selected, you can drag the numbered <strong class="bold">Timeline Pins</strong> around to position them anywhere you want in the Project.

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-376"><a id="_idTextAnchor391"/>Recap — Applying and editing transitions</h2>&#13;
			<p>Transitions are not <a id="_idIndexMarker1095"/>the devil; sometimes, they bring just the right amount of life to a dull edit or spice to a lively edit. When you add an appropriate transition, get the settings and duration right, and tweak the position a little, you can get great results. You'll still be <strong class="bold">⌥-clicking</strong> to see what you're doing, changing values in the Inspector, and reviewing until you're happy.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-377"><a id="_idTextAnchor392"/>Retiming basics </h1>&#13;
			<p>In this section, you'll learn how to play clips faster or slower than normal, for special effects, for slow motion, or <a id="_idIndexMarker1096"/>even to deal with footage at the wrong frame rate. After a quick look at the different kinds of footage you might need to deal with, you'll discover how to apply an overall speed change to a clip.</p>&#13;
			<p>All of the important retiming commands are in the same menu — the third icon (a speedometer) at the lower left of the Viewer. To get started, you'll need a few clips in a timeline and ideally some high-speed clips for slow-motion. If you have an iPhone, switch it into <strong class="bold">Slo-Mo</strong> mode now and record something moving. For great results, blow a raspberry to the camera, create a water splash somehow, or dance.</p>&#13;
			<p>If you have used your iPhone, don't Airdrop it to your Mac because that will lock in a pre-defined slow-motion effect. Plug the iPhone into your Mac and import it to FCP X directly to get the full original clip.</p>&#13;
			<p>From other cameras, just import as usual. If some of your clips are high-speed clips, that's great, but they don't need to be. Let's move onward:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">⌥-click</strong> on a clip to select it and move the playhead to t<span>hat point.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>From the <strong class="bold">Retiming</strong> menu, choose <strong class="bold">Slow</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">50%</strong>, and play the foo<span>tage back.</span><div id="_idContainer630" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_13.25_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.25: The Retime menu, at the lower-left of the Viewer (pay no attention to the silline<span>ss behind)</span></p><p>This clip will now run for twice as long, using the same part of the clip that it did before. You'll also see a new colored bar above this clip, the Retime Editor, showing the new speed of this clip, and a drop-down menu that offers the most important options from the main Retime menu:</p><div id="_idContainer631" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_13.26_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.26: The Retime Editor is a simple and effective way to govern speed; Orange <span>means slow</span></p><p>The <strong class="bold">Retime Editor</strong> can be shown or hidden with <strong class="bold">⌘R</strong>, and will currently be Orange to indicate that the footage has been slowed down. Orange indicates a slow down, while Green indicates normal speed, and <a id="_idIndexMarker1097"/>Blue indicates a speed up.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Drag the single-line handle to the left until the line becomes Blue, and play the foo<span>tage back:</span><div id="_idContainer632" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_13.27_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.27: Blue means fast, the same video over<span> less time</span></p><p>The handle controls the speed at which the clip plays back. Dragging it to the left means the clip speeds up, taking less time to play. While it's possible to drag the handle to whatever speed you wish, you can achieve slightly smoother slow-down results with the menu's options: 10/25/50%. Another alternative is to use <strong class="bold">Custom</strong> speed.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">Custom</strong> from the <strong class="bold">Retime</strong> menu, the <strong class="bold">Retime Editor</strong> menu on the clip, or by pre<span>ssing </span><span><strong class="bold">⌃⌥R</strong></span><span>:</span><div id="_idContainer633" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_13.28_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.28: Custom speed has a few n<span>eat tricks</span></p><p>The Custom dialog offers some unique features, allowing you to express the clip's speed by defining a new speed as a percentage or a duration and to reverse the clip.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Set <strong class="bold">Rate</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">20%</strong> in the dialog and press <strong class="bold">return</strong><span> to apply.</span><p>Don't overlook an important checkbox here: <strong class="bold">Ripple</strong>. If you change a primary timeline clip's speed by dragging the <a id="_idIndexMarker1098"/>handle or using a pre-defined speed option, it will change the clip length and cause a ripple down the timeline. If this isn't what you want, you could Lift that clip up to be a connected clip, but sometimes that's not an option either:</p><div id="_idContainer634" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_13.29_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.29: Uncheck Ripple, then change a primary storyline clip's speed to avoid leng<span>th changes</span></p><p>With the Ripple option disabled, the timeline clip length remains constant, no matter whether it's connected or in a Storyline. The speed change, therefore, controls how much of the clip you see — if you set the speed to 200%, you'll see twice as much of the clip as you did before, playing twice as fast. When this happens, the In point is locked, but the Out point (of the source clip) will change. It's a little like a Slip, but by changing the speed of the source clip, and indeed, you can switch to the <strong class="bold">Trim</strong> tool (<strong class="bold">T</strong>) and Slip the resulting video if <a id="_idIndexMarker1099"/>you're not seeing the best part of the clip.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">Retime</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Reverse Clip</strong> to play the clip<span> backward.</span><p>Reverse is indicated in the <strong class="bold">Retime Editor</strong> with arrows pointing to the left, and with a negative speed percentage:</p></li>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.30: Reverse is shown by arrows on top of whatever speed change is alrea<span>dy applied</span></p>&#13;
			<p>It's most useful with a tracking shot over a mostly static subject, such as a drone shot over a mountain, but it's more fun with footage of people eating.</p>&#13;
			<p>There's one more way to change a clip's speed, and it involves no dialogs. If you mark the In and Out point of a source clip, then drag it onto a timeline clip that you'd like to replace, you can choose <strong class="bold">Replace with Retime to Fit</strong> from the pop-up menu that appears:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer636" class="figure">&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.31: Drag one clip onto another, wait for it to go white, then Replace with Retime to Fit fro<span>m the menu</span></p>&#13;
			<p>A speed change will then be automatically added to fit the chosen clip in the duration available.</p>&#13;
			<p>So far, so good — these are the basics of changing the speed of a whole clip to be faster, slower, or backward. Before <a id="_idIndexMarker1100"/>looking at speed ramping, let's take a quick look at how to get the smoothest possible output.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-378"><a id="_idTextAnchor393"/>Understanding slow motion and Automatic Speed</h2>&#13;
			<p>To get the <a id="_idIndexMarker1101"/>best results from slow motion, you'll need to know exactly what's happening, and that's what this section is about. You'll find out how slowing down footage <a id="_idIndexMarker1102"/>works and how to use <strong class="bold">Automa</strong><strong class="bold">tic Speed</strong>.</p>&#13;
			<p>When you speed up footage, as in a time-lapse video, frames will be skipped. The speed-up factor can get very, very large; if you record an hour of continuous footage and want to present it as a timelapse over a few seconds, you might use a speed of <strong class="bold">20,000</strong><strong class="bold">%</strong> or more:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer637" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_13.32_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.32: If your camera can't record time-lapse, record regular video for a long time, then s<span>peed it up</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Big speed changes are generally fine, but a small difference, such as 30fps footage playing at 25fps, will be more noticeable and is likely to stutter. Remember — <em class="italic">if you're not shooting for slow motion, record at the frame rate you want t</em><em class="italic">o deliver</em>.</p>&#13;
			<p>To slow down footage, you'll get the best results if you've recorded at a higher frame rate because no new frames will need to be invented. With regular speed footage (say, 24fps footage in a 24fps Project), one of three modes will be used after a speed reduction:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Normal</strong> — Frames are repeated, usually with a visible<span> stutter. </span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Frame Blending</strong> — Nearby frames are blended together, often overly smooth and unc<span>onvincing:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer638" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_13.33_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.33: Overlapped frames don't look great in a still frame, nor<span> in motion</span></p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Optical Flow</strong> — New frames are created by morphing nearby frames, which takes time to process, and can be good with some kinds of movement but bad wi<span>th others:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer639" class="figure">&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.34: The same frame with Optical Flow is much better on the central bird, but it can fail i<span>n odd ways</span></p>&#13;
			<p>These options can be chosen from <strong class="bold">Retime</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Video Quality</strong>. But with planning and the right camera, and if the source footage was recorded at a higher speed, real frames can be used instead, and nothing needs to be invented. Surprisingly, your phone is likely to do a better job of this than most professional cameras, and it will present its footage a little differently.</p>&#13;
			<p>High-speed iPhone footage plays back in "real time" by default, skipping a lot of frames — for example, shooting 240fps and then playing back just one in ten of those frames at 24fps:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer640" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_13.35_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.35: Modern iPhones are great for capturing slow motion underwater — look for the high <span>speed icon</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Slowing the footage down displays more of those frames, and it's going to look pretty good. But for the <a id="_idIndexMarker1103"/>smoothest, slowest natural results, use <strong class="bold">Retime</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Automatic Speed</strong>, to play every frame that was recorded at the speed of the timeline:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer641" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_13.36_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.36: Show every frame with Autom<span>atic Speed</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Automatic Speed is especially helpful with B-roll clips that are slightly off the correct frame rate. If your timeline is at 24fps or 25fps, but you've been given footage at 30fps, just apply Automatic Speed and they'll play just slightly slower than normal, using every frame available and giving a slightly slower, quite appealing look. Note that this will affect audio speed too, though the on-by-default <strong class="bold">Retime</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Preserve Pitch</strong> option will prevent chipmunk noises.</p>&#13;
			<p>However, you won't always need to choose Automatic Speed because many cameras perform a slow-motion conversion for you, at least with the highest frame rates. For example, a GH5 set to record 180fps will <a id="_idIndexMarker1104"/>actually perform an "automatic speed conform" by recording all of those frames to a file with a "regular" frame rate, anything from 24fps to 60fps:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer642" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_13.37_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.37: The Panasonic GH5, in "VFR" mode, converts a higher frame rate into a lower one<span> in-camera</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The file will claim to be that <a id="_idIndexMarker1105"/>slower frame rate and will play for a much longer time than you recorded. Therefore, it's been pre-conformed and you don't need to slow it down (though you might choose to speed it up).</p>&#13;
			<p>Outside of special high frame rate modes, most cameras will accurately tag a clip's frame rate up to 60fps, and you'll need to choose Automatic Speed to slow down these clips yourself. You'll be able to find out what your camera does without too much trouble, but in general, frame rates up to 50fps or 60fps are treated as normal while frame rates higher than that are likely to be slowed down in camera. </p>&#13;
			<p>A good strategy for footage that you <em class="italic">might</em> want to slow down is to record at double your normal frame rate: 50fps rather than the usual 25fps or 60fps instead of 30fps. That gives you the option to easily slow any part of it down to 50% though you may have to compromise on shutter speed.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">IMPORTANT NOTE</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">To satisfy the 180° shutter angle rule, a shutter speed of 1/(double the frame rate) gives the appropriate amount of blur. Shooting at 1/50 for 25fps, 1/60 for 30fps, 1/100 for 50fps, and 1/120 for 60fps would be ideal. So, if you shoot at 50fps but then use the footage at 25fps, the footage will appear slightly choppier than usual, with less motion blur. You can see this in real-world productions too — if it's a little choppy, expect a speed ramp at any moment. But don't worry too much about this rule at higher speeds; there's little blur to be had.</p>&#13;
			<p>The bottom line: for the best quality slow motion, record more frames than your timeline requires. </p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-379"><a id="_idTextAnchor394"/>Review — retiming</h2>&#13;
			<p>Just a few years ago, high-speed recording was only possible at the high end of town. And while many <a id="_idIndexMarker1106"/>cameras still struggle to record at high speeds, phones have come to the rescue. In many cases, you'll trade some image quality to achieve those higher speeds, but even 50fps or 60fps footage can be used effectively to create beautiful B-roll. With only regular-speed footage, Optical Flow can help, but there's no substitute for real frames. Start out with high-speed footage and simply set it to Automatic Speed if you want to use every frame you've shot.</p>&#13;
			<p>But what if you don't? If you've got enough frames, you can go "full manual" to create a fast-slow-fast attention-grabbing piece. And that's up next.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-380"><a id="_idTextAnchor395"/>Speed ramping and more</h1>&#13;
			<p>In this section, you'll find out all <a id="_idIndexMarker1107"/>about speed ramping, in which a clip's speed changes over time. You'll also find out about freeze and hold frames, when to use a few trick-shot techniques, and the extra settings that can make all the difference for a tricky speed change.</p>&#13;
			<p>So far, we've adjusted the speed for an entire clip, but a speed ramp involves a change in speed: slow to fast or fast to slow. There are two main ways to create a speed ramp:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Select a region of a clip (with the <strong class="bold">Range Selection</strong> tool or <strong class="bold">I</strong> and <strong class="bold">O</strong>) and then choose a new speed for that region from the Re<span>time menu:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer643" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_13.38_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.38: With a region in this 10% speed clip selected, I can return that secti<span>on to 100%</span></p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Hover above a selected clip then break it up into speed regions with <strong class="bold">Retime</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Blade Speed</strong> (<strong class="bold">⇧B</strong>, not the <a id="_idIndexMarker1108"/>regular <strong class="bold">Blade</strong> tool). Choose a new speed for each region from the <strong class="bold">Retime</strong> menu or the <strong class="bold">Retime Editor</strong> po<span>p-up menu:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer644" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_13.39_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.39: Create new speed regions, then change the spe<span>ed in each</span></p>&#13;
			<p>With both these techniques, the clip will be split into two or more speed regions. Each region has its own speed, and the speed ramp is created by an automatic transition, a gray box that bridges the two regions in the <strong class="bold">Reti</strong><strong class="bold">me Editor</strong>.</p>&#13;
			<p>Each region's speed can be adjusted by using the pop-up menu in the <strong class="bold">Retime Editor</strong> or by the single-line handle on the right-hand side.</p>&#13;
			<p>The transition duration, and therefore the length of the speed ramp, can be adjusted by dragging on either side of the gray transition zone:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer645" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_13.40_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.40: Drag the gray transition edges to govern how long <span>the speed </span>&#13;
ch<span>ange takes</span></p>&#13;
			<p>To use this effectively, you'll ideally want a fresh clip where something exciting happens in slow motion. The clip should start out at normal speed, playing right up until just before the key moment — a bike flying off a ramp, an indie musician jumping, or a drink being spilled on someone — the moment of amusing disaster. Find that moment, and then:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>If you prefer to use the <strong class="bold">Range Selection</strong> method, select from the key moment forwards, then choose <strong class="bold">Retime</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Slow</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">10%</strong> to ge<span>t started.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>If you prefer <strong class="bold">Blade Speed</strong>, hover just before the key moment, press <strong class="bold">⇧B</strong>, and then use the Retime Editor pop-up <a id="_idIndexMarker1109"/>menu on the second part to choose <strong class="bold">S</strong><span><strong class="bold">low</strong></span><span> &gt; </span><span><strong class="bold">10%.</strong></span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Either way, you'll then want to finesse the length of the speed transition to make it longer or shorter. In general, a shorter transition period works best. Next, to enjoy the aftermath at normal speed, do one of these:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>If you prefer to use the <strong class="bold">Range Selection</strong> method, select from where the key moment has ended, then choose <strong class="bold">Retime</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">No</strong><span><strong class="bold">rmal 100%</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>If you prefer <strong class="bold">Blade Speed</strong>, hover just after the key moment ends, press <strong class="bold">⇧B</strong>, and then use the <strong class="bold">Retime Editor</strong> pop-up menu on the second part to choose <strong class="bold">No</strong><span><strong class="bold">rmal 100%</strong></span><span>:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer646" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_13.41_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.41: When you're done, this is what your clip should<span> look like</span></p>&#13;
			<p>You'll see three speed regions set to <strong class="bold">100%</strong>, <strong class="bold">10%</strong>, and <strong class="bold">100%</strong> and you can finesse the duration of that second speed transition as needed.</p>&#13;
			<p>If something's not quite right, it's possible to use the Range Selection tool again, selecting parts of existing speed regions, and then choosing a new speed, even 100%. However, if you have placed the speed regions at the wrong points in the clip, a little too early or late, it's not obvious how to fix it. Dragging the single-line handle at the end of the Retime Editor changes speed <a id="_idIndexMarker1110"/>but not the part of the clip that's been selected. To effectively roll the transition point between two speed regions, follow these steps:</p>&#13;

				<li>Double-click the frame control to return to the reti<span>me handle.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>This is extremely well hidden but very useful. Picking the right point to begin a speed ramp is as important as getting an edit in just the right place, and you'll master it with time. </p>&#13;
			<p>As well as the <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> button, the <a id="_idIndexMarker1111"/>small popup you saw in that process also allows you to remove a speed transition completely. Speed transitions can also be removed in the main Retime menu.</p>&#13;
			<p>If you've made a big mess and want to start from scratch, do the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">Retime</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Reset Speed</strong> (<strong class="bold">⌥⌘</strong><strong class="bold">R</strong>) to remove all speed changes from<span> the clip.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>It's often easier to <strong class="bold">Reset Speed</strong> than to fight with several regions.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-381"><a id="_idTextAnchor396"/>Using special speed modes</h2>&#13;
			<p>While I normally <a id="_idIndexMarker1112"/>prefer to create speed ramps by hand, there are some "trick shot" modes that perform complex tasks. They're available in the <strong class="bold">Retime</strong> menu and are:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Speed Ramp</strong>, <strong class="bold">to 0%</strong> or <strong class="bold">from 0%</strong> — This creates several blended regions that slow down a clip to a standstill or speed up from a standstill. I find I rarely want to come to a complete stop, so I don't use t<span>his often.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Instant Replay</strong> (various speeds) — Play the clip at normal speed, then play it again at normal speed or slowed down, with an "Instant Replay" title. The title can, of course, be replaced or deleted, but usually, I'd prefer to duplicate the clip with an <strong class="bold">⌥-drag</strong>, then slow down the se<span>cond clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Rewind</strong> (various speeds) — Play the clip at normal speed, then play backward at normal speed or faster (4x) is good, then play the clip again. This c<span>an be fun:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.44: The Rewind mode is good when you just want to see somet<span>hing again</span></p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Jump Cut at Markers</strong> — When you <a id="_idIndexMarker1113"/>apply this to a clip with markers, it skips a chosen number of frames at each marker point with speed changes while keeping the clip continuous. It's for special <span>occasions.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-382"><a id="_idTextAnchor397"/>Hold Frames and Freeze Frames</h2>&#13;
			<p>In educational and other videos, it's common to pause a clip midway, to be able to draw attention to some <a id="_idIndexMarker1114"/>aspect of it, before playing the rest of the clip. There are two ways to pause a clip, and the method you choose will depend on how you prefer to manage your timeline. If you want to keep a clip whole and use speed changes, do the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Hover where you want to add a pause, then press <strong class="bold">⇧H</strong> to add a <strong class="bold">H</strong><span><strong class="bold">old Frame</strong></span><span>:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer650" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_13.45_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.45: This clip pauses with the Hold Frame integrated int<span>o the clip</span></p>&#13;
			<p>A <strong class="bold">Hold Frame</strong> is a speed region with 0% speed, shown in Red. The duration of a Hold Frame can be changed by <a id="_idIndexMarker1115"/>dragging the standard single-line handle in the Retime Editor.</p>&#13;
			<p>If you would prefer that the still frame become an entirely separate clip, do the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Hover where you want to add a pause, then press <strong class="bold">⌥F</strong> to add a <strong class="bold">Fre</strong><span><strong class="bold">eze Frame</strong></span><span>:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer651" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_13.46_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.46: This clip also pauses but via a separate Freeze <span>Frame clip</span></p>&#13;
			<p>A <strong class="bold">Freeze Frame</strong> functions much the same as a <strong class="bold">Hold Frame</strong>, but it creates three separate clips. These are the <a id="_idIndexMarker1116"/>first and second parts of the video, and a <a id="_idTextAnchor398"/>new still image in between, which can simply be trimmed to change its duration. A downside is that any effects or color corrections will now need to be managed independently. However, this can be a good strategy on longer clips, if managing multiple speed ramps on a single clip is becoming unwieldy.</p>&#13;
			<p>Either of these techniques can be used with titles, for example, to pause between subsequent bullets, but you'll have to turn the title into a Compound Clip first. There'll be more on that in <a href="B15343_15_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor446"><em class="italic">Chapter 15</em></a>, <em class="italic">A Few Words: Titles and G</em><em class="italic">enerators</em>.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-383"><a id="_idTextAnchor399"/>Recap — Retiming and speed ramping</h2>&#13;
			<p>Speed changes <a id="_idIndexMarker1117"/>are a great excuse to dust off that old action <a id="_idIndexMarker1118"/>camera and get moving or at least to blow a raspberry to a slow motion camera. It's always hilarious. Start simple, then build up complexity when the situation demands it. Timing is everything.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-384"><a id="_idTextAnchor400"/>Summary</h1>&#13;
			<p>If you're not editing a feature film or serious short, straight cuts are not always enough. Transitions can help you to smooth the relationship between two shots, sure, but they can also grab attention on their own. Maybe the shots around a transition need breathing room, a creative connection, or a way to keep them separate or you're disguising a cut you had to have. Or maybe the content is boring, and you need to inject some life to keep the audience awake. Even my least favorite transition, Page Peel, can justify itself in the right context.</p>&#13;
			<p>Retiming brings a whole new dimension to clips that a video effect can't — playing with time. Newer cameras have given us the power to record footage at higher frame rates than ever before, and with or without all of those extra frames, you now have a way to bring attention to specific moments.</p>&#13;
			<p>Transitions and retiming can be used for great things, but they can also contribute to wildly over-the-top edits. So, yes, you could shoot everything in slow motion and use every transition possible, but most edits can't justify that. They really are fun, but… <em class="italic">just because you can doesn't mean y</em><em class="italic">ou should.</em></p>&#13;
