			<p class="author-quote">"With FCP X, I was able to establish my own filmmaking and editing business in remote outback Queensland, to create and share the unique stories of the people of <span>the bush."</span></p>&#13;
			<p class="author-quote-source">— Kirstie Davison, MaRiKi Media</p>&#13;
			<p class="author-quote-source">Kirstie is a videographer and editor based in Blackall, Queensland, Australia. (<a href="http://www.marikimedia.com">www.marikimedia.com</a>)</p>&#13;
			<p>Following the book so far, you've been moving clips around in time, chopping them up, selecting and deleting, and hopefully getting a bit more confident. Probably the single most common operation you've done so far is a basic trim on a single edit point. Simple one-point trimming is certainly a useful operation, and you can make a clip longer or shorter with the keyboard or the mouse. But a one-point trim doesn't always do enough.</p>&#13;
			<p>In this chapter, you'll discover several ways to adjust not one, but two edit points at the same time. This chapter covers the following topics:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Rolli<span>ng an edit</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Slipping and Sli<span>ding clips</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Softening audio with split edits (J- a<span>nd L-cuts)</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Editing numerically and with the Precis<span>ion Editor</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>By the end of this chapter, you'll understand when and how to use the <strong class="bold">Trim</strong> tool and you'll be able to make subtle edits that don't cause a ripple effect all along the timeline. You'll be able to use a different part of a source clip with a single flick, and move the edit point between two clips. You'll also learn how to soften your edits by cutting audio and video separately, how to edit with numbers, and how to use the Precision Editor, a special mode that exposes the media behind each edit.</p>&#13;
			<p>Before we begin, a quick word on the best ways to switch between tools. Most of these edits are enabled by the <strong class="bold">Trim</strong> tool (<strong class="bold">T</strong>) that's found in the regular tool menu, and you'll be toggling between it and the regular <strong class="bold">Select</strong> tool (<strong class="bold">A</strong>) from here on. Use the keys!</p>&#13;
			<p>The tool menu can be seen in the following screenshot:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer278" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_8.1_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 8.1: The tool menu is found on the central gray bar"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.1: The tool menu is found on the centra<span>l gray bar</span></p>&#13;
			<p>As with all the tool shortcuts, you can use keys as a persistent switch, or a temporary one, as follows:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>To switch to the <strong class="bold">Trim</strong> tool persistently (that is, until you switch to another tool), just press the <strong class="bold">T</strong> key and <span>let it go.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>To switch to the <strong class="bold">Trim</strong> tool temporarily, hold down the <strong class="bold">T</strong> key, perform your trimming operations, and then release <span>the </span><span><strong class="bold">T</strong></span><span> key.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>If you're using the "temporary" strategy, your previously selected tool will be selected once you release the key. This technique works with all of the tool shortcuts. For now, we'll start out with the regular <strong class="bold">Select</strong> tool, so press <strong class="bold">A</strong> to switch to that for a quick discussion about trimming, before we jump to Rolling. To work along with the book, use regular clips rather than Multicam Clips for now, because (as you'll see in the next chapter) trimming functions differently with multicams.</p>&#13;
			<p>Shortcuts sorted — great. Onward!</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-220"><a id="_idTextAnchor228"/>Rolling an edit</h1>&#13;
			<p>While a regular trim adjusts <a id="_idIndexMarker499"/>an In point or an Out point on a clip, a Roll edit adjusts the Out point on one clip and the In point on the next clip at the same time, by the same duration. While it works best on two neighboring clips in the Primary Storyline, it can also work on two clips in a connected storyline, or even on two independently connected clips that have no gap between them. </p>&#13;
			<p>Why would you want to do that? Because it lets you trade one clip's length against another <em class="italic">without causing a ripple down the timeline</em>. The first clip gets longer while the second clip gets<a id="_idIndexMarker500"/> shorter, and no other clips move at all. This is a key point, so let's quickly recap on how a regular trim works.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-221"><a id="_idTextAnchor229"/>Understanding a regular trim edit</h2>&#13;
			<p>To see the ripple<a id="_idIndexMarker501"/> edits that regular trims cause, here's a timeline before a regular<a id="_idIndexMarker502"/> one-point trim operation (using the <strong class="bold">Select</strong> tool) with a single Out point selected:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer279" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_8.2_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 8.2: The Select tool dragging an Out point"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.2: The Select tool dragging an<span> Out point</span></p>&#13;
			<p>And now, as that Out point is dragged, later clips are being rippled down the timeline, as you can see:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer280" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_8.3_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 8.3: As the Out point moves right, other clips are pushed away"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.3: As the Out point moves right, other clips are p<span>ushed away</span></p>&#13;
			<p>If the In point had been selected instead, the previous clip would have moved forward to fill the gap, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer281" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_8.4_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 8.4: Dragging the In point to the right makes the clip shorter, but no gap is made"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.4: Dragging the In point to the right makes the clip shorter, but no g<span>ap is made</span></p>&#13;
			<p>You've performed both of these operations a few times already, but if you're not confident, feel free to practice. You'll be able to see the two-up display in the <strong class="bold">Viewer</strong> change as you do this, but <a id="_idIndexMarker503"/>only one side of the display will change; after all, you're<a id="_idIndexMarker504"/> only adjusting one edit point. When you're clear, read on.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-222"><a id="_idTextAnchor230"/>Performing a Roll edit</h2>&#13;
			<p>Because one point <a id="_idIndexMarker505"/>isn't always enough, let's now try using a Roll edit to adjust two points, as follows:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Press <strong class="bold">T</strong> to switch to the <span><strong class="bold">Trim</strong></span><span> tool.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Hover over the point between two clips, and you'll see the cursor s<span>hown here:</span><div id="_idContainer282" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_8.5_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 8.5: Neighboring Out and In points are selected together"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.5: Neighboring Out and In points are selecte<span>d together</span></p><p>Unlike the regular trimming cursor, which has one in or out indicator and one filmstrip, the Roll cursor shows both an Out point and neighboring In point, plus two filmstrips, indicating that two edit points will be adjusted.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Click and drag left or right to perform a Roll edit, as illustrated in the following s<span>creenshot:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer283" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_8.6_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 8.6: Both points move to the left, and overall timeline duration is constant"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.6: Both points move to the left, and overall timeline duration i<span>s constant</span></p>&#13;
			<p>This time, you'll see both frames in the two-up display in the <strong class="bold">Viewer</strong> changing. You'll also notice that the overall length of the timeline stays the same and that no other clips are affected in any way. The Roll operation is therefore extremely helpful when you're getting closer to the end of an edit and you don't want to move things around anymore.</p>&#13;
			<p>As you might expect, you can only Roll a clip as far as the media allows. If you drag all the way to the start or <a id="_idIndexMarker506"/>end of a clip, you'll see a red clip edge that stops you moving any further, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer284" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_8.7_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 8.7: Red edge? You're out of media"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.7: Red edge? You're ou<span>t of media</span></p>&#13;
			<p>While you probably won't have any trouble triggering the Roll operation, the <strong class="bold">Trim</strong> tool still actually allows you to perform a regular one-point trim operation — you just have to be more specific about where you place the mouse. As you move toward the center of where two edits meet, the cursor switches to indicate a two-point Roll, but if you move a little further toward either side, the cursor will change back to indicate a regular one-point trim. As ever, if you get it wrong, a quick <strong class="bold">⌘Z</strong> will fix things up. In general, I find that if I want a regular one-point trim, I'll just press <strong class="bold">A</strong> to switch to the <strong class="bold">Select</strong> tool rather than<a id="_idIndexMarker507"/> fiddling with the <strong class="bold">Trim</strong> tool to find the right spot.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-223"><a id="_idTextAnchor231"/>Using keyboard shortcuts to Roll</h2>&#13;
			<p>Unsurprisingly, you <a id="_idIndexMarker508"/>can Roll with the keyboard as well as with the mouse, and the process is as you'd expect. Here's a hybrid method using both together:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Press <strong class="bold">T</strong> to select the <strong class="bold">Trim</strong> tool, and hover between two clips (above the neighboring out and i<span>n points).</span></li>&#13;
				<li>With the <strong class="bold">Roll</strong> cursor showing, click the edit to select both point<span>s at once.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">comma</strong> to move both points one frame to the left, or <strong class="bold">period</strong> to move both points one frame to <span>the right.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">⇧comma</strong> to move both points 10 frames to the left, or <strong class="bold">⇧period</strong> to move both points 10 frames to <span>the right.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>These shortcuts are fantastic for making minor tweaks to an edit, and a couple of frames can make all the difference in a scene. Remember to check your work by using <strong class="bold">Play Around Edit</strong> (<strong class="bold">⇧/</strong> or <strong class="bold">?</strong>) after you adjust. (For the moment, we'll adjust video and audio together, but we'll split them up soon.)</p>&#13;
			<p>For the truly mouse-averse, there's no need to select with the mouse at all. You'll remember the following shortcuts from <a href="B15343_06_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor164"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Build the Spine of the Story: Quick</em><em class="italic"> Assembly</em>:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">↓</strong> or <strong class="bold">apostrophe (')</strong> jumps to the first frame of the<span> next clip</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">↑</strong> or <strong class="bold">semicolon (;)</strong> jumps to the first frame of the pre<span>vious clip</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">[</strong> selects the Out point of the clip to the left of th<span>e playhead</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">]</strong> selects the In point of the clip to the right of th<span>e playhead</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>To select two points for a Roll edit, you'll need one more key, as follows:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">\</strong> selects both Out and In points around th<span>e playhead</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>The <strong class="bold">\</strong> key is to the right of <strong class="bold">[</strong> and <strong class="bold">]</strong> on Australian and North American keyboards, and just below and to the right on UK keyboards, so it's physically nearby. It's entirely up to you if you prefer a hybrid mouse/keyboard approach or the keyboard-only way instead, but if you would prefer to hover<a id="_idIndexMarker509"/> with the mouse and then switch to the keyboard, be sure to activate <strong class="bold">Sna</strong><strong class="bold">pping</strong> (<strong class="bold">N</strong>).</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-224"><a id="_idTextAnchor232"/>Review — Rolling an edit</h2>&#13;
			<p>Trading one clip against <a id="_idIndexMarker510"/>another is a vital step toward more subtle edits. If you're happy with the overall length of a sequence, but one clip is a little long and the next is a little short, you need to know how to Roll. But that's not the only trick that the <strong class="bold">Trim</strong> tool can do: it can also Slip and Slide.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-225"><a id="_idTextAnchor233"/>Slipping and Sliding clips</h1>&#13;
			<p>These two<a id="_idIndexMarker511"/> operations<a id="_idIndexMarker512"/> both adjust two edit points, but they don't move the outgoing Out point on Clip A and the incoming In point on Clip B. Instead, a <strong class="bold">Slip</strong> adjusts both the In and Out points on a single clip, like this:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer285" class="figure">&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.8: Using the Trim tool on the body of a clip (not the edges) crea<span>tes a Slip</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The less common <strong class="bold">Slide</strong> operation adjusts the Out point before a clip and the In point after a clip, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer286" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_8.9_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 8.9: Using the Trim tool on the body of a clip while holding ⌥ creates a Slide"/>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.9: Using the Trim tool on the body of a clip while holding ⌥ creat<span>es a Slide</span></p>&#13;
			<p>That probably won't make a lot of sense without some good examples, so let's dig into those in<a id="_idIndexMarker513"/> more<a id="_idIndexMarker514"/> detail.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-226"><a id="_idTextAnchor234"/>Using a Slip edit</h2>&#13;
			<p>This is easier to do<a id="_idIndexMarker515"/> than to explain, so add a clip with obvious movement to help you to<a id="_idIndexMarker516"/> follow along. Here, I've added part of a clip to the timeline: a shot of a boat moving from left to right. The shot starts with the boat fully in frame, but ends completely out of shot to the right, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer287" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_8.10_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 8.10: The sequential thumbnails tell the story of a boat moving left to right"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.10: The sequential thumbnails tell the story of a boat moving lef<span>t to right</span></p>&#13;
			<p>If you're working with your own media, make sure you're only using part of a clip, and preferably a part of the clip somewhere in the middle. A handy tool here is to select a timeline clip, then press <strong class="bold">⇧F</strong> to <strong class="bold">Reveal in Browser</strong>, which shows the original Browser clip. (This is a <em class="italic">match frame</em> operation, if you're an old hand.) In the Browser, you can see the whole source clip selected, and if you've enabled<strong class="bold"> View</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Browser</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Used Media Ranges</strong>, you can also see an orange line underneath the section of the clip currently in use, like this:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer288" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_8.11_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 8.11: As seen in the Browser, with the orange line indicating Used media"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.11: As seen in the Browser, with the orange line indicating <span>Used media</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Understanding the link between a clip in the timeline and the source clip in the Browser will be useful in these next steps:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>With the <strong class="bold">Trim</strong> tool (<strong class="bold">T</strong>) selected, click on the middle of a clip (not near the left or right edges) and drag sideways to perform a Slip edit, as illustrated in the following s<span>creenshot:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer289" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_8.12_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 8.12: The two highlighted edit points are being adjusted"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.12: The two highlighted edit points are bein<span>g adjusted</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The moving filmstrips make this a natural operation. If you drag to the left, you'll use a later part of the clip, and if you drag to the right, you'll use an earlier part of the clip. You can tell what's happening by watching the filmstrip thumbnails, and the Viewer will show you the clip's new In point and Out point as you drag.</p>&#13;
			<p>Here, I've dragged to <a id="_idIndexMarker517"/>the left, to use the later part of the clip. As the boat is moving from left <a id="_idIndexMarker518"/>to right, the shot starts with the boat about to leave the frame, and finishes at some point after the boat has left the frame. While I hold the mouse button, the Viewer looks like this:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer290" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_8.13_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 8.13: The Viewer's two-up display shows the changing In and Out points on the clip"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.13: The Viewer's two-up display shows the changing In and Out points o<span>n the clip</span></p>&#13;
			<p>After releasing the mouse, in the Browser, you can see the orange line is now later in the clip, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer291" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_8.14_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 8.14: The orange line indicates which part of the media is used"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.14: The orange line indicates which part of the med<span>ia is used</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Conversely, if I were to drag on the clip to the right with the <strong class="bold">Trim</strong> tool, I'd Slip the clip earlier and eventually run out of media, as you can see:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer292" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_8.15_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 8.15: The filmstrip on the two-up display indicates the end of the media"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.15: The filmstrip on the two-up display indicates the end of<span> the media</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The filmstrip on the left <a id="_idIndexMarker519"/>edge indicates that I'm at the very start of the clip and <a id="_idIndexMarker520"/>have run out of media. I can also see that from the red clip edge in the timeline, as illustrated:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer293" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_8.16_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 8.16: When you Slip all the way to the start of the clip, you'll see a red left edge"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.16: When you Slip all the way to the start of the clip, you'll see a red<span> left edge</span></p>&#13;
			<p>And after releasing the mouse, the Browser tells the same story:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer294" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_8.17_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 8.17: With the clip slipped this far back, the boat never leaves the frame"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.17: With the clip slipped this far back, the boat never leaves<span> the frame</span></p>&#13;
			<p>There's a handy analogy here. Think of a clip on the timeline as a window that lets you see part of its whole source clip. The Slip operation lets you grab the whole source clip and move it backward and forward to reveal a different part of it. Rolling and one-point ripple-trim operations change the edges of this "window", but Slip doesn't — the timeline clip stays the same length, and you just use a different part of it. </p>&#13;
			<p>Another handy example might help. Let's say you need to use a 4-second shot of a posed group of<a id="_idIndexMarker521"/> children. You've picked out a section of the shot in the middle that looks <a id="_idIndexMarker522"/>good. However, the client spots that near the end of the shot, one of the kids makes a rude gesture. You could fix this by switching to the <strong class="bold">Trim</strong> tool and dragging to the right, Slipping to an earlier part of the clip, and sending that gesture sailing into oblivion past the Out point.</p>&#13;
			<p>You'll need extra media to be able to Slip. Unsurprisingly, if you were to use an entire source clip on the Timeline, dragging with the Trim tool simply won't work. Both clip edges will be red, because there's no extra media to reveal or hide. (In the preceding clip, it's a shame I didn't start recording a few seconds earlier, because it could have been helpful to catch the boat entering the frame as well as leaving it. Editors &#13;
love options.)</p>&#13;
			<p>OK. You can now Roll and Slip. But there's one more trick to the <strong class="bold">Trim</strong> tool.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-227"><a id="_idTextAnchor235"/>Using a Slide edit</h2>&#13;
			<p>You can think of a<a id="_idIndexMarker523"/> Slide<a id="_idIndexMarker524"/> edit as a Roll with a clip in the middle. When you Slide, you move the dragged clip to the left or right, but the clip you're dragging only moves in time, and its contents stay the same. The Out point of the previous clip and the In point of the next clip are both changed, as if those two clips are rolling neighbors. The clip in the middle is repositioned within the timeline, but otherwise it's unchanged. So, how do you do it? Here's how:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>With the <strong class="bold">Trim</strong> tool (<strong class="bold">T</strong>) selected, hold <strong class="bold">⌥</strong> and click on the middle of a clip (not near the left or right edges) and drag sideways to perform a S<span>lide edit:</span></li>&#13;

			<p>Here, I'm <strong class="bold">⌥-dragging</strong> the second clip, meaning that the Wide clip before and the close-up clip after are adjusted in a Slide operation. For many editors, this isn't a very common task because it actually crosses over neatly into a common operation with connected clips. If the <a id="_idIndexMarker525"/>active clip in this example were above the other clips — a connected <a id="_idIndexMarker526"/>clip rather than a Primary Storyline clip — then moving the clip left or right would give the same results as Sliding on the Primary Storyline. It would look something like this:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer296" class="figure">&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.19: With a clip connected above, moving it sideways is a lot li<span>ke sliding</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Indeed, if I know I'm going to shift a clip around in time to get it just right, I'd connect it above, and so I don't Slide very often at all. But if you do Slide, you'll see a two-up display in the <strong class="bold">Viewer</strong>, just as you do with Roll and Slip. There's no two-up display when you move a connected clip. Another reason to choose to Slide is that it simplifies your timeline, keeping the number of vertical clips to a minimum. While one or two layers of connected clips aren't a problem, an edit is easier to understand at a glance if it's simple, and it also means you don't need as much screen space to see your entire timeline.</p>&#13;
			<p>As with Roll and Slip, there's no two-up display for nudging with the <strong class="bold">comma</strong> and <strong class="bold">period</strong> keys. But you'll need the mouse at some point: there's no keyboard shortcut that can prepare a clip for a Slip or Slide nudging operation. To prepare for a keyboard-based Slip or Slide, you'll have to press <strong class="bold">T</strong> to switch to the <strong class="bold">Trim</strong> tool, and then do the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Click</strong> on the middle of a clip to prepare for a Slip<span> operation</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">⌥-click</strong> on the<a id="_idIndexMarker527"/> middle<a id="_idIndexMarker528"/> of a clip to prepare for a Slide<span> operation</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Only then can you use <strong class="bold">comma</strong> and <strong class="bold">period</strong>, with or without <strong class="bold">⇧</strong>, to Slip or Slide by 1 or 10 frames.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-228"><a id="_idTextAnchor236"/>Review — Slipping and sliding clips</h2>&#13;
			<p>Slipping and sliding<a id="_idIndexMarker529"/> are crucial in that they enable you to make subtle edits without <a id="_idIndexMarker530"/>changing the overall timeline length. When you've built a complex timeline, you don't want to mess it all up to make an edit, and these tools mean you don't have to.</p>&#13;
			<p>All these techniques you've learned, including trimming with the regular <strong class="bold">Select</strong> tool and with the <strong class="bold">Trim</strong> tool, and whether you're using the mouse or the keyboard, are going to be much more useful once you start considering how they can be used with audio. Although FCP X does join video and audio components together in a single clip, it's actually very easy to trim a clip's audio independently, and that's what the next section is all about.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-229"><a id="_idTextAnchor237"/>Softening audio with split edits (J- and L-cuts)</h1>&#13;
			<p>Way back at the <a id="_idIndexMarker531"/>rough-cut stage, the emphasis was<a id="_idIndexMarker532"/> on making an edit sound good, and then to hide the edits with B-roll. That's still a great way to work, but <strong class="bold">split audio edits</strong> allow you to trim the audio and video components of a clip at different points from one another, allowing you to hear a speaker before you see them (J-cut) or hear them after you see them (L-cut). </p>&#13;
			<p>Cutting the audio and the video separately softens the edit, and (crucially) it's not something that's easy to do with simpler editing software. Using this technique will lift the quality of your edits, even if the client isn't quite sure why. You can see an illustration of this here:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer297" class="figure">&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.20: The rightmost clip here has expanded audio that starts before the video does<span> — a J-cut</span></p>&#13;
			<p>In this section, you'll<a id="_idIndexMarker533"/> learn how to expand and collapse<a id="_idIndexMarker534"/> audio, and some of the things you should avoid. You'll also learn how to blend audio from clip to clip, and how to fade audio in and out. First off, how to separate audio from video the right way.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-230"><a id="_idTextAnchor238"/>Expanding and collapsing audio</h2>&#13;
			<p>A clip in FCP X can<a id="_idIndexMarker535"/> contain <a id="_idIndexMarker536"/>audio, video, or both, and unlike most other <strong class="bold">non-linear editing systems</strong> (<strong class="bold">NLEs</strong>), it treats them as a single, united clip. That<a id="_idIndexMarker537"/> means that it's pretty hard to send anything out of sync — the audio will always line up with the video. In a traditional workflow, audio and video tracks start out stuck together but are easy to separate, and some new FCP X users might think that detaching the audio component entirely is a good way to emulate that. No, it isn't.</p>&#13;
			<p><em class="italic">Don't detach audio</em>, unless you have a really good reason. The <strong class="bold">Detach Audio</strong> command is there, under the <strong class="bold">Clip</strong> menu, but it's rarely the right way to go because it makes it far too easy to move a clip's audio out of sync. If the detached clip started life on the Primary Storyline, you're left with a video clip and a connected audio clip, which is OK, but it's trivially easy to move a connected clip. It's much worse if the detached clip was a connected clip, because you now have two separate clips connected to the same Primary Storyline clip, and you'll have to remember to select, move, and edit them together. Ugh all round.</p>&#13;
			<p>Instead, to separate the audio component of a clip temporarily, do the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Double-click on a clip's audio waveform in the timeline, or choose <strong class="bold">Clip</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Ex</strong><span><strong class="bold">pand Audio</strong></span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>When you expand audio like this, the audio part of a clip (the visible waveform) jumps down from the video. If this is the first time a clip has been expanded, the video and audio edges will be aligned, but they can all now be edited — trimmed or Rolled — separately. Trimming<a id="_idIndexMarker538"/> and Rolling is the key to softening edits. An example of an<a id="_idIndexMarker539"/> expanded audio clip can be seen in the following screenshot:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer298" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_8.21_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 8.21: The audio on these clips hasn't been detached, but it has been expanded"/>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.21: The audio on these clips hasn't been detached, but it has bee<span>n expanded</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Let's start with a practical example of how to create a J-cut. You'll need some kind of interview or presentation shot — someone speaking on camera. Take the &#13;
following steps:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Find a clip of someone speaking, select a region where the person is speaking, and place it in the Primary Storyline, as illustrated in the following s<span>creenshot:</span><div id="_idContainer299" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_8.22_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 8.22: Here's a suitable interview piece, with waveforms showing speech"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.22: Here's a suitable interview piece, with waveforms show<span>ing speech</span></p><p>You can spot the point where someone starts speaking by looking at the waveforms: taller means louder.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Find a b-roll clip that would be a suitable way to lead in to the f<span>irst shot.</span><p>A suitable b-roll could include a shot of that person walking or talking to another person, or whatever they're talking about.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Place the b-roll clip before the speaking clip in the Primary Storyline, as illustrated in the following s<span>creenshot:</span><div id="_idContainer300" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_8.23_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 8.23: Here's a shot of this expert brewer's workplace, a suitable introduction"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.23: Here's a shot of this expert brewer's workplace, a suitable in<span>troduction</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Double-click the audio waveform of the speaking clip to expand <span>its audio.</span><p>At this point, you <a id="_idIndexMarker540"/>might be tempted to drag the audio In point of the speaking<a id="_idIndexMarker541"/> clip to the left, extending it underneath the first clip. Unfortunately, this just makes the clip's audio start earlier, and since you've already chosen the right audio, this would add some unwanted audio (noise, silence, or extra dialogue) to the start of the clip. Instead, proceed as follows.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Drag the video In point of the speaking clip to the right, to make it st<span>art later.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>This does what you want. It moves the start of the audio back to under the first b-roll clip, and the person can now be heard before you see them. Zooming in for detail, you can see the following:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer301" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_8.24_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 8.24: Drag the left video edge of the speaking clip to the right, and you'll create a J-cut"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.24: Drag the left video edge of the speaking clip to the right, and you'll crea<span>te a J-cut</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Technically, this is similar to connecting the b-roll clip above the Primary Storyline, but in practice, this is a much easier thing to manage. The Primary Storyline drives the edit, and you often want clips of people speaking to drive the edit. Expanding audio like this allows the right clips to be in charge, but still allows you to finesse the transitions between clips. There are many good reasons to want the audio of a clip to extend beyond its normal clip boundaries, and this is a good way to do it, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer302" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_8.25_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 8.25: Placing a silent connected clip above the start of a speaker gives a similar result"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.25: Placing a silent connected clip above the start of a speaker gives a simi<span>lar result</span></p>&#13;
			<p>An L-cut is much the <a id="_idIndexMarker542"/>same, but backward: you'd expand audio, then drag the Out point <a id="_idIndexMarker543"/>of a "talking" clip to the left, to let a following b-roll clip sit on top of the audio from the first one. This is a less common technique but is still useful, and it's illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer303" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_8.26_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 8.26: This is what an L-cut looks like"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.26: This is what an L-cut <span>looks like</span></p>&#13;
			<p>If you want to visually reunite expanded audio components, you can — through a feature called <strong class="bold">Collapse Audio</strong>. To use this, proceed as follows:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Double-click on a clip's audio waveform in the timeline, or choose <strong class="bold">Clip</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Coll</strong><span><strong class="bold">apse Audio</strong></span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Note that collapsing audio doesn't change how anything sounds, but it can look like a little odd. If the audio component of a clip doesn't overlap with its companion video, it will be hidden after collapsing. Here's an example of expanded audio that started and finished before the video component:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer304" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_8.27_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 8.27: Here's a clip with a J-cut at the start, and audio that finishes early"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.27: Here's a clip with a J-cut at the start, and audio that fini<span>shes early</span></p>&#13;
			<p>After collapsing the audio, this is the result:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer305" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_8.28_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 8.28: The sample clip after audio is collapsed will look different in the timeline but sound the same"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.28: The sample clip after audio is collapsed will look different in the timeline but soun<span>d the same</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Collapsed audio might be invisible, but it can still be heard, and for that reason, I tend to leave audio expanded if its length has been adjusted. Expanded audio will always keep its current length, so if <a id="_idIndexMarker544"/>you adjust the video component of a clip, nothing <a id="_idIndexMarker545"/>happens. However, a collapsed clip will remember any offset that its audio start and end points had while expanded, and any offset will be maintained if you trim the clip's unified start or end points after collapsing. This can mean that you would hear a different part of the clip, which may or may not be an issue.</p>&#13;
			<p>If you're confused just where the audio is and want to expand everything, select the whole timeline (<strong class="bold">⌘A</strong>) and use the shortcut (<strong class="bold">⌃S</strong>) to perform <strong class="bold">Clip</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Expand Audio</strong> for all clips at once. Conversely, repeat the <strong class="bold">⌃S</strong> shortcut to <strong class="bold">Collapse Audio</strong> for all clips if you want to simplify. (There are additional tricks regarding separating audio clips into their separate components, and we'll return to them later in the book.)</p>&#13;
			<p>As well as enabling J-cuts and L-cuts, expanding audio also allows you to create audio fades between two clips, and it's certainly the method that gives you the most control. Read on!</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-231"><a id="_idTextAnchor239"/>Overlapping audio edit points</h2>&#13;
			<p>When you've taken out <a id="_idIndexMarker546"/>part of a clip of a person talking or want to run two clips of different people together, you'll probably want to slightly overlap the audio of the two clips to avoid problems. If there's a gap between the two clips, there can be an audible dip in volume as the background noise disappears, but with an overlap, this simply won't happen. Of course, some clips are easier to edit than others, and you'll experience many different issues in different jobs. Have a look at the following screenshot:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer306" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_8.29_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 8.29: The selected waveform region is &quot;ah, you know&quot;, which can be removed"/>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.29: The selected waveform region is "ah, you know", which can <span>be removed</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Overlapping two edits is often necessary to smooth out the edges of words, especially if you're having to extract good words that were said right next to bad words. If you've taken out a few extraneous words (an "um," an "ah," or more) from a single person's speech to create a tighter soundbite, you should find this process fairly simple, and it's been made easier with <em class="italic">a new feature </em><em class="italic">in 10.4.9</em>:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Use the <strong class="bold">Range Selection</strong> tool to select the unwanted part <span>of a clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">delete</strong> to <span>remove it.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Select both clips at once, then press <strong class="bold">⌥T</strong> (or <strong class="bold">Modify</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Adjust Audio Fades</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Crossfade</strong>) to add a <span><strong class="bold">Crossfade</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>The clip's <strong class="bold">fade handles</strong> are now activated, and the two clips are overlapped by a duration set in <strong class="bold">Preferences</strong>, under <strong class="bold">Editing</strong>. That might be enough; you can play it back to see whether it sounds good. From there, you can adjust the results with a more manual process if you wish:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Expand the audio on each of the audio <span>waveforms.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Trim the audio components to include exactly the sections you wa<span>nt to use.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Trim the video components to adjust the timing and how the audio clip<span>s overlap.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Connect a B-roll cutaway above to disguise the<span> jump cut.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>Don't be dishonest, but also don't be afraid to make a speaker sound smoother or more professional. Tweak as much as you want to — the cutaway hides all that mess. Edits like this are common:</p>&#13;

			<p>With or<a id="_idIndexMarker547"/> without a <strong class="bold">Crossfade</strong>, you can access and adjust those built-in fade handles on any audio clip. How? Read on.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-232"><a id="_idTextAnchor240"/>Fading audio edits</h2>&#13;
			<p>As you've seen, adding <a id="_idIndexMarker548"/>a Crossfade exposes a clip's fade handles, but every audio edge contains the same built-in fade handles. They allow you to fade that audio in or out and are a vital part of making audio edits seamless. Audio fades are also a good way to create a smooth transition between one music track and another.</p>&#13;
			<p>To access a clip's fade handles:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Hover over the left or right edge of an audio waveform until you see a<span> teardrop.</span><p>Hovering over this teardrop shows a cursor with two separated black arrows pointing left and right, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p><p class="figure-caption"> </p><div id="_idContainer308" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_8.31_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 8.31: This is the teardrop you're looking for; audio can be expanded or collapsed"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.31: This is the teardrop you're looking for; audio can be expanded or<span> collapsed</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Click on the teardrop and drag it toward the middle of the clip, until you reach the desired duration (if the clip's edge moves, <strong class="bold">Undo</strong> and try again), as illustrated in the following s<span>creenshot:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer309" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_8.32_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 8.32: The fade on the Out point here helps the audio smoothly fade away"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.32: The fade on the Out point here helps the audio smoothly<span> fade away</span></p>&#13;
			<p>You should use fades on almost every audio edit, to make sure that every audio clip starts in silence and ends <a id="_idIndexMarker549"/>in silence. If an audio clip cuts in the middle of a noise, you can sometimes hear a click or a pop as the audio cuts in. To make applying audio fades easier, you can apply shortcuts (with <strong class="bold">Final Cut Pro</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Commands &gt; Customize</strong>, <strong class="bold">⌥⌘K</strong>) to the following otherwise hidden commands:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Apply A</strong><span><strong class="bold">udio Fades</strong></span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Remove A</strong><span><strong class="bold">udio Fades</strong></span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Toggle Aud</strong><span><strong class="bold">io Fade In</strong></span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Toggle Audi</strong><span><strong class="bold">o Fade Out</strong></span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>These commands use the default <strong class="bold">Audio Fade</strong> length, which, alongside the <strong class="bold">Crossfade</strong> length, you can define in <strong class="bold">Preferences</strong>, in the <strong class="bold">Editing</strong> pane. Either or both of these can be set to a very short duration if you wish, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer310" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_8.33_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 8.33: The Editing pane in Preferences, where you can define the Audio Fade and Crossfade duration"/>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.33: The Editing pane in Preferences, where you can define the Audio Fade and Crossfad<span>e duration</span></p>&#13;
			<p>While the handles are the same on each clip, a Crossfade defaults to the <strong class="bold">S-curve</strong> fade style, and a standard <a id="_idIndexMarker550"/>clip's edges will default to <strong class="bold">+3dB</strong>. You can choose your own style with a right-click on the handle:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer311" class="figure">&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.34: Fade handles usually default to the +3dB style, but a Crossfade defaults <span>to S-curve</span></p>&#13;
			<p>So how long should a fade handle last for? The only hard and fast rule is "as long as it sounds good," but truly, this is context-dependent. Normally, I keep fades fairly short as a rule, but when I'm blending two clips together, I just make sure that there's some kind of overlap between tracks to avoid an awkward silence. Even if you regard yourself as a visual editor first, don't be afraid to dip your toes into audio.</p>&#13;
			<p>A fade-in should look like this:</p>&#13;

			<p>Experiment: add some foley effects and atmosphere from the <strong class="bold">Sound Effects</strong> library, and keep playing until<a id="_idIndexMarker551"/> you're happy. Because sound effects use a different Role, you'll notice they are shown in a different color:</p>&#13;

			<p>You'll find that the more elements you have in the mix, the easier it is to disguise the start or finish of any one element. Don't forget to adjust the relative volume of clips by dragging their volume line up and down, and there's a lot more detail on audio coming up in <a href="B15343_14_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor404"><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em></a>, <em class="italic">Boost the Signal: Audio S</em><em class="italic">weetening</em>.</p>&#13;

			<p>Music can benefit from <a id="_idIndexMarker552"/>a slightly different technique, including fades that might be quick or last several seconds. Sometimes you need to change tempo quickly, and elsewhere you'll need a pretty hard cut, exploding into the next scene with a visible and audible bang. Here's a nice trick if you need to repeat a piece of music that's too short:</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.41: Beat-matched and faded for a seamless mu<span>sic repeat</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Multiple music clips can be beat-matched pretty easily this way, and this approach is far more flexible than just fading one clip out and another clip in. Sound effects don't need the same treatment as they can usually sit independently, but remember to use only the part of a sound effect that you need (sometimes they're quite long), and do fade them out when they're no longer wanted.</p>&#13;
			<p>All kinds of trims, audio, and video, can be performed with the mouse, or with the <strong class="bold">comma</strong> and <strong class="bold">period</strong> nudging shortcuts, though they move by a full frame. If you want to perform audio<a id="_idIndexMarker556"/> subframe Slip edits with the keyboard, use <strong class="bold">⌥comma</strong> and <strong class="bold">⌥period</strong>, and add <strong class="bold">⇧</strong> if you want to go faster.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-234"><a id="_idTextAnchor242"/>Review — softening audio with split edits (J- and L-cuts)</h2>&#13;
			<p>We started out by<a id="_idIndexMarker557"/> dragging the mouse to edit a single edge of a united video/audio clip, but it's more complex now, and that's a good thing. Split edits are one of the easiest ways to up your production values, and in an era where simple phone-based editing is becoming more common, if you can use a more advanced technique to tell a story in a better way, you'll stand out for the right reasons.</p>&#13;
			<p>There are still more ways to work if you want to move a clip or an edit by a specific number of frames, or if you want to cut in a more defined, careful way. That's up next.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-235"><a id="_idTextAnchor243"/>Editing numerically and with the Precision Editor</h1>&#13;
			<p>Not every editor will want to be precise; editing is, after all, an art more than it is a science. But from <a id="_idIndexMarker558"/>time to time, it can be useful to set the length of a clip (or all your clips) to a specific value, and if a client asks for "a second more on that clip", it's great to be able to achieve it in a click and four quick keystrokes (<strong class="bold">+, 1, period, return</strong>). The techniques you'll learn here cover editing with numbers, setting duration precisely, and looking deeper with the Precision Editor.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-236"><a id="_idTextAnchor244"/>Trimming using numbers</h2>&#13;
			<p>While<a id="_idIndexMarker559"/> the <strong class="bold">comma</strong> and <strong class="bold">period</strong> shortcuts move a selected edit point (or clip) by a single frame, you can use <strong class="bold">plus</strong> and <strong class="bold">minus</strong> with timecodes to move by any amount. To illustrate how to respond to the client who asks for "a second more," follow these steps:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Select an Out point on one of your clips, a<span>s follows:</span><div id="_idContainer319" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_8.42_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.42: "One more second of barnya<span>rd noises"</span></p><p>You could do this by simply clicking on the Out point, or by moving the playhead to that point with keys, then selecting it with the <strong class="bold">]</strong> shortcut. While <strong class="bold">]</strong> selects the Out point, use <strong class="bold">[</strong> to select the In point, or <strong class="bold">\</strong> to select both for a Roll edit.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Type <strong class="bold">+100</strong>, then <strong class="bold">return</strong>, which will result in the following timecod<span>e display:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer320" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_8.43_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.43: The timecode display under the vi<span>ewer will </span>&#13;
change when you ty<span>pe the "+"</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Movements to the right use a <strong class="bold">plus</strong>, and to the left use a <strong class="bold">minus</strong>. Timecode entry is interpreted <a id="_idIndexMarker560"/>differently, depending on how many characters you type, as follows:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>If you enter one or two digits, you're talking <span>in frames.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>If you enter three or four digits, the first two digits are seconds and the last two a<span>re frames.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>If you enter five or six digits, the first two digits are minutes, the next two are seconds, and the last two a<span>re frames.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>If you enter a period (.), it counts as two ze<span>ros: "00".</span></li>&#13;
				<li>If you enter a number greater than the number of units available (such as 80 frames or 65 seconds), then the extra amount is converted to the nex<span>t unit up.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>In the timecode display underneath the Viewer, you'll see the result calculate itself as you type. Here are a few examples:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">+215</strong> = move the selected edit point 2 seconds and 15 frames to<span> the right</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">+265</strong> = move the <a id="_idIndexMarker561"/>selected edit point 4 seconds and 15 frames to the right (in a 25 <strong class="bold">frames per second</strong> (<strong class="bold">FPS</strong>) timeline, where 2 seconds and 65 frames = 4 seconds + 1<span>5 frames) </span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">-50</strong> = move the selected edit point 50 frames to the left (just over or just under two seconds, depending on the f<span>rame rate)</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">-2.</strong> = move the selected edit point 2 seconds to the left (in any f<span>rame rate)</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">+5..</strong> = move the selected edit point 5 minutes to<span> the right</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Depending on which edit point you select, either plus or minus could make a clip longer or shorter. In points moving to the left make a clip longer, as do Out points moving to the right. Roll edits, of course, make one clip longer while another gets shorter, so select the edi<a id="_idIndexMarker562"/>t point(s) however you wish, and then type away. Have a look at the following screenshot:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer321" class="figure">&#13;

and a half secon<span>ds sooner"</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Moving a clip rather than an edit works in exactly the same way, but beware. Connected clips can move freely, but if you move a Primary Storyline clip with numbers, you'll be performing a Slide operation, stealing time from one clip and giving it to the clip on the other side.</p>&#13;
			<p>No matter what you want to move, you can use the following general-purpose precision workflow:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Select an edit point on one of your clips with the <strong class="bold">Select</strong> tool, select two edit points with the <strong class="bold">Trim</strong> tool, or select a w<span>hole clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Type <strong class="bold">plus</strong> or <strong class="bold">minus</strong>, then a timecode, th<span>en </span><span><strong class="bold">return</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>It's also possible<a id="_idIndexMarker563"/> to define the duration of a clip using numbers.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-237"><a id="_idTextAnchor245"/>Setting clip duration</h2>&#13;
			<p>What if your client<a id="_idIndexMarker564"/> asks for a clip to be not "a second longer" but "exactly 4 seconds"? That's easy, but you'll need to use something other than <strong class="bold">plus</strong> or <strong class="bold">minus</strong>. The command is <strong class="bold">Modify</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Change Duration</strong> but you'll use <strong class="bold">⌃D</strong>. To set duration, do the following:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Select one or m<span>ore clips.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Type <strong class="bold">⌃D</strong>, then a timecode (without <strong class="bold">⌃</strong>), then <strong class="bold">return</strong>. This will result in the following timecod<span>e display:</span></li>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.45: The timecode readout under the Viewer changes to show the new duration; this is "2.<span>" or "200"</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Here are some examples, remembering that you only hold <strong class="bold">⌃</strong> while pressing <strong class="bold">D</strong>, and you'll need to press <strong class="bold">return</strong> at the end of each one:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">⌃D4.</strong> = make the selected clip 4 seconds long, an absol<span>ute change</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">⌃D+2.</strong> = make the selected clip 2 seconds longer, a relat<span>ive change</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">⌃D1</strong> = make the selected clip 1 frame long — handy for time-lapses or animation<span> sequences</span></li>&#13;

			<p>Extending that a little further, you can very quickly fill a timeline with videos or stills of a certain length by selecting all the clips at once, and then do the following:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Press <strong class="bold">E</strong> to append to the<span> Timeline.</span></li>&#13;

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-238"><a id="_idTextAnchor246"/>Moving to a specific timecode</h2>&#13;
			<p>If you want to<a id="_idIndexMarker566"/> jump to a specific timecode on the timeline it's a similar process, but you'll need to activate the <strong class="bold">Move Playhead Position</strong> command before typing that timecode. The shortcut is <strong class="bold">⌃P</strong>, and should be followed immediately by a timecode in seconds and frames.</p>&#13;
			<p>If this is something you do often, I'd recommend assigning an alternative key for this command. In <strong class="bold">Final Cut Pro</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Commands</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Customize</strong>, you can search for "move playhead" in the top-right search field, then drag that command to any unused key. The <strong class="bold">clear</strong> key on the number pad of extended keyboards is unused, right next to all those convenient number keys, and if you assign it, you'll see this:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.48: Assigning this command to the "clear" key looks<span> like this</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The main reason you'd want to jump to a specific timecode is if you're given a paper edit with time references for changes. While best practice is to assign To Do Markers to track changes (coming up in <a href="B15343_10_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor271"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">Explore a Little: Compound Clips and Timeline Tricks</em>), if you're not going to add Markers, always remember to work from the end of a change list to the start, or you'll invalidate later timecodes with the first ripple<a id="_idIndexMarker567"/> edit you perform.</p>&#13;
			<p>One last handy way to perform edits precisely is in a different mode entirely — the Precision Editor.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-239"><a id="_idTextAnchor247"/>Using the Precision Editor</h2>&#13;
			<p>This separate editing <a id="_idIndexMarker568"/>mode provides a way to focus on just one edit at a time, to see how much additional media is available for the current edit, and to perform trims and Roll edits in existing and new ways. To enter this mode, simply double-click on an edit in your timeline, and to leave, press <strong class="bold">Escape</strong>.</p>&#13;
			<p>The timeline now splits in two, with a line of gray boxes indicating Primary Storyline edits in the middle of the screen. One edit is active at a time, and earlier clips are shown above while later clips are shown below. You can switch to different edits in your timeline by clicking on them or by using the following shortcuts: <strong class="bold">semicolon</strong> or <strong class="bold">↑</strong> to go back, <strong class="bold">apostrophe</strong> or <strong class="bold">↓</strong> to go forward. Have a look at the following screenshot:</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.49: Zooming out to see a wider timeline with several e<span>dit points</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Dragging on the gray boxes in the center of the current point performs a Roll edit, but in this mode, you can see what you'll be revealing because you can see the filmstrips for the unused parts<a id="_idIndexMarker569"/> of the prior and upcoming clips, as illustrated in the &#13;
following screenshot:</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.50: Drag the filmstrip, the edit points, or the gray box to perfo<span>rm an edit</span></p>&#13;
			<p>If you move the mouse up to access an Out point or down to access an In point, you can click and drag it left or right to perform a regular trim. Two less obvious ways to trim are to <em class="italic">drag on either side of the upper or lower filmstrip</em> to move the In or Out point, or even just <em class="italic">click on the filmstrip</em> to set that point as the new In or Out point. And all the nudging (<strong class="bold">comma</strong>, <strong class="bold">period</strong>), edge-selecting (<strong class="bold">[</strong>, <strong class="bold">]</strong>, <strong class="bold">\</strong>), <strong class="bold">Trim Start</strong>, <strong class="bold">Trim End</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Play Around Edit</strong> (<strong class="bold">⌥[</strong>, <strong class="bold">⌥]</strong>, <strong class="bold">⇧/</strong>) shortcuts work here too.

			<p>While some people<a id="_idIndexMarker570"/> simply never use this mode, it's a great way to visually verify every edit in your timeline. Also, if you're reviewing an edit with a client who really wants to know which media lies unseen, this is a great way to show them you're making the right choices. Still, if you don't like it, don't use it.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-240"><a id="_idTextAnchor248"/>Review — editing numerically and with the Precision Editor</h2>&#13;
			<p>Precision editing<a id="_idIndexMarker571"/> helps you achieve precise results. Whether you use it yourself to quickly give a series of clips the same duration, or use it with clients so that they understand why an edit can only be the way it is, you'll probably want to use these techniques pretty regularly. The keyboard-based tricks have an added benefit: while most onlookers can understand what's happening when you adjust clips with your cursor, using the keyboard's precision adjustments makes you look like a wizard. To you, the program will simply get out of the way, and you'll be working at the speed of thought.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-241"><a id="_idTextAnchor249"/>Summary</h1>&#13;
			<p>Hopefully, this chapter has opened your eyes a little to what a modern editing program can do. If you've come from iMovie, this is probably the point where you realized just how much more power you have here. Rolling, Slipping, advanced keyboard trimming, and number-based edits are just some of the features you've now learned, and mastering these will give you new solutions to the problems you'll encounter as an editor.</p>&#13;
			<p>The next chapter expands your options further, showing you how to work with multicam footage, how to replace one clip with another, and how to use the unique Auditions feature to give you additional flexibility — especially handy with clients who don't know what they want yet.
