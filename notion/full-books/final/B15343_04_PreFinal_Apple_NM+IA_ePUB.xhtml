			<p class="author-quote">"Deceptively uncluttered, the Final Cut Pro X interface allows me to focus on creating compelling<span> content."</span></p>&#13;
			<p class="author-quote-source">— Sean Lander, editor, producer, and shooter based in Melbourne, Australia (<a href="http://www.rednail.com.au">www.rednail.com.au</a>)</p>&#13;
			<p>Now that you have a Library full of footage, it's time to make sense of it. Spending time organizing your footage now means that you'll be able to make better choices later, and the larger a project is, the more you will appreciate being able to find clips easily. This chapter will show you how to review your footage in many smart ways and then how to sort out your footage using Keywords.</p>&#13;
			<p>Don't skip or shortcut this chapter by skipping straight to editing — it's really important to understand this key process. Keywords are one of the key innovations of Final Cut Pro X, and understanding how metadata can help you find the right shot is crucial. Learn it, and you'll love it.</p>&#13;
			<p>Specifically, this chapter covers the following topics:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Reviewing <span>your media</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Browser vi<span>ew options</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Playback<span> shortcuts</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Examinin<span>g metadata</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Understanding and applyin<span>g Keywords</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Searching wit<span>h Keywords</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>By the end, you'll know how to look through all your clips efficiently, decide how they could best be categorized, and then apply those Keyword tags to your clips. In future chapters, you'll break things down further, separating parts of clips, but for now, we'll take a high-level view. Time to start, with <em class="italic">reviewing</em>.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-111"><a id="_idTextAnchor114"/>Reviewing your media</h1>&#13;
			<p>You <a id="_idIndexMarker259"/>probably already know that the <strong class="bold">spacebar</strong> performs the crucial play/pause function, but there's a lot more to reviewing media than that. Skimming is a critical skill, and the Viewer has many subtle controls too. Let's begin by finding out why you shouldn't click so much.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-112"><a id="_idTextAnchor115"/>Skimming is awesome</h2>&#13;
			<p>Probably the first<a id="_idIndexMarker260"/> habit that most editors need to break when shifting to FCP X is that of clicking. There's simply no need to click on a clip before playing it back, and in fact, it can cause issues if that click turns into an accidental drag and changes the current selection. Instead, simply <em class="italic">hover your cursor over a clip's filmstrip, just before a particular moment, then press the</em><em class="italic"> </em><strong class="bold">spacebar</strong>.</p>&#13;
			<p>FCP X actually has two ways to indicate a position in time: the <strong class="bold">Playhead</strong> and the <strong class="bold">Skimmer</strong>. Over a clip's filmstrip in the Browser, you'll see the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Playhead</strong> is a <a id="_idIndexMarker261"/>white vertical line, is positioned with a click, and stays in position when the mouse cursor moves <span>elsewhere.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Skimmer</strong> is a red vertical line, moves with the mouse cursor, and is only visible when the cursor hovers ov<span>er a clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Skimmer</strong> can be toggled on or off (blue means on) with this central toolbar button, or the <strong class="bold">S</strong><span> shortcut:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer110" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_4.1_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 4.1: This blue icon indicates that skimming is on"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.1: This blue icon indicates that skim<span>ming is on</span></p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>If it's present, <em class="italic">the Skimmer takes priority</em> over the<span> Playhead.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Because the Skimmer<a id="_idIndexMarker262"/> can move through a clip as quickly as you can drag your pointer over its filmstrip, most users find the Skimmer to be very useful. The thumbnail that the cursor is currently over will change to reflect the exact frame that the cursor is over, and you'll also see the full size of the frame in the Viewer. If you don't like skimming, you can simply press <strong class="bold">S</strong> to disable it, but if you only have a problem with the audio, you can disable audio skimming with the next icon along, or by pressing <strong class="bold">⇧S</strong>:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer111" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_4.2_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 4.2: Skimming on, Audio Skimming off"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.2: Skimming on, Audio Sk<span>imming off</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The Skimmer <a id="_idIndexMarker263"/>is also a powerful incentive to learn common shortcuts, because if you have to click on a button to perform an action, your cursor will leave the current pane, and the Skimmer will disappear. If you don't want to learn shortcuts, you'll have to click to explicitly set the Playhead position instead.</p>&#13;
			<p>As you skim, and as you click to position the Playhead, you'll probably be watching the Viewer, so it's time to look deeper.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-113"><a id="_idTextAnchor116"/>Exploring the Viewer</h2>&#13;
			<p>While the Skimmer and the Playhead do visibly update a thumbnail within a clip's filmstrip, the Viewer<a id="_idIndexMarker264"/> is larger and easier to see. While it can show video in a variety of ways, for now, only a subset of these options are important, and most of them are found in the menus at the top right of the Viewer pane:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer112" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_4.3_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 4.3: The Viewer, with the most important menus at the top right"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.3: The Viewer, with the most important menus at the<span> top right</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The first menu controls the <a id="_idIndexMarker265"/>size of the video, and you'll want to use shortcuts for these operations. Click once in the Viewer to target it, then try the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">⌘plus</strong> to zoom in (technically, this is really the e<span>quals key)</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">⌘minus</strong> to<span> zoom out </span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">⇧Z</strong> to fit the video to the space<span> available</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>This last option is persistent, so when you've chosen <strong class="bold">Fit</strong>, you can resize the Viewer by dragging its edges, and the video will resize to match:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer113" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_4.4_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 4.4: When the Timeline and Inspector are hidden, there's plenty of space for a big Viewer"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.4: When the Timeline and Inspector are hidden, there's plenty of space for a <span>big Viewer</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Normally, this <strong class="bold">Fit</strong> view is the best<a id="_idIndexMarker266"/> choice to make the video as large as possible, but you might prefer to view it at <strong class="bold">100% </strong>to see the pixels that you shot exactly. If you're using a 5K iMac, it's surprising to see just how few pixels a Full HD 1080p image takes up.</p>&#13;
			<p>The second menu shows or hides overlays and adjusts the video quality. It has several sections, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer114" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_4.5_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 4.5: The View menu in the Viewer"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.5: The View menu in <span>the Viewer</span></p>&#13;
			<p>In turn, they are as follows:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Show</strong>, which adds or <a id="_idIndexMarker267"/>removes an additional pane to the Viewer — <strong class="bold">Video Scopes</strong>, <strong class="bold">Angles</strong> for Multicam Clips, or the <strong class="bold">360° Viewer</strong> for working with equirectangula<span>r footage.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Quality</strong>, which lets you choose between <strong class="bold">Better Quality</strong> (everything you shot) and <strong class="bold">Better Performance</strong> (a lower-quality version that plays smoothly, but at ½ or ¼ re<span>solution).</span><p>Start out with the <strong class="bold">Quality</strong> menu set to <strong class="bold">Better Quality</strong>, but switch to <strong class="bold">Better Performance</strong> if your Mac starts to stutter on playback. Stuttering means that either your hard drive is too slow (unlikely) or your computer is too slow to process this particular video clip in real time (more likely). While most common formats won't cause any issues on most Macs, if you're working with something more exotic or you're using an underpowered laptop, this could happen. You could also consider shooting with a different codec (discussed in <a href="B15343_02_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor044"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Before the Edit: Production Tips</em>) or transcoding your footage (discussed in <a href="B15343_03_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor084"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Bring It In: Importing Your Footage</em>) to make processing easier.</p></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Media</strong>, which lets you choose between <strong class="bold">Optimized/Original</strong>, <strong class="bold">Proxy Preferred</strong>, and <strong class="bold">P</strong><span><strong class="bold">roxy Only</strong></span><span>.</span><p>The first option will show <strong class="bold">Optimized</strong> if it's available, or <strong class="bold">Original</strong> (native) footage if you haven't transcoded. The second option, <strong class="bold">Proxy Preferred</strong>, shows proxy footage if it's available, and optimized/original if it's not. This is probably the one to go for if you're working with proxy media, because the third option, <strong class="bold">Proxy Only</strong>, will show a "missing media" warning for clips with no proxy available. Either way, if you do edit with proxy media, be sure to switch this back to <strong class="bold">Optimized/Original</strong> before exporting (though you'll be warned if you forget).</p></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Channels</strong>, which lets <a id="_idIndexMarker268"/>you see individual components of the image, including <strong class="bold">Alpha</strong> transparency if available. Note that proxy media doesn't include an alpha channel, so if your footage includes transparency, don't create proxy medi<span>a from it.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Overlays</strong>, which adds guides on top of the image to help you maintain broadcast standards, line up your titles, or get horizons<span> straight.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Display</strong>, which can show both fields in an interlaced signal and also display <strong class="bold">High Dynamic Range</strong> (<strong class="bold">HDR</strong>) data using <a id="_idIndexMarker269"/>its r<span>aw values.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Range Check</strong>, which shows warnings when a video is too bright or too saturated; good to see during color c<span>orrection.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Captions</strong>, to choose whether captions <span>are shown.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>If you're using a second display, remember that you can use the button near the top-right corner to activate that display, then use the menu next to the button to decide what goes on it. This button/menu combo is only shown if a second display is connected and not set to mirror the first:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer115" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_4.6_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 4.6: The button here is lit blue, indicating that a second display is active; the menu next door chooses what is shown on it"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.6: The button here is lit blue, indicating that a second display is active; the menu next door chooses what is s<span>hown on it</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The Viewer is an <a id="_idIndexMarker270"/>obvious choice, and leaves just the Browser and Inspector (if you need it) on the first screen. Some editors prefer to use a vertical screen for the Browser instead; that works too. As well as these second display options, you can entirely dedicate a display to raw video output.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-114"><a id="_idTextAnchor117"/>A/V Output</h3>&#13;
			<p>While it's possible to put the<a id="_idIndexMarker271"/> Viewer on a second display and enter fullscreen mode with the button in the bottom-right corner (or <strong class="bold">⇧⌘F</strong>), there's another way to show fullscreen video. In <strong class="bold">Final Cut Pro</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Preferences</strong>, under <strong class="bold">Playback</strong>, the last option at the bottom lets you choose an external display for <strong class="bold">A/V Output</strong>. Third-party external interfaces work, but any HDMI-connected display in a 4K, UHD, or 1080p resolution should work too.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">This isn't a Viewer, and no overlays or quality options apply here. Instead, this is a raw video output feed, intended for high-quality dedicated output, which could be a second display or even a dedicated third display.</p>&#13;
			<p>Here's the <strong class="bold">Preferences</strong> pane that holds <strong class="bold">A</strong><strong class="bold">/V Output</strong>:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer116" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_4.7_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 4.7: Under the Playback preferences, look for the A/V Output settings at the bottom"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.7: Under the Playback preferences, look for the A/V Output settings at <span>the bottom</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Once set up, <strong class="bold">A/V Output</strong> also needs to<a id="_idIndexMarker272"/> be activated, from <strong class="bold">Window</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">A/V Output</strong>. If you had previously put the <strong class="bold">Viewer</strong> on the same second display as <strong class="bold">A/V Output</strong>, the <strong class="bold">Viewer</strong> will now pop back over to the main screen, before a fullscreen output takes over that second display. This looks great, but it can be taxing on less powerful computers. You'll also still have a regular Viewer on the primary screen to show the regular overlays and controls.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-115"><a id="_idTextAnchor118"/>Review — reviewing your media</h2>&#13;
			<p>You'll use the <a id="_idIndexMarker273"/>Viewer at almost every moment, so it's important to make sure you've got control over what it shows you. You know what the Viewer can do, and you know how to skim across your footage too. To maximize screen space, you can hide &#13;
the Timeline when you don't need it, and you know how to make use of a second display too.</p>&#13;
			<p>Now that you can see your footage clearly — how do you control what clip you're looking at? Explore the settings in the Browser.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-116"><a id="_idTextAnchor119"/>Browser view options</h1>&#13;
			<p>The icons in the top-right corner of the <a id="_idIndexMarker274"/>Browser contain the same two buttons as in the Import window, along with a drop-down <strong class="bold">Clip Filtering</strong> menu on the left, and a search icon on the right. We'll cover all these soon:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer117" class="figure">&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">&#13;
Figure 4.8: Look for these items in the top-right corner of t<span>he Browser</span></p>&#13;
			<p>As in the Import window, you'll find a <strong class="bold">Filmstrip/List</strong> toggle button at the top-right:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer118" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_4.9_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 4.9: If you're in List view, the icon shows a filmstrip, and vice versa "/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.9: If you're in List view, the icon shows a filmstrip, and v<span>ice versa </span></p>&#13;
			<p>The icon indicates <em class="italic">not the current state, but what you'll switch to if you cl</em><em class="italic">ick on it:</em></p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">List</strong> view is ideal for visually repetitive A-roll, especially interviews, where the thumbnails aren't going to be very in<span>formative.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Filmstrip</strong> view is ideal for B-roll and anything else you can visu<span>ally scan.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>You'll flip between these views frequently, as they're both useful in specific circumstances. Let's dig deeper.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-117"><a id="_idTextAnchor120"/>List view</h2>&#13;
			<p>Here's an example of a good<a id="_idIndexMarker275"/> use for <strong class="bold">List</strong> view, with the filmstrip lightly blurred &#13;
for privacy:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer119" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_4.10_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 4.10: When you'd rather see data in columns than filmstrips, use List view"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.10: When you'd rather see data in columns than filmstrips, use<span> List view</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The single filmstrip at the top isn't terribly informative, but it doesn't have to be. The camera didn't move, and though the vision is important, I won't be picking out which parts to use and not to use based on what they look like. I might use the audio waveforms, and they're visible just under the video filmstrip. The higher the peaks, the louder the noise, and you can spot where speakers changed by looking for the gaps in the waveform. </p>&#13;
			<p>As well as situations where audio is most <a id="_idIndexMarker276"/>important, <strong class="bold">List</strong> view is a good place to be if you want to see common metadata, such as the clip duration or creation date, for several clips at once. The column headers at the top have many tricks:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>To sort by a column, click on the colu<span>mn header.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>To reverse a column's sort, click on the currently selected colu<span>mn header.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>To resize a column, drag the edge of its colu<span>mn header.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>To reorder columns, drag their column header to the left or right of other colum<span>n headers.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>To show or hide a column, right-click on the column header and choose <span>an option:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer120" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_4.11_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 4.11: If an option is ticked in this list, that column will be visible (Last Modified is new in 10.4.9)"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.11: If an option is ticked in this list, that column will be visible (Last Modified is new <span>in 10.4.9)</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Start</strong> and <strong class="bold">End</strong> columns might <a id="_idIndexMarker277"/>not be terribly useful if your camera starts every clip at a <strong class="source-inline">0:00:00:00</strong> timecode, but if your camera can use <em class="italic">Time of Day timecode</em> as mine does, these columns are more useful.</p>&#13;
			<p>As well as sorting with, hiding, showing, and rearranging columns, you can control the view using the drop-down menu shown here at the top right of the Browser:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer121" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_4.12_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 4.12: Browser options for List view"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.12: Browser options for<span> List view</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Clip Filtering</strong> menu, currently <a id="_idIndexMarker278"/>set to the <strong class="bold">All Clips</strong> option, is also important, and we'll be returning to it soon.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">Not all options are available in <strong class="bold">List</strong> view, but do note that you can group items if you want to (I usually don't) and can show or hide the audio waveforms with the checkbox near the bottom. <strong class="bold">Continuous Playback</strong> allows you to move from clip to clip automatically — when one clip ends, the next begins. This is handy for some things, and less handy for others.</p>&#13;
			<p>While <strong class="bold">List</strong> view is great when names and numbers are important, if what you can see in a clip is more important, it's time to toggle across to <strong class="bold">Filmstrip</strong> view for a more visual experience.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-118"><a id="_idTextAnchor121"/>Filmstrip view</h2>&#13;
			<p>Here's a good <a id="_idIndexMarker279"/>example of the kind of footage best seen in <strong class="bold">Filmstrip</strong> view — lots of B-roll and visual shots. You can tell at a glance whether the shot is static or not or if it pans or moves along, and you can see exactly what's in it:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer122" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_4.13_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 4.13: A Browser in Filmstrip view, showing many beach shots, with waveforms visible"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.13: A Browser in Filmstrip view, showing many beach shots, with wavefor<span>ms visible</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Because there are no columns, the drop-down menu at the top right of the Browser shows more options in <strong class="bold">Films</strong><strong class="bold">trip</strong> view:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer123" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_4.14_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 4.14: The Browser options for Filmstrip view"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.14: The Browser options for Film<span>strip view</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Grouping and<a id="_idIndexMarker280"/> sorting are both here, and I prefer the options in the preceding screenshot for jobs I've shot myself. Do you need waveforms? Only if the sound is important and you're willing to sacrifice the space (and a small amount of computer power) that they require. <strong class="bold">Continuous Playback </strong>is useful if you want to review a number of clips at once: set it going and sit back.</p>&#13;
			<p>Just like in the Import window, the top two sliders control the height of the video thumbnails and the duration of each individual thumbnail. You'll want to change these frequently to be able to see a greater number of clips at once or to see more frames from each clip. It's best to use shortcuts for these operations, and if you've clicked in the Browser to give it focus, they are as follows:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">⌘plus</strong> to zoom in (again, this is really the e<span>quals key)</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">⌘minus</strong> to<span> zoom out </span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">⇧Z</strong> to zoom all the way out to show a single thumbnail for each clip (the <strong class="bold">Al</strong><span><strong class="bold">l</strong></span><span> setting)</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Combined with skimming, these shortcuts will help you trade detail for quantity, allowing you to glance over all your footage quickly, or examine a clip more closely.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-119"><a id="_idTextAnchor122"/>Review – Browser view options</h2>&#13;
			<p>Between the <a id="_idIndexMarker281"/>different options for clip appearance, the <strong class="bold">List/Filmstrip</strong> toggle and the scale controls, you've got many different ways to see your clips. Set up your columns in <strong class="bold">List</strong> view however you wish, or flick across to Filmstrip mode for a birds-eye view, such as looking through all the strips of freshly processed film in a lab. Glance in the Browser at whatever size and scale you prefer, or if you want to see them in the Viewer, use the pointer to skim over your clips at whatever speed you like.</p>&#13;
			<p>But you don't have to use the mouse for playback. Many editors prefer the keyboard, and indeed, for longer clips, it's often the best approach. In the next section, I'll show you some of the best keyboard shortcuts for playback.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-120"><a id="_idTextAnchor123"/>Playback shortcuts</h1>&#13;
			<p>The <strong class="bold">spacebar</strong> (play/pause) is a<a id="_idIndexMarker282"/> great shortcut to start with, and as it's the largest key on the keyboard, it's easy to hit. But you'll need to know about a few more keys too because just starting and stopping playback isn't enough. To review a lot of footage, you might need to play it back much faster than normal. Conversely, when you need to be specific about the exact frame you want, you might want to play it back much slower. All that and more is coming right up.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-121"><a id="_idTextAnchor124"/>Basic shortcuts</h2>&#13;
			<p><strong class="bold">J,</strong> <strong class="bold">K</strong>, and <strong class="bold">L</strong> are the three keys you <a id="_idIndexMarker283"/>should mash firmly into your brain:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">L</strong> play<span>s forward.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">K</strong> pauses.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">J</strong> plays<span> backward:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer124" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_4.15_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 4.15: J, K, L: the keys you want to use every day"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.15: J, K, L: the keys you want to use<span> every day</span></p>&#13;
			<p>These keys work in the Viewer, in the Timeline, and even in QuickTime Player — they're probably the most important shortcuts you'll learn today. You can use these with your left or right hand, in combination with a mouse or trackpad, and be sure to leave your three fingers resting on these keys for repeated easy access. But there's more:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Repeatedly press <strong class="bold">J</strong> or <strong class="bold">L</strong> to double the playback speed in that direction: 2x speed, 4x speed, 8x speed, <span>and so on.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press the opposing <a id="_idIndexMarker284"/>playback key to jump instantly to 1x speed in the other <span>direction.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Using these common editing keys, you can tap <strong class="bold">L</strong> three times to instantly play at 4x the normal speed, or tap <strong class="bold">J</strong> two times for double reverse playback — a good way to review footage quickly or at least to get a quick overview of it. <strong class="bold">K</strong> has tricks too, which are as follows:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Hold <strong class="bold">K</strong> and then tap <strong class="bold">L</strong> to move a single fram<span>e forward.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Hold <strong class="bold">K</strong> and then tap <strong class="bold">J</strong> to move a single frame<span> backward.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Hold <strong class="bold">K</strong> and then hold <strong class="bold">J </strong>or <strong class="bold">L</strong> to play in slow motion with slowed-d<span>own audio.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>The horizontal arrow keys are important too:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">→</strong> moves forward <span>one frame.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">←</strong> moves back <span>one frame.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">⇧→</strong> moves forward <span>10 frames.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">⇧←</strong> moves back <span>10 frames.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Of course, <strong class="bold">spacebar</strong> still works to play or pause. All these keys also work with hovering, so you can hover to where you want to begin, then press <strong class="bold">J</strong> to play backward. If you click, rather than hover, you will also select the clip you clicked on. Finally, the vertical arrow keys can help here too:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">↓</strong> selects the <span>next clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">↑</strong> selects the prev<span>ious clip.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>If you prefer not to use<a id="_idIndexMarker285"/> Continuous Playback, you'll be using <strong class="bold">Up</strong> and <strong class="bold">Down</strong> quite a bit. Note that these keys do select the next or previous clip, while hovering doesn't. That may seem like a small thing, but you'll see soon why it matters.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-122"><a id="_idTextAnchor125"/>Extended shortcuts</h2>&#13;
			<p>To review a particular part of<a id="_idIndexMarker286"/> a clip, you can certainly hover or click just before a moment of interest, then simply play. But the following technique is often more useful:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Activate <strong class="bold">Looping</strong> with <strong class="bold">View</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Playback</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Loop Play</strong><span><strong class="bold">back</strong></span><span> </span><span><strong class="bold">(⌘L</strong></span><span>).</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">⇧/</strong> (also known as <strong class="bold">?</strong>, if you prefer) to <strong class="bold">Play Ar</strong><span><strong class="bold">ound Edit</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>This is a great way to repeatedly see part of a clip as the Playhead jumps a few seconds back, plays through the selected point, and plays a few seconds forward before starting again. It's useful in an edit on the Timeline too.</p>&#13;
			<p>If you often find yourself wanting to play at high speed, you might tire of repeatedly tapping <strong class="bold">L</strong> or <strong class="bold">J</strong>. There are some additional commands to instantly start playback &#13;
at high speed forward or backward, but they're hidden: they aren't in the menus, and they don't have keys assigned. To enable them, you'll need to assign custom keyboard shortcuts:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Choose <strong class="bold">Final Cut Pro</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Commands</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Customize</strong> (or <strong class="bold">⌥⌘K</strong>) to bring up the <strong class="bold">Comma</strong><span><strong class="bold">nd Editor</strong></span><span>:</span><div id="_idContainer125" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_4.16_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 4.16: The Command Editor allows visual customization of shortcut keys and is very helpful indeed"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.16: The Command Editor allows visual customization of shortcut keys and is very help<span>ful indeed</span></p></li>&#13;

			<p>Try these new<a id="_idIndexMarker289"/> shortcuts out! <strong class="bold">J</strong> plays backward, but <strong class="bold">⇧J</strong> plays immediately at 8x speed backward, and <strong class="bold">⇧L</strong> plays at 8x forward. Keyboard customization can really make a difference to how quickly you can edit, so spend a bit of time here once you understand the app a bit more. There are additional hidden shortcuts that revolutionize the color correction process, and they're covered in <a href="B15343_11_PreFinal_Apple_SK+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor296"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, <em class="italic">Play With Light: Color Correction an</em><em class="italic">d Grading</em>.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-123"><a id="_idTextAnchor126"/>Review — playback shortcuts</h2>&#13;
			<p>The core <strong class="bold">JKL</strong> keys are <a id="_idIndexMarker290"/>important, but so are all the arrows, as well as the spacebar, looping, and the modifier keys too. Shortcuts, especially single-key shortcuts, can speed you up like nothing else, so force yourself to use these as much as possible. You also know how to set up your own shortcut keys, another massive time saver.</p>&#13;
			<p>While quick playback is important, not everything can be seen at a glance. Deeper information about a clip is called metadata, and it can be very powerful. The next section tells you all about it.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-124"><a id="_idTextAnchor127"/>Examining metadata</h1>&#13;
			<p>As mentioned in <a href="B15343_03_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor084"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Bring It In: Importing Your Footage</em>, metadata is "data about data," and while it starts with the<a id="_idIndexMarker291"/> basics — the filename, creation date, frame size, and frame rate — there are hundreds of additional pieces of image data that can be explored. The columns available in <strong class="bold">List</strong> view are extensive, but they don't show all the information that can be stored inside a file. To see and potentially change some of this data, you'll have to use the Inspector, and we'll dig deeper this time.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-125"><a id="_idTextAnchor128"/>Metadata in List view</h2>&#13;
			<p>Metadata, in terms of camera-originated<a id="_idIndexMarker292"/> data attached to media files, can be pretty boring and technical, the kind of thing that a program needs to worry about, rather than you. Maybe you don't care much about the codec or color profile of every clip. But some of this info can help you to make intelligent choices by finding files with particular characteristics.</p>&#13;
			<p>The most commonly used metadata is available in the columns of <strong class="bold">List</strong> view, and sorting by any of these characteristics can help you find specific files:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Duration</strong>: If you need a clip long enough to fill a certain-sized hole in<span> your edit</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">File Type</strong>: If you want to separate video, audio, <span>and stills</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Video Frame Rate</strong>: If you want to easily find high frame-rate footage or identify frame rate <span>mismatches</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Frame Size</strong>: If you want extra data <span>to zoom in</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Codecs</strong>: To spot footage that could be harder to work wit<span>h natively</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Camera Name</strong>: Useful when setting up<span> multicams</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Shot/Scene/Reel</strong>: For organizing clips from lar<span>ger shoots</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>As you will see in the menu, there are other fields available, but these are the most commonly used.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-126"><a id="_idTextAnchor129"/>Metadata in the Inspector</h2>&#13;
			<p>Several additional fields are not available in the columns, and you'll have to use the Inspector to reach them. Here's how to <a id="_idIndexMarker293"/>optimize your workspace for the &#13;
organizing process:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">If the Timeline is still visible, hide it by pressing the middle button at the top right of the ma<span>in window:</span><div id="_idContainer130" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_4.21_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 4.21: The lighter Timeline icon here indicates that it is hidden"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.21: The lighter Timeline icon here indicates that it<span> is hidden</span></p><p><em class="italic">You don't need the Timeline while you're organizing footage</em>. Use its screen space for a bigger Browser instead.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Head to the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> and press the <strong class="bold">Info</strong> tab icon a<span>t the top:</span><p class="figure-caption">&#13;
</p><div id="_idContainer131" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_4.22_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 4.22: The Info button in blue is the one to click"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.22: The Info button in blue is the on<span>e to click</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>In the bottom-left corner of the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> pane, look at the metadata menu, which will probably say <strong class="bold">Basic</strong> o<span>r </span><span><strong class="bold">General</strong></span><span>:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer132" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_4.23_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 4.23: These are the default metadata views, though you can define your own"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.23: These are the default metadata views, though you can defin<span>e your own</span></p>&#13;
			<p>This menu controls which metadata fields are shown in the Inspector. No recording device will write data to every field, and FCP X won't read all the data in every kind of file. If you wish to inspect other data that is present, choose any of the other metadata views, or make your own<a id="_idIndexMarker294"/> custom compilation with <strong class="bold">Edit Metadata View</strong> from the same menu. If you can't find what you're looking for, you can even create entirely new metadata fields with <strong class="bold">Add Custom Met<a id="_idTextAnchor130"/>ad</strong><strong class="bold">ata Field</strong>.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">Many cameras write metadata to record aperture, ISO, white balance, and other settings that can't usually be read or shown in the Inspector — except when working with ProRes RAW. In fact, if you use the Import feature (rather than dragging and dropping), some of this extra metadata can become inaccessible. If you want to keep and view this information, consider a <a id="_idIndexMarker295"/>third-party app called <strong class="bold">EVR X</strong>.</p>&#13;
			<p>The main strength of the Inspector is not just in inspecting data, but also in changing settings and adding additional information through editable fields. Most of the interesting switches are collected in the Settings metadata view:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Video and Audio Roles</strong>: To describe the kind of footage<span> in a clip</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">360° Projection Mode</strong>: To indicate the type of 36<span>0° footage</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Field Dominance Override</strong>: To adjust interlacin<span>g settings</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Anamorphic Override</strong>: To squish footage shot with anamorp<span>hic lenses</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Deinterlace</strong>: To remove unwanted i<span>nterlacing</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Color Space Override</strong>: To force a particular color space, such as Rec. 709 or<span> Rec. 2020</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Camera LUT</strong>: To automatically<a id="_idIndexMarker296"/> correct footage shot in a variety of flat "Log" formats (more on that in <a href="B15343_11_PreFinal_Apple_SK+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor296"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, <em class="italic">Play with Light: Color Correction and</em><span><em class="italic"> Grading</em></span><span>):</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer133" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_4.24_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 4.24: An unexciting example of the Settings metadata view"/>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.24: An unexciting example of the Settings met<span>adata view</span></p>&#13;
			<p>If you don't know what all these settings do, that's fine — many lucky editors will never have to deal with interlaced footage in a progressive world. But if you ever need them, this is where they live. An entire shoot can often be corrected in one click because many selected clips can be changed at once.</p>&#13;
			<p>As well as these switches, several fields are designed to be filled in by you or (if you're lucky!) by an assistant editor:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Switch to the <strong class="bold">General</strong> or <strong class="bold">Extended</strong> metadata views to see <strong class="bold">Reel</strong>, <strong class="bold">Scene</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Take</strong>, as well as the <strong class="bold">Camera Name</strong> and <strong class="bold">Camera Angle</strong> fields used in multicam <span>workflows.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>These fields are the easiest to set in <a id="_idIndexMarker297"/>bulk in the Inspector (for example, a scene's worth of clips at a time) and then viewed through <strong class="bold">List</strong> view.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-127"><a id="_idTextAnchor131"/>Review — examining metadata</h2>&#13;
			<p>Whether you use the <a id="_idIndexMarker298"/>Inspector or the Browser's columns to inspect metadata, you'll find them invaluable for technical information and clip-level controls. Remember that while <strong class="bold">List</strong> view is convenient for common items, the different views available in the Inspector are where all the deeper details are hiding. </p>&#13;
			<p>While clip-level metadata is informative, it doesn't describe the content of clips. A description of the content of a clip (or part of a clip) is metadata, but it's the kind of metadata you'll mostly need to add on your own — and that's done with Keywords.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-128"><a id="_idTextAnchor132"/>Understanding and applying Keywords</h1>&#13;
			<p>The simplest way to get started with <a id="_idIndexMarker299"/>Keywords is to think of a simple one- or two-word description of your clips, something that will help you to find that clip again later. One common strategy is to focus on what's actually in the shot, such as water, trees, skies, people, or animals. Another strategy might focus on how the shots will be used: A-roll and B-roll, introductory shots, and conclusion shots. Perhaps focal length would be helpful: close up, medium shot, or long shot. There are many strategies that could succeed in different workflows and at different parts of the editing process. Yes, Keywords are metadata, but they are less about the technical aspects and more about the shot content, and they're stored in the Library, rather than on the media files themselves.</p>&#13;
			<p>Here's the big problem with the traditional "bin" structure, which is essentially just like putting files into specific folders (and subfolders) in the Finder. You can put clips into folders or bins that approximate one of these organizational strategies, but you can't do them all at the same time. You're also out of luck if a clip could be classed as two items of the same category: a shot with water and trees, for example, or if part of a clip has water and part of it has trees.</p>&#13;
			<p>Keywords solve all these problems because you can tag a clip with several Keywords at the same time, over its full length or just part of it. A single clip might have all these Keywords applied: water, trees, B-roll, people, long shot, and group shot. Crucially, FCP X can find this clip under any of these Keywords, not just in a single subfolder in a structure — it's a fantastic system and far superior to simple bins or folders.</p>&#13;
			<p>Before we get to the specifics, a little planning will go a long way to figure out the Keywords that will best apply to each job you do. First, think of categories (ways you might want to search for things), then think of the actual<a id="_idIndexMarker300"/> Keywords within each category. Here are some example categories with their relevant Keywords:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Shot content</strong>: <strong class="source-inline">water</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">trees</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">hands</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">buildings</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">abstract</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">grass</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">people</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">animals</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">boats</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">planes</strong>, or <strong class="source-inline">paper</strong>…this really does vary a lot depending on the kind of footage you're work<span>ing with. </span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Location</strong>: <strong class="source-inline">interior</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">exterior</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">stage</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">set</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">park</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">foyer</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">office</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">carpark</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">backlot</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">desert</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">lake</strong><span>, or </span><span><strong class="source-inline">field</strong></span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Script-based</strong>: <strong class="source-inline">reel</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">scene</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">shot</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">take</strong>, <span>or </span><span><strong class="source-inline">circled</strong></span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Focal length</strong>: <strong class="source-inline">extreme close up</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">close up</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">medium</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">head and shoulders</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">long</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">tele</strong>, or <strong class="source-inline">over th</strong><span><strong class="source-inline">e shoulder</strong></span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Planned usage</strong>: <strong class="source-inline">A-roll</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">B-roll</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">introduction</strong>, or <span><strong class="source-inline">conclusion</strong></span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Rights</strong>: <strong class="source-inline">royalty-free</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">royalty-paid</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">original</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">archival</strong><span>, or </span><span><strong class="source-inline">stock</strong></span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Legal Permissions</strong>: <strong class="source-inline">release signed</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">location release signed</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">parental release signed</strong>, or <strong class="source-inline">release no</strong><span><strong class="source-inline">t required</strong></span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">People</strong>: <strong class="source-inline">one person</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">two people</strong>, or <span><strong class="source-inline">group shot</strong></span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Selected shots</strong>: <strong class="source-inline">best</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">good</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">worst</strong>, or <strong class="source-inline">check c</strong><span><strong class="source-inline">ontinuity</strong></span><span> </span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>More importantly, you don't have to use all these strategies for every job. If you're editing a family holiday video, perhaps just a set of content Keywords are going to be most useful. For a trip to Venice, my content Keywords included <strong class="source-inline">accademia</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">canals</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">crowds</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">family</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">gondolas</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">piazza san marco</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">rooftops</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">streets</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">walking</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">water CU</strong> (<strong class="bold">close up</strong>):</p>&#13;

			<p>I found that I didn't need to add <a id="_idIndexMarker301"/>focal length or any other categorizations because for searching, content was enough. Don't think you need to prepare all the individual Keywords ahead of time; you can make them up as you go along. A rough plan of the categories you want to apply, and a few of the Keywords within them, will get you started.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-129"><a id="_idTextAnchor133"/>Applying Keywords to clips</h2>&#13;
			<p>Once<a id="_idIndexMarker302"/> you have a <a id="_idIndexMarker303"/>rough plan, it's time to add Keywords to your clips, and here's how:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">At the top left of the interface, find and press the <strong class="bold">Key</strong> button to open up the <strong class="bold">Keywords</strong> floati<span>ng window:</span><div id="_idContainer135" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_4.26_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 4.26: The title of the window will confirm which clip you're working on"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.26: The title of the window will confirm which clip you're <span>working on</span></p><p>This window can expand to show Keyword Shortcuts, but if you haven't used it before, it'll just show a single blank line. That's fine for now. </p></li>&#13;
				<li>Click <a id="_idIndexMarker304"/>on the first clip in your <strong class="bold">Event</strong> to <span>select it.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Keywords</strong> window, type the first <a id="_idIndexMarker305"/>Keyword that describes this clip, then press <strong class="bold">tab</strong>, <strong class="bold">comma</strong>, or <strong class="bold">return</strong> to finalize th<span>e Keyword:</span><div id="_idContainer136" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_4.27_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 4.27: When a Keyword is finalized, it's wrapped up in a blue box"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.27: When a Keyword is finalized, it's wrapped up in <span>a blue box</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>If you can think of another Keyword that could apply, repeat this process to add a second Keyword. They will then alphabetically sort themselves,<span> as shown:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">&#13;

			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer137" class="figure">&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.28: Alphabetical order will apply, no matter what order you add th<span>e Keywords</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Now that you've added a couple of Keywords, you'll have also created a couple of <strong class="bold">Keyword Shortcuts</strong> along the way automatically. To see them, do the following:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Click the disclosure triangle to the left of <strong class="bold">Keyword Shortcuts</strong> at the bottom of the <strong class="bold">Keywords</strong> window to show the <span>shortcuts:</span><div id="_idContainer138" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_4.29_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 4.29: The Keyword Shortcut fields here will be empty if you've never added Keywords on this Mac"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.29: The Keyword Shortcut fields here will be empty if you've never added Keywords o<span>n this Mac</span></p><p>Each Keyword you apply is also added to the persistent shortcut fields below, using shortcuts using the <strong class="bold">⌃</strong> key and the numbers: <strong class="bold">⌃1</strong> to <strong class="bold">⌃9</strong>. These are remembered, so if Keywords have been added to any Library on this Mac before now, you might see other shortcuts already here.</p><p>Those<a id="_idIndexMarker306"/> shortcut fields can be edited by clicking and typing directly, but changing shortcuts doesn't affect the current clip. The Keywords for the current clip are still shown at the top of the window and that doesn't change no matter what Keywords are shown in the shortcut fields.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">↓</strong> to move to the next clip and type <a id="_idIndexMarker307"/>new<span> Keywords.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>If you start typing the first letters of an existing Keyword, it will offer to autocomplete it — press <strong class="bold">comma</strong>, <strong class="bold">tab</strong>, or <strong class="bold">return</strong> to accept the suggestion, or keep typing somet<span>hing else.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Use the shortcut keys to apply existing Keywords. You can also click on the button next to the shortcut field if y<span>ou prefer.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">As you continue to assign Keywords to an entire shoot worth of shots, you might run out of shortcut slots — or they might already be taken up with previously added shortcuts. That's OK because you can edit those shortcut fields, removing less-used shortcuts and replacing them with more common ones. It's also possible to add multiple Keywords to a single shortcut if you want to. Keyword Shortcuts are also persistent, and every now and again you'll want to clear them out. Double-click on the first shortcut field to select it, then repeatedly press <strong class="bold">delete</strong> (to remove the current Keyword shortcut) and <strong class="bold">tab</strong> (to jump to the next field).</p>&#13;
			<p>As each new <a id="_idIndexMarker308"/>Keyword is created, a <strong class="bold">Keyword Collection</strong> will also be created in your Event, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 4.25</em>. Each one collects all the clips tagged with that Keyword — just click on a Keyword Collection to see all those clips together. Less obviously, Keyword Collections can also be used for assigning Keywords, like this:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Click the disclosure triangle to the left of an Event name to reveal all the Keyword Collections for t<span>hat Event.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Drag a clip into an existing Keyword<a id="_idIndexMarker309"/> Collection to apply that Keyword to <span>that clip.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>If you're curious about which exact Keywords have been added to a clip, you can do one of the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Open the <strong class="bold">Keywords</strong> window and check the<span> top line:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.32: The Keywords can be exposed in List view, but it's not as convenient as the oth<span>er methods</span></p>&#13;
			<p>You may also notice that clips with Keywords display a blue line across their thumbnail filmstrip. The blue line indicates that a Keyword has been added, and other colors are used to indicate other properties:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer142" class="figure">&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.33: Blue means a Keyword has been applied; green and orange are co<span>ming soon!</span></p>&#13;
			<p>If you want to add <a id="_idIndexMarker312"/>Keywords to everything (a good idea), you can visually scan these <a id="_idIndexMarker313"/>blue indicators to find clips that you haven't added Keywords to — but there's an even easier way of doing this.</p>&#13;
			<p>At the top of the Browser, find the <strong class="bold">Clip Filtering</strong> menu, which probably says <strong class="bold">All Clips</strong> or <strong class="bold">Hide Rejected</strong>. This menu changes which clips are currently shown, hiding those which don't satisfy the criteria:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Choose <strong class="bold">No Ratings or Keywords</strong> from the <strong class="bold">Clip Filte</strong><span><strong class="bold">ring</strong></span><span> menu:</span><p class="figure-caption">&#13;
</p><div id="_idContainer143" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_4.34_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 4.34: The Clip Filtering menu governs what you see in the Browser (ratings are coming soon!)"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.34: The Clip Filtering menu governs what you see in the Browser (ratings are com<span>ing soon!)</span></p><p>Now, you'll only see clips you haven't dealt with yet, and as you add Keywords to these clips, they will disappear from this view. It's important to realize that this will only help you add the first Keyword to each clip, and if you want to add multiple Keywords to each clip in your first pass through your clips, this will be counterproductive. When all the clips have Keywords, take the following step.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">All Clips</strong> from the <strong class="bold">Clip Filtering</strong> menu to show everything o<span>nce again.</span><p>If you now want to <a id="_idIndexMarker314"/>add additional Keywords to some of your clips, repeat the<a id="_idIndexMarker315"/> earlier steps. You can easily type additional Keywords into the <strong class="bold">Keywords</strong> window, use Keyword Shortcuts, or drag clips into Keyword Collections.</p></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>Here's one last super-speedy way to add Keywords:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">In the Browser, click <a id="_idIndexMarker316"/>on the background to make sure no clips are<span> selected.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Hover your cursor over a clip you want to add a Keyword to, but do<span>n't click!</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press a Keyword shortcut to add the matching Keyword(s) to <span>that clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Repeat the process, hovering and then tapping a Keyword shortcut over all the remain<span>ing clips.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">If you've accidentally clicked and dragged on part of a clip before applying a Keyword, only that part of the clip will have the Keyword applied. This can absolutely be a useful workflow, especially with longer clips, and we will tackle it soon. For now, if you have accidentally selected just part of a clip, you can remove a selection with <strong class="bold">⌥</strong><strong class="bold">X</strong>. If you've already added a Keyword to just part of a clip, you can select that Keyword instance in <strong class="bold">List view</strong> (under the disclosure triangle) and then delete it from the <strong class="bold">Keyword</strong> window.</p>&#13;
			<p>We'll look at selecting parts of clips in <a href="B15343_05_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor141"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Choose Your Favorites: Selecting, Rating, and Searching</em>. For now, let's make FCP X do some work for us!</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-130"><a id="_idTextAnchor134"/>Automatic tagging for people</h2>&#13;
			<p>While Final Cut<a id="_idIndexMarker317"/> Pro X can't suggest Keywords for the content of your clips, it will tag your clips with people-related analysis Keywords to tell you how many people are visible in a shot, and what kind of composition was used to record them. To create these Keywords, do the following:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Select some or all of your clips that feature people by clicking on one and <strong class="bold">⇧-clicking</strong> another, by <strong class="bold">⌘-clicking</strong> on separate clips, or by dragging a box around several clips. (If some clips do not feature people, they'll be<span> ignored.)</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Right-click and then choose <strong class="bold">Analyz</strong><span><strong class="bold">e and Fix</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;

				<li>Click on <strong class="bold">OK</strong>, and wait for the process to complete by watching the circle-based progress indicator or the <strong class="bold">Background Tas</strong><span><strong class="bold">ks</strong></span><span> window:</span></li>&#13;

			<p>When the <a id="_idIndexMarker318"/>analysis is complete, <strong class="bold">Analysis Keywords</strong> (a purple bar below the blue one) will have been applied to the clips where people have been detected. You'll also see a new folder within your Keyword Collections called <strong class="bold">People</strong>. Inside it, you'll see small "cog" icons, Smart Collections, which collect shots of particular types, such as <strong class="bold">Group</strong>, <strong class="bold">Medium Shot</strong>, <strong class="bold">One Person</strong>, and so on, as follows:</p>&#13;

			<p>If you're<a id="_idIndexMarker319"/> following along with your own footage, you might get different results. Make sure to analyze different shots of people to see a variety of results. The folder is something you can also create on your own, with <strong class="bold">File</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">New</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Folder</strong>. This folder isn't a bin, though: here, a folder is for organizing Keyword Collections. You can add as many folders as you wish — if you've added enough Keywords to make that worthwhile, of course.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-131"><a id="_idTextAnchor135"/>Review — understanding and applying Keywords</h2>&#13;
			<p>Now, you know why <a id="_idIndexMarker320"/>Keywords are important, and how to add your own Keywords by typing, by using shortcuts, by dragging into Keyword Collections, and even how to get the app to add people-related Keywords for you.</p>&#13;
			<p>Keywords are a big deal: effectively, Keywords are the difference between a carefully cataloged bookshelf and a loose pile of books on the floor. Without Keywords, you'll spend a lot of time repeatedly viewing the same media as you try to find what you're looking for, and bins or folders are just too crude to properly handle larger tasks. </p>&#13;
			<p>But applying Keywords is only part of the story. How do you use them to quickly find the shots you need?</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-132"><a id="_idTextAnchor136"/>Searching with Keywords</h1>&#13;
			<p>Time to reap the harvest: here, you will use the <a id="_idIndexMarker321"/>Keywords you've applied to find clips easily. You'll also discover how to take this further. But first: the simple, important, magic part.</p>&#13;
			<p>As you've seen, when you apply a Keyword (such as <strong class="source-inline">gondolas</strong>) to a clip, you're also adding it to a matching <strong class="bold">Keyword Collection</strong>, gathering all the clips that share the same Keyword without actually moving those clips to a separate location.</p>&#13;
			<p>You can see the clip in the Keyword Collection, but you can also see it in the Event where it was imported, and in the Keyword Collections for any other Keywords you've added to the same clips. There's no downside here; the clip is effectively in all these places at once. Magic!</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer147" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_4.38_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 4.38: The &quot;gondolas&quot; Keyword Collection has anything with a gondola, and many of these clips have other Keywords applied too"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.38: The "gondolas" Keyword Collection has anything with a gondola, and many of these clips have other Keywords a<span>pplied too</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Keyword Collections collect related clips just as well as folders or bins can, with the bonus that the same clip can appear in multiple Keyword Collections — a clip could have <strong class="source-inline">water</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">gondolas</strong> applied, for example. This means you can find clips <em class="italic">far more easily</em> during the editing process. Applying multiple Keywords to a single clip makes it easier to find, unlike bins or folders, which lock<a id="_idIndexMarker322"/> a clip away in a single place and can make it harder to find.</p>&#13;
			<p>Even better, it's easy to combine the contents of multiple Keyword Collections:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Click on one Keyword Collection to select it, and you'll see the clips with that Keyword to <span>the right.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">⌘-click</strong> on a second Keyword Collection to also show clips with tha<span>t Keyword.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>This makes it easy to broaden your search, so you could find <strong class="source-inline">rooftops</strong> <strong class="bold">OR</strong> <strong class="source-inline">canals</strong>. But what if you want shots with <strong class="source-inline">rooftops</strong> <strong class="bold">AND</strong> <strong class="source-inline">canals</strong>? That's pretty easy too, but requires a different approach:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Click on the magnifying glass icon in the top-right corner of the Browser to drop down a sea<span>rch field.</span><p>You could type in this field to locate clips with a phrase in their name, in the <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> field, in their Keywords, and more, but we won't. Instead, we'll take the following steps.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Click on the small window icon to the right of the new sea<span>rch field.</span><p>This causes the <strong class="bold">Filter</strong> window to appear, and it's very powerful:</p><div id="_idContainer148" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_4.39_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 4.39: Filtering starts with text, but can do much more"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.39: Filtering starts with text, but can do<span> much more</span></p><p>You can search for text in the field at the top of this window, or add additional criteria, which is what we will do.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>In the top-right corner of the <strong class="bold">Filter</strong> window, press the <strong class="bold">Plus</strong> button, and choose<span> </span><span><strong class="bold">Keywords</strong></span><span>:</span><div id="_idContainer149" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_4.40_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 4.40: Filtering by Keywords allows more complex searches"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.40: Filtering by Keywords allows more comple<span>x searches</span></p><p>It's possible to filter by<a id="_idIndexMarker323"/> many different metadata items, but Keywords suit us here. </p></li>&#13;
				<li>Using the controls within the <strong class="bold">Keywords</strong> area, uncheck all the Keywords, then check only two of your Keywords, <span>like this:</span><div id="_idContainer150" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_4.41_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 4.41: Check two of your Keywords at once"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.41: Check two of your Keywor<span>ds at once</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Change <strong class="bold">Include Any</strong> to <strong class="bold">Include All</strong> to change<a id="_idIndexMarker324"/> the <strong class="source-inline">or</strong> operation to an <strong class="source-inline">and</strong> operation, <span>like this:</span><div id="_idContainer151" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_4.42_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 4.42: Include All rather than Include Any"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.42: Include All rather than I<span>nclude Any</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Now, only clips with both those Keywords will appear in the view b<span>eneath it:</span><div id="_idContainer152" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_4.43_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 4.43: Include All means that only clips with both Keywords applied will be shown"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.43: Include All means that only clips with both Keywords applied wil<span>l be shown</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Finally, click on the <strong class="bold">New Smart Collection</strong> button at the bottom of the <strong class="bold">Filt</strong><span><strong class="bold">er</strong></span><span> window.</span><p>A <strong class="bold">Smart Collection</strong> is <a id="_idIndexMarker325"/>like a saved search — it always displays clips that satisfy the specified criteria.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>If the Smart Collection's name is selected and ready for editing, type a name and press <strong class="bold">return</strong>. (If you've clicked elsewhere and the selection has been lost, first select it with a single click and press <strong class="bold">return</strong> to start ren<span>aming it.)</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>The new Smart Collection will appear with Keyword Collections within your Event, and can be selected at any time to view its clips. You can't drag clips directly into a Smart Collection, though you can add Keywords or notes to make that clip match its search criteria. You can also double-click a Smart Collection to edit those criteria.</p>&#13;
			<p>Very helpfully, each Library comes with a preset group of Smart Collections that collect all video files, audio files, Favorites (<a href="B15343_05_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor141"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Choose Your Favorites: Selecting, Rating, and Searching</em>), projects (<a href="B15343_06_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor164"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Build the Spine of the Story: Quick Assembly</em>), and still images. You can drag your own Smart Collections into this top-level folder if you want to search across<a id="_idIndexMarker326"/> multiple Events at the same time.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-133"><a id="_idTextAnchor137"/>Review — searching with Keywords</h2>&#13;
			<p>Now, all that work creating and applying Keywords is worthwhile. You know how to show clips within a single Keyword Collection, and also how to search in more advanced ways for clips that satisfy multiple Keywords. Persistent Smart Collections allow you to keep a search active; Keywords go way beyond what simple bins or folders can do, and we've only scratched the surface. In the next chapter, we'll get into selecting parts of clips, but first, let's wrap things up.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-134"><a id="_idTextAnchor138"/>Summary</h1>&#13;
			<p>This chapter covered several important features. By now, you should know all kinds of shortcuts for moving around your footage instantly, know how to deal with the Viewer, how to manipulate the Browser, understand what metadata is and how to find it, and all about how to plan for, apply, and search with Keywords. If you've been working along with your own footage, and especially if you've never worked this way before, I hope you're seeing the power of Keywords for yourself. You might want to jump straight into a timeline now!</p>&#13;
			<p>But don't start editing just yet. There's one more thing you should do first, and it's just as useful as keywording. In the next chapter, we're going to mark the best parts of our best clips as our Favorites. It's going to be great.</p>&#13;
