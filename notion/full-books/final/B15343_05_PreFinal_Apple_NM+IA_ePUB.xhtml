			<p>Organizing your clips with Keywords is an important first step, but it's not the whole story. Keywords tell you roughly what each clip contains, or what it can be used for, but just as important is knowing which parts of a clip are best. Soon after you apply Keywords to entire clips, you should select the best parts and then mark them for later retrieval. Final Cut Pro X makes all that easy, allowing you to define a range with an In and Out point, then apply Favorites and/or Keywords to just that clip segment. Within a short time, you'll have not only an organized view of all your clips but also an organized view of the best parts of your clips. Get this right, and the editing process becomes much easier. </p>&#13;

			</ul>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-138"><a id="_idTextAnchor142"/>Selecting part of a clip</h1>&#13;
			<p>To date, we've <a id="_idIndexMarker327"/>been <a id="_idIndexMarker328"/>working with entire clips — whatever the camera recorded — but editing is about selecting just the best parts. The Browser is a great place to do that because your choices will be automatically recorded. First, we'll select ranges on clips, and next, we'll rate.</p>&#13;
			<p>The selection process has a few subtleties, so make sure you're working with clips that haven't been partly selected already, and follow these steps carefully:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li>Switch to <strong class="bold">Filmstrip</strong> view, not List view. (While these steps can mostly be performed in List view too, we'll use Filmstrip v<span>iew here.)</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Click on the background, which is the space betw<span>een clips.</span><p>This will deselect any clips that have been fully selected, which makes the next step simpler. To select part of a clip, it's now easy to click and drag.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Click on a blank, unselected area inside a clip, then drag forward to another point in that same clip, an<span>d release.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>This <a id="_idIndexMarker329"/>marks an <strong class="bold">In point</strong> where you clicked and an <strong class="bold">Out point</strong> where you released, marking this part of the clip <a id="_idIndexMarker330"/>as your selection. It's also possible to drag backward to the left, in which case you'll be dragging from the Out and releasing on the In point:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer154" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_5.1_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 5.1: The start and end of this clip aren't what I wanted, but a chunk of the middle is"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.1: The start and end of this clip aren't what I wanted, but a chunk of the<span> middle is</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Once you've marked an In and Out point on a clip, it will be remembered until a new In and Out point is marked on that same clip. This is the case even if you click on the background between clips. However, you can change the selection:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Starting from a point outside the current selection, drag a new selection from <span>In to Out.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>The current selection can also be adjusted with the mouse:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Drag on the edges of the current selection to move the In or O<span>ut points:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer155" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_5.2_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 5.2: Dragging the edges of an existing selection is obvious and works, but is slow"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.2: Dragging the edges of an existing selection is obvious and works, b<span>ut is slow</span></p>&#13;
			<p>But it's much <a id="_idIndexMarker331"/>easier to position (or reposition) a selection with two easily remembered shortcut <a id="_idIndexMarker332"/>keys. Place the playhead, skim over a clip, or simply start playback, then do the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">I</strong> to set an <strong class="bold">In point</strong> at the current skimmer or playhead<span> position.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">O</strong> to set an <strong class="bold">Out point</strong> at the current skimmer or playhead<span> position.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>The <strong class="bold">I</strong> and <strong class="bold">O</strong> shortcuts are much faster than trying to pick up the edge of a selection and dragging it to the right spot, and they let you use any method (keyboard or mouse trackpad) to move through a clip. The original In and Out points are simply replaced if you tap <strong class="bold">I</strong> or <strong class="bold">O</strong> again, and you can change your mind repeatedly. You can even tap <strong class="bold">I</strong> or <strong class="bold">O</strong> while the video is playing, and combined with <strong class="bold">JKL</strong>'s multi-speed playback, you'll be able to mark exactly the right part of a clip very quickly, and we'll practice this soon.</p>&#13;
			<p>Here's an illustrated sequence of how you might mark up a clip with a false start:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Starting with selection on a clip, press <strong class="bold">Space</strong> to start<span> playback:</span><div id="_idContainer156" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_5.3_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 5.3: Playback has started, so watch the Viewer"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.3: Playback has started, so watch <span>the Viewer</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>After a <a id="_idIndexMarker333"/>few seconds, tap <strong class="bold">I</strong> to<a id="_idIndexMarker334"/> set a new<span> In point:</span><div id="_idContainer157" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_5.4_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 5.4: Tap I to set a new In point; keep it playing"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.4: Tap I to set a new In point; keep <span>it playing</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>After a few more seconds, tap <strong class="bold">I</strong> again, clearing the last In point and setting <span>a new one:</span><div id="_idContainer158" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_5.5_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 5.5: Tap I again to set another new In point; keep it playing"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.5: Tap I again to set another new In point; keep <span>it playing</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Finally, let the clip play for several more seconds, then tap <strong class="bold">O</strong> to set an <span>Out point:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer159" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_5.6_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 5.6: Tap O to set the Out point and you're done"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.6: Tap O to set the Out point and y<span>ou're done</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Sometimes, you'll <a id="_idIndexMarker335"/>want to clear the current selection entirely, or clear selections on several <a id="_idIndexMarker336"/>clips at once. If selection ranges have already been created on one or more clips and you want to start over, do the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">⌥X</strong> to remove a selection from all the selec<span>ted clips.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>While tapping <strong class="bold">I</strong> or <strong class="bold">O</strong> is usually quickest, if you want to able to drag and release to make a new selection, always press <strong class="bold">⌥X</strong> to clear the old selection first. If you don't, you'll often end up dragging the old selection instead. This is a more common issue in List view, because clicking to select a full clip there is more persistent.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">It is possible to create multiple In and Out points on a single clip, but the next section of the chapter makes this largely unnecessary. Still, if you need to select an additional range on a single clip, hold <strong class="bold">⌘</strong> while you drag on its thumbnail.</p>&#13;
			<p>Let's finish with a quick word about the persistence of selections. As you've no doubt found already, clicking on a clip selects it all, showing a yellow outline. Essentially, you've marked an In point at the start, and an Out point at the end. Selecting a whole clip like this is helpful if you want to add a Keyword to an entire clip, or if you want to use an entire clip in an edit, but clicking next to the clip's filmstrip in List view doesn't remove that selection.</p>&#13;
			<p>That said, if you've selected part of a clip, clicking next to that clip doesn't remove it <em class="italic">in either Filmstrip or List view</em>. Dragging the edges of an existing selection is slow and painful, so use <strong class="bold">⌥X</strong>, <strong class="bold">I</strong>, or <strong class="bold">O</strong> to select what you really want, and train yourself out of needlessly clicking, especially in List view.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-139"><a id="_idTextAnchor143"/>Review – selecting part of a clip</h2>&#13;
			<p>You've learned how<a id="_idIndexMarker337"/> to select<a id="_idIndexMarker338"/> with click-and-drag, and how to do it with the keyboard too — <strong class="bold">I</strong> and <strong class="bold">O</strong> are great for revising selected ranges or creating them in the first place. Remember too that if you need to start again, clear those ranges out with <strong class="bold">⌥X</strong>, and avoid needless clicking because it just creates work for yourself.</p>&#13;
			<p>But we're only halfway there. While it's true that a selection is persistent, it's still pretty fragile, and could be lost with a single keypress. How to make them more permanent? The solution is <strong class="bold">Favorites</strong>.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-140"><a id="_idTextAnchor144"/>Rating as a Favorite</h1>&#13;
			<p>Here, I'll show you not only how to <a id="_idIndexMarker339"/>rate parts of clips as "good," but also give you a few workflow tips that you can apply to your own content. Seeing this part of the process in action is one of the magic "wow" moments you'll encounter as you learn FCP X, so don't skip it. This is simple stuff, but powerful.</p>&#13;
			<p>A selection is temporary, so if you've selected the "good" part of a clip, you should then mark it as a Favorite so that your choice will be remembered and be easier to find later. This is done with just one key:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">F</strong> to mark the selection as a<span> </span><span><strong class="bold">Favorite</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>On the thumbnail, a Favorite is shown as a green line, above the blue Keyword line. If you want to mark another part of the same clip as a Favorite, that's fine — just repeat the same steps as before:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Press <strong class="bold">I</strong> to set an <strong class="bold">In point</strong> at the current skimmer or playhead<span> position.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">O</strong> to set an <strong class="bold">Out point</strong> at the current skimmer or playhead<span> position.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">F</strong> to mark the selection as a<span> </span><span><strong class="bold">Favorite</strong></span><span>:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer160" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_5.7_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 5.7: Marking your selection as a Favorite is a great way to remember it"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.7: Marking your selection as a Favorite is a great way to r<span>emember it</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Ideally, you'll have a selection active when you press <strong class="bold">F</strong>. But if no selection is active, the entire current clip will be marked as a Favorite — sometimes useful, often not. Usually, the quickest thing to do is undo (<strong class="bold">⌘Z</strong>), but you can also remove a Favorite by unrating it:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">U</strong> to <strong class="bold">remove Favorites</strong> from the <span>selection.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Now, it's just a matter of marking <a id="_idIndexMarker340"/>everything you like as a Favorite. If you're working with a longer clip, such as an interview or longer B-roll, you'll want to scan it for potentially useful content. It'll go something like this:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Hover near the start of a clip, then press the <strong class="bold">spacebar</strong> to start<span> playback.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>If nothing interesting is happening, press <strong class="bold">L</strong> once or twice (to speed up) until something potentially interesti<span>ng starts.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">J</strong> to skim back to where the potentially interesting thing begins, then press <strong class="bold">L</strong> to play forward, and <strong class="bold">I</strong> to mark an<span> In point.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Watch and listen to the video as it p<span>lays back.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>If this section ends up being good, press <strong class="bold">O</strong> at the end, and then <strong class="bold">F</strong> to mark it as a<span> Favorite.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>If it's no good, don't mark a Favorite; just play forward, at high speed if <span>necessary.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Repeat this process, pressing <strong class="bold">I</strong> to set a new In point when the next potentially interesting thing starts, then <strong class="bold">O</strong> and <strong class="bold">F</strong> at the end of that interest<span>ing thing.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>At the end of one clip, press <strong class="bold">↓</strong> to move to the next clip. This will happen automatically if you use the Continuous Playba<span>ck option.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>There are several ways to mark Favorites, and many can work well. In general, I prefer to use the keyboard more heavily for interviews, with one hand for <strong class="bold">J</strong>, <strong class="bold">K</strong>, <strong class="bold">L</strong>, <strong class="bold">I</strong>, and <strong class="bold">O</strong>, and another on <strong class="bold">F</strong>. I'll use lots of quick <strong class="bold">JKL</strong> movement to get to the right In point before pressing <strong class="bold">I</strong>, and then watch like a hawk before pressing <strong class="bold">O</strong> at the Out point. With experience, you'll be able to anticipate the In and Out points by visually scanning the audio waveform to see where sentences start and end. There's no need to pause playback; just tap <strong class="bold">I</strong> and <strong class="bold">O</strong> as the<a id="_idIndexMarker341"/> video plays, and <strong class="bold">F</strong> before you reset the selection with the next press of <strong class="bold">I</strong>:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.8: Most of the critical keys on a custom editin<span>g keyboard</span></p>&#13;
			<p>For scanning visual B-roll, I usually prefer to use the mouse. With my right hand, I skim over the footage at high speed, clicking and dragging to select, while my left hand rests on <strong class="bold">F</strong> to mark as I go. Of course, using the Browser's Filmstrip view serves as a solid preview of a clip's content, so you'll have a good idea of where the In and Out points should go before you start. If you're working with your own Library, go ahead and mark several parts of several clips as Favorites now.</p>&#13;
			<p>You can take your time with this process, or be less careful. While carefully marked Favorites will need less tweaking down the line, they'll take more time to create upfront. In general, I like to take my time with interviews, and I'm pretty loose with my B-roll edits. How long you spend on choosing your Favorites will depend on the edit, but do use them. You don't have to get your selections perfect, but the more work you do now, the less you'll have to do<a id="_idIndexMarker342"/> later:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer162" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_5.9_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 5.9: Some clips will have one Favorite, some will have more, and some will have none"/>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.9: Some clips will have one Favorite, some will have more, and some will<span> have none</span></p>&#13;
			<p>OK, so you've made some green lines — so far, so good. But I promised you a "wow" moment, and here it is.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-141"><a id="_idTextAnchor145"/>Showing only the Favorites</h2>&#13;
			<p>Your clips will now be covered in green Favorite lines, and the last selection made on each clip will still be selected in yellow. To reset the selection to one of the Favorites on a clip, you can click on its green line, which can be helpful. But it's not the best trick here. Instead, look at the top of the Browser for that <strong class="bold">Clip Filtering</strong> menu we used earlier, probably showing <strong class="bold">All Clips</strong>:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">Favorites</strong> from this menu, or<span> press </span><span><strong class="bold">⌃F</strong></span><span>:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure">Figure 5.10: The Clip Filtering menu</p>&#13;
			<p>Now, you're only looking at<a id="_idIndexMarker343"/> your Favorites, and everything else is hidden. Take a quick moment to let that sink in.</p>&#13;
			<p>This is hugely helpful because you can just ignore everything you don't care about. If you've marked two parts of a single clip, then you'll see two separate clips with the same name. Keywords still work too: if you choose a <strong class="bold">Keyword Collection</strong> while <strong class="bold">Favorites</strong> is active in the <strong class="bold">Clip Filtering</strong> menu, then you'll see the best clips in that category. The same is also true in <strong class="bold">Smart Co</strong><strong class="bold">llections</strong>:</p>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.11: Viewing Favorites: only the best parts of the best cl<span>ips remain</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The less-good parts of your clips are still there if you need them — just choose <strong class="bold">All Clips</strong> from the <strong class="bold">Clip Filtering</strong> menu. It's<a id="_idIndexMarker344"/> very possible to envision your entire edit from the clips you're looking at now; all you need to do is put them in the right order. If you don't choose the right clips the first time around, you'll have easy access to a collection of the best alternatives.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-142"><a id="_idTextAnchor146"/>Review — rating as a Favorite</h2>&#13;
			<p>You've learned that <a id="_idIndexMarker345"/>Favorites are a great way to remember the best parts of your clips. <strong class="bold">I</strong>, <strong class="bold">O</strong>, and <strong class="bold">F</strong> are three keys you'll press a lot when you're rating the best parts of your clips, and after you add your Favorites, be sure to limit your view to <strong class="bold">Favorites</strong> only so that that's all you see.</p>&#13;
			<p>If <strong class="bold">Keywords</strong> make a pile of books into an ordered bookshelf, <strong class="bold">Favorites</strong> are a collection of bookmarks drawing your attention to the best pages in every book. The <strong class="bold">Favorites view</strong> is like a corkboard at the front of a bookshop with a copy of all the best pages from all of those books in one place — except that everything is non-destructive, and you can change your view at any time.</p>&#13;
			<p>While I use Favorites on almost every job I do, I don't use them on every clip. If I know that a particular segment will definitely be used, I'll simply select part of it and then immediately add it to a timeline. Favorites are used to make your decisions easier, and if a clip is important, there's no choice to be made. But, as B-roll is often changed, even if I plan to add a selected B-roll straight to a timeline, I'll press <strong class="bold">F</strong> first to record that clip in case I change my mind.</p>&#13;
			<p>As awesome as they are, Favorites <a id="_idIndexMarker346"/>aren't enough for every workflow. Final Cut Pro X also offers other ways to mark parts of your video, which can be useful. These ways include Rejecting, using Keywords on ranges, Markers, and notes.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-143"><a id="_idTextAnchor147"/>Rating as Rejected</h1>&#13;
			<p>So far, there are two levels of "good" — the Favorite parts and the rest. But how about the "bad" parts? If you'd like to <a id="_idIndexMarker347"/>approach your rating process from the other end, you'll want to get into Rejecting, and that's what you'll learn here.</p>&#13;
			<p>Marking part of a clip as Rejected is the opposite of marking part of a clip as a Favorite: you're saying that the selection is bad or unusable. The workflow is very similar, too:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">With the keyboard or mouse, mark <strong class="bold">In</strong> and <strong class="bold">Out</strong> points <span>on a clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press the <strong class="bold">delete</strong> key (not forward delete) to mark that selection as<span> </span><span><strong class="bold">Rejected</strong></span><span>:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer165" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_5.12_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 5.12: The camera was shaky at the start of this clip, so I Rejected that section"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.12: The camera was shaky at the start of this clip, so I Rejected th<span>at section</span></p>&#13;
			<p>If your current Browser view is showing <strong class="bold">All Clips</strong>, then you'll see a red line appear on that part of the clip. A range cannot be both a Favorite and Rejected at the same time: it's one or the other, or not rated at all. Just like with Favorites, a selected area can be unrated with <strong class="bold">U</strong>.</p>&#13;
			<p>There's another choice from the <strong class="bold">Clip Filtering</strong> menu that can be useful here: <strong class="bold">Hide Rejected</strong>. In this mode, you won't see red lines because those parts will be hidden entirely, and clips with Rejected sections in the middle will be split into two or more separate segments.</p>&#13;
			<p>Marking clip segments as <a id="_idIndexMarker348"/>Rejected can be used in addition to Favorites, or instead of them if you prefer. Some editors like to Reject the clapperboard at the start and end of a clip because once that information has been used, you don't need to see it anymore. Another use is to Reject brief moments between answers in long interview clips to make each answer into an independent clip.</p>&#13;
			<p>Personally, I don't Reject very much because I prefer to use Favorites more heavily. But if you'd prefer not to limit your view to Favorites only, consider Rejecting and using <strong class="bold">Hide Rejected</strong> as a happy middle ground:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer166" class="figure">&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;

			<p>One last note on really bad footage. If you encounter a clip that's entirely 100% useless — from an accidental press of the record button, for example — don't just Reject the entire clip. Instead, trash it by pressing <strong class="bold">⌘delete</strong>, and the clip will be thrown away entirely. Hard drive space might be cheap, but there's no need to waste it:</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.14: This warning is the final step before a clip is deleted from a Library (and likely,<span> the disk)</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Time for a recap.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-144"><a id="_idTextAnchor148"/>Review — rating as Rejected</h2>&#13;
			<p>That was <a id="_idIndexMarker349"/>fairly straightforward — if you don't like something, press <strong class="bold">delete</strong>, and it'll be hidden without actually being destroyed. Also, Rejecting a small part of a long clip is a nice way to break it up without picking any Favorites. Still, if a clip is totally useless, you can absolutely throw it away if you want to.</p>&#13;
			<p>Now that you know how to rate a clip as Rejected, let's dive into the next section, where we will see different methods by which you can add notes to a clip.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-145"><a id="_idTextAnchor149"/>Storing additional information</h1>&#13;
			<p>Marking a <a id="_idIndexMarker350"/>clip segment as good or bad is powerful, but what if you want to include more substantial notes about a clip? There are several ways to do this, and while it's optional, on larger productions it's a great idea. Selective Keywords? Sure. Changing clip names or adding notes? Absolutely. Adding <strong class="bold">Markers</strong> to note moments in &#13;
time? Done.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-146"><a id="_idTextAnchor150"/>Selective Keywords</h2>&#13;
			<p>One method is to add <a id="_idIndexMarker351"/>Keywords to specific parts of clips, rather <a id="_idIndexMarker352"/>than on entire clips. Keywords can have quite long names, and different Keywords can overlap. The process is predictable:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">With the keyboard or mouse, mark <strong class="bold">In</strong> and <strong class="bold">Out</strong> points <span>on a clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Use the <strong class="bold">Keywords</strong> window to apply <span>a Keyword.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>While this can be a handy workflow for longer, more complex clips, I usually find it's not necessary for shorter ones. Personally, I prefer to use Keywords on entire clips, and in combination with a more targeted Favorite, it's often all you need.</p>&#13;
			<p>Adding Keywords to ranges is an option if you want another level of more targeted organization, and is more likely to be used if your operators tend to prefer longer continuous shots, potentially with several takes in a single clip. Selective Keywords are also useful when collecting related thoughts from several different clips, such as a series of interviews with different people on similar topics. You can apply Favorites as usual, but then also add a Keyword to a specific range to make a note of the subject being discussed. When all the interviews have been processed, the related sections of each interview will be gathered together in a series of Keyword Collections.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-147"><a id="_idTextAnchor151"/>Notes</h2>&#13;
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> field, found in the <strong class="bold">List</strong> view in the Browser and in the <strong class="bold">Info</strong> tab of the Inspector, can contain text <a id="_idIndexMarker353"/>of arbitrary length. These notes can be added to an individual clip, or even to a Favorite within a clip, and could contain notes for VFX artists, instructions from the director, or anything else. To add a note to a single clip, do the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Click to the left of the <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> column on a clip or a Favorite, and then type <span>your note:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer168" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_5.15_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 5.15: You can leave as much text in the Notes field as you wish"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.15: You can leave as much text in the Notes field a<span>s you wish</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Alternatively, for one or more clips, do the following:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Select one or more clips in th<span>e Browser.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Open the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> and switch to the<span> </span><span><strong class="bold">Info</strong></span><span> tab.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Switch to the <strong class="bold">Basic</strong>, <strong class="bold">General</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Extended</strong> metadata view using the menu in the bottom-le<span>ft corner.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Type a note into the <strong class="bold">No</strong><span><strong class="bold">tes</strong></span><span> field:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer169" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_5.16_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 5.16: The Inspector might be an easier place to add Notes to entire clips, but not to a range"/>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.16: The Inspector might be an easier place to add Notes to entire clips, but not <span>to a range</span></p>&#13;
			<p>A limitation <a id="_idIndexMarker354"/>is that the Inspector can only add a note to an entire clip, not to a Favorite part of a clip. Notes aren't the only way to add general-purpose text, but they are a convenient one.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-148"><a id="_idTextAnchor152"/>Names</h2>&#13;
			<p>Clip names can also <a id="_idIndexMarker355"/>hold information. While I generally recommend using the original media name as the clip name, some editors prefer to rename clips to include general text. Probably a better approach is to rename a Favorite range. Currently, each Favorite is just called <strong class="bold">Favorite</strong>, but it can be renamed: click once on the word <strong class="bold">Favorite</strong>, then press <strong class="bold">return</strong>, type a new name, and press <strong class="bold">return</strong> again to finish. If you've created multiple Favorites on the same clip, changing their names like this will help you to differentiate between them:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer170" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_5.17_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 5.17: Two parts of this clip have been marked as a Favorite (the stars) but renamed, making them searchable"/>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.17: Two parts of this clip have been marked as a Favorite (the stars) but renamed, making them <span>searchable</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Now, let's move to the last method — <strong class="bold">Markers</strong> — which allow us to make a potentially lengthy note in a specific spot, not across a range.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-149"><a id="_idTextAnchor153"/>Markers</h2>&#13;
			<p>The most specific way to add notes is to add a Marker. A Marker<a id="_idIndexMarker356"/> is attached to a particular frame, rather than a range, but its name can be long and informative. It's also possible to create different types of Markers for different functions. To create a Marker, do the following:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Skim to or click on a frame with<span>in a clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">⌥M</strong> to create a Marker and edit<span> its name.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Type a name for the n<span>ew Marker:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer171" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_5.18_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 5.18: Naming a Marker"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.18: Namin<span>g a Marker</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Pressing <strong class="bold">M</strong> alone is sufficient if you don't want to name a Marker. You could also press <strong class="bold">M twice</strong> to create it and then edit it, if you are careful not to move the mouse between the two keypresses. Any of these approaches make a generic Marker, and while there are two other kinds of Markers, they will be explored in <a href="B15343_10_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor271"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">Explore a Little: Compound Clips and Timeli</em><em class="italic">ne Tricks</em>.</p>&#13;
			<p>Why make a Marker? One good reason is that a Marker is easy to see in any Browser view, while Notes and Favorite names are only visible in the List view when a clip's disclosure triangle is open:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer172" class="figure">&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.19: The List view lets you see all the Marker names a<span>t a glance</span></p>&#13;
			<p>A <a id="_idIndexMarker357"/>Marker can be clicked on to show its name in the Skimmer Info (toggle with <strong class="bold">⌃Y</strong> if you don't see it) above your cursor, and if <strong class="bold">Snapping</strong> is active, then you'll hit Markers easily while you skim. <strong class="bold">Snapping</strong> is a feature that will be used more during the editing process, but you can press <strong class="bold">N</strong> to toggle it on or off at any time:</p>&#13;

			<p>There's no fixed workflow regarding Markers, names, or notes, so experiment to discover what works best for you.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-150"><a id="_idTextAnchor154"/>Review — storing additional information</h2>&#13;
			<p>You've learned plenty of great ways to work here, and applying Keywords to sections of clips is a useful way to step beyond even what a full-clip Keyword and a Favorite can do. If that's not what you need, you can rename a clip, rename a Favorite, add a Marker, or add some Notes. By adding text of any kind, you're making your clips easier to find, and that's going to help you when you use the search feature. As you might expect by now, it's simple at a glance, but complex if you look deeper — let's take that deeper look now.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-151"><a id="_idTextAnchor155"/>Advanced searches</h1>&#13;
			<p>In a moderately sized pr<a id="_idTextAnchor156"/>oject, you <a id="_idIndexMarker358"/>can click on a Keyword Collection to get you started, look at the Favorites, then visually scan to find the clip you remember. But on a big project, text organization is the only way to stay sane, and in this part of the book, I'll show you how to dig into searching and filtering.</p>&#13;
			<p>In <a href="B15343_04_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor113"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Sort it Out: Reviewing and Keywording</em>, I showed you how to use the <strong class="bold">Filter</strong> window, accessible through the magnifying glass icon at the top right of the Browser. Now that you know how to add text to your clips, the Filter window will be even more useful. To start, do the following:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Click on the magnifying glass icon in the top-right corner of the Browser to drop down a sea<span>rch field.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Into the search field, type a word that appears in the name of any clip or any notes field, or a name that you've given to a Favorite range or a<span>ny Marker:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption"> </p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer174" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_5.21_B15343.jpg" alt="Figure 5.21: The word &quot;awesome&quot; can be found in Notes, clip names, Favorite names, and Markers"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.21: The word "awesome" can be found in Notes, clip names, Favorite names, a<span>nd Markers</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Within the current<a id="_idIndexMarker359"/> view, which could be a <strong class="bold">Keyword Collection</strong> or <strong class="bold">Smart Collection</strong>, you'll now only see clips that use that word somewhere. It doesn't matter which field the word is stored in:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Click on the small window icon to the right of the new sea<span>rch field.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Filter</strong> window will now appear, and the text field will be prepopulated with the word you chose. Just before the name, there's a menu allowing you to exclude clips with the chosen word (<strong class="bold">Does Not Include</strong>). You can further limit your search by including <strong class="bold">Favorite</strong> or <strong class="bold">Rejected</strong>:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>In the top-right corner of the <strong class="bold">Filter</strong> window, press the plus button, and choos<span>e </span><span><strong class="bold">Ratings</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>You can now choose to show only Favorites or only Rejected clips. Because of <strong class="bold">All</strong> at the top left, the Rating combines with the text you searched for to constrain the results and show fewer clips. While that's probably what you want, if you want to see clips that satisfy <em class="italic">either Text or Rating, but not both</em>, you could choose <strong class="bold">Any</strong> instead of <strong class="bold">All</strong>. Then, you'll see clips that satisfy <em class="italic">at least one </em>of the criteria.</p>&#13;
			<p>That would be good if you wanted to broaden your selection, but we want to narrow it down even further, so leave the top-left menu set to All, and then:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Press the plus button, add <strong class="bold">People</strong> to the search, and choose one <span>shot type.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Here, I'm viewing clips with <strong class="bold">awesome</strong> as text that are Favorites and that are of one person only:</p>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.22: Getting more specific with text, ratings, and analysi<span>s Keywords</span></p>&#13;
			<p>As before, you can save a <strong class="bold">Smart Collection</strong> to preserve this search for later viewing. If you continue to add Keywords, text, and ratings, then you might see more items inside this <strong class="bold">Smart Collection</strong> in the future.</p>&#13;
			<p>Including those already<a id="_idIndexMarker360"/> discussed, you can filter by the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;

			<p>Obviously, that's a pretty<a id="_idIndexMarker361"/> comprehensive list, and you might never need all the power it offers. But if you're working on a larger project, and the director asks to see the best alternative takes of a specific line of dialogue, an open <strong class="bold">Smart Collection</strong> is a great way to find a shot. Tag your clips well if you want to make the best use of this.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-152"><a id="_idTextAnchor157"/>Review — advanced searches</h2>&#13;
			<p>You now know that the <strong class="bold">Filter</strong> window can be used for a lot more than you'd first think. Larger productions can really take advantage of this, tagging all kinds of information and then finding exactly the right shot by searching for it. While Keywords on entire clips and selected ranges are probably the easiest tools to use, <strong class="bold">Smart Collections</strong> based on advanced searches can<a id="_idIndexMarker362"/> expose whatever you need. If you're working on a larger production, plan carefully to use this feature to its full potential.</p>&#13;
			<p>Time for a look back at this chapter.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-153"><a id="_idTextAnchor158"/>Summary</h1>&#13;
			<p>While Keywords let you know roughly what you shot, you now know that Favorites let you focus in on the very best of what you shot. As you continue through the rest of the editing process, you'll love being able to instantly locate the best shot for any situation simply by viewing only Favorites. A huge chunk of your job is done, you don't need to repeatedly and manually search through all your clips, and you don't need to build "stringouts" either. The traditional workflow of making throwaway timelines to gather "good" clips simply can't compete with the efficiency of Keywords combined with Favorites.</p>&#13;
			<p>For larger productions, you can see that changing clip names and adding notes, Markers, and range-based "selective" Keywords will help you (or your editorial team) to add less obvious and more subtle information to clips. With the added metadata you now know how to add, along with searching, filtering, and Smart Collections will allow you to discover the right clips when you can't just see them at a glance.</p>&#13;
			<p>Try the Favorite approach out on a few different kinds of jobs, try Rejecting, then adding text and Markers on a few more, and you'll discover that different approaches work in different situations. If you need to get a video out in no time flat, you'll probably spend a little time on keywording and then not much at all on Favorites because you'll be editing by instinct — each clip you throw onto a Timeline has to be the right one. But longer projects will benefit from all kinds of information being added: scenes, shots, takes, multiple Favorites, Notes to help you find things, Markers to remind you of further processing, and more. Spend the time early on to save time down the track.</p>&#13;
			<p>Next, though, it's time to make a new Project, and throw some media into it. Everything so far has been about preparing for the edit, and now it's time to jump in. <a id="_idTextAnchor159"/>Here we go! </p>&#13;
