			<p>With the color of your sequence under control, you'll want to take a look at some of the other visual changes that you can apply to your clips. That includes different ways to resize clips, remove shakiness through stabilization, and much more through the wide world of video effects. There's no need for effects to be static; you'll also learn how to animate effects, transforms, and even color corrections over time, and how to use color and shape masks to limit them. It's another big one, but in bullet form, this chapter covers:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Adjusting video <span>properties</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Animating with<span> keyframes</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Applying and using vid<span>eo effects</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>It's entirely possible to finish your edit and fix color before applying any effects, but don't feel constrained. If you prefer to add effects or transforms while you're still trimming and adding cutaways, that's OK and up to you. Certainly, some of the basic transform operations are simple enough to handle on-the-fly during an edit, and that's where we'll start.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-319"><a id="_idTextAnchor332"/>Adjusting video properties</h1>&#13;
			<p>In this <a id="_idIndexMarker885"/>section, you'll find out how to control how a clip is presented, by adjusting its blend mode, position, scale, cropping, and corner positions. You'll discover various ways to change these video properties in the Video tab of the Inspector, and in the Viewer directly. Video properties will allow you to zoom in or crop to a particular part of the frame, to shrink a clip down for a picture-in-picture effect, or to let one clip visually interact with the clips below it:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.1: The Video tab in the Inspector has ma<span>ny options</span></p>&#13;
			<p>There are many reasons to tweak how a clip looks in this way, and you'll find these controls straightforward.</p>&#13;
			<p>After the  previous<a id="_idIndexMarker886"/> chapter, <a href="B15343_11_PreFinal_Apple_SK+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor296"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, <em class="italic">Play with Light: Color Correction and Grading</em>, you're probably used to <strong class="bold">⌥-clicking</strong>, and the same rules apply here:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>To make sure you're viewing the clip you're editing, <strong class="bold">always ⌥-click the c</strong><span><strong class="bold">lip first</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>The other golden rule here is:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Always adjust values in the Inspector by <em class="italic">dragging on th</em><span><em class="italic">e numbers</em></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>While most of the properties here have sliders (or other controls) next to the numbers, sliders have a fixed range, and the numbers can often go beyond those ranges. Here's how you can use these numbers:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Click and drag (left and right, or up and down) directly on the numbers to ch<span>ange them.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>While dragging, hold <strong class="bold">⇧</strong> to change values more quickly, for large ad<span>justments.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>While dragging, hold <strong class="bold">⌥</strong> to change values more slowly, for fine<span>r control.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>If you simply click rather than dragging, you can:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Type a new value directly, pressing <strong class="bold">return</strong> to finalize y<span>our input.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Adjust the existing value with the <strong class="bold">↑</strong> a<span>nd </span><span><strong class="bold">↓</strong></span><span> keys.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>The three most<a id="_idIndexMarker887"/> important sections here also have on-screen controls, which are often (but not always) helpful. Here, we'll work from top to bottom, so make sure you have a timeline with a collection of clips to play with and at least some connected clips on top.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-320"><a id="_idTextAnchor333"/>Compositing</h2>&#13;
			<p>This section allows <a id="_idIndexMarker888"/>you to control how visible a clip is and exactly how a clip is shown to you. The <strong class="bold">Opacity</strong> slider is easiest to understand and straightforward to adjust: </p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">⌥-click</strong> on a connected clip (above other clips) to select it and move the playhead to t<span>hat point.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Drag on the <strong class="bold">Opacity</strong> value to <span>change it.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>As the value goes lower, you'll see the top clip fade away, revealing the clip(s) underneath it. While this produces an arty effect with regular video, it's far more useful with a small logo when used as a watermark:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.2: Opacity is easy to change and most useful with a<span> watermark</span></p>&#13;
			<p>However, the menu just above Opacity, the <strong class="bold">Blend Mode</strong>, is both weirder and more useful. Different blend modes change the formula that governs how a clip above is mixed with a clip below, and it's worth moving to a different connected clip to try it out. The different blend modes are:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Normal</strong> — Just display the clip as usual. If Opacity is 100% then you won't see through<span> the clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Subtract/Darken/Multiply/Color Burn/Linear Burn</strong> — These use the top clip to darken any clips. <strong class="bold">Multiply</strong> is especially handy as a "natural-looking" darkening <a id="_idIndexMarker889"/>mode, and all of these remove lighter areas fr<span>om a clip:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.3: The top clip on the left set to Multiply for a natu<span>ral darken</span></p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Add/Lighten/Screen/Color Dodge/Linear Dodge</strong> — These are lightening modes, all the opposite of the darkening modes just mentioned. <strong class="bold">Screen</strong> gives a "natural-looking" brightness <a id="_idIndexMarker890"/>boost, and these will all remove darker areas fr<span>om a clip:</span></li>&#13;

			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Overlay/Soft Light/Hard Light/Vivid Light/Linear Light/Pin Light/Hard Mix</strong> — These modes all combine the previous two categories, but you'll need to experiment with different clips. <strong class="bold">Overlay</strong> is the easiest to understand, as it's a combination of <strong class="bold">Screen</strong> on the highlights and <strong class="bold">Multiply</strong> on th<span>e shadows:</span></li>&#13;

			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Stencil Alpha/Stencil Luma/Silhouette Alpha/Silhouette Luma/Behind</strong> — These very useful <strong class="bold">masking</strong> effects are for revealing (<strong class="bold">Stencil</strong>) or hiding (<strong class="bold">Silhouette</strong>) part of a clip below, based on the brightness (<strong class="bold">Luma</strong>) or transparency (<strong class="bold">Alpha</strong>) information of the clip on top. <strong class="bold">Behind</strong> is very sneaky indeed: it virtually shuffles this top clip to the background. This enables some special techniques that we'll loo<span>k at soon:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer530" class="figure">&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.7: The top clip is set to Stencil Luma, showing the clip below where the<span>re's light</span></p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Alpha Add/Premultiplied Mix</strong> — These are for tweaking transparency (alpha) information. You probably won't need these unless you're doing something pretty<a id="_idIndexMarker892"/> fancy with masking <span>or keying.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>For most editors, Normal will be the most commonly used blend mode by far; it's the default. For ditching light or dark areas, Screen and Multiply are most handy, and while Overlay is useful, if you're adding contrast, then an S-curve in Color Curves gives far more control.</p>&#13;
			<p>Stencil Alpha is probably the most useful mode if you'd like to replace a logo with video. Alpha means "transparency," so if your top clip is a transparent PNG or another clip with a truly transparent background, you can use Stencil Alpha to play video inside the logo. (To play video outside the logo, Normal works just fine, though if you wanted to hide the non-transparent areas for some reason, Silhouette Alpha will do that.)</p>&#13;
			<p>If there's no transparency, use Stencil Luma to show lower clips in the lighter areas or Silhouette Luma to show lower clips in the darker areas:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer531" class="figure">&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.8: Silhouette Luma on the top clip deals with this logo on a white <span>background</span></p>&#13;
			<p>But these blend modes punch through all layers, not just the one immediately below. So, how do you show video inside a logo above another clip? To isolate the effect of a Stencil or<a id="_idIndexMarker893"/> Silhouette blend mode, do the following:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Select the top clip set to <strong class="bold">Stencil Alpha</strong> (or Luma) and any other clips you want t<span>o affect. </span><p>Do not select any background clips.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Create a new Compound Clip with <strong class="bold">File</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">New</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Compound Clip</strong> (<strong class="bold">⌥G</strong>) and give <span>it a name.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>The Stencil mode is now contained, limited inside the compound clip. The blank area around the logo will now show any clips underneath it in the timeline:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer532" class="figure">&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.9: The previous Silhouette Luma example wrapped in a Compound Clip, then a separate clip <span>underneath</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Compounds provide a solution to complex blending problems, but for simple problems like the one shown here, there is an alternative strategy with the Behind blend mode. Instead, with the same three clips from the previous Stencil Luma example, we can do this:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Switch to<a id="_idIndexMarker894"/> the <strong class="bold">Position</strong><span> tool (</span><span><strong class="bold">P</strong></span><span>).</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Move the background clip to the<span> very top.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Switch this top clip to the <strong class="bold">Behind</strong> b<span>lend mode:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.10: The middle clip is Stencil Luma, while the top clip is Behind and sits underneath? W<span>itchcraft!</span></p>&#13;
			<p>That's it! Oddly, you can<a id="_idIndexMarker895"/> indeed put the background at the top of the stack.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-321"><a id="_idTextAnchor334"/>Transform</h2>&#13;
			<p>This important <a id="_idIndexMarker896"/>section in the Inspector lets you change the size, position, and<a id="_idIndexMarker897"/> rotation of any clip — simple but useful stuff. It's straightforward when the aspect ratio of both your source clips and project is identical. As you'll discover soon, the situation is a little different when the two aspect ratios aren't the same, so stick with 16:9 widescreen for the moment.</p>&#13;
			<p>The Transform <a id="_idIndexMarker898"/>controls allow you to:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Make a picture-in-picture</strong> — shrink and reposition a conne<span>cted clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Correct a tilted horizon</strong> — rotate and enlarge<span> any clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Reframe a shot</strong> — scale up and move around to change the framing. (Note that Crop also provides a way to<span> do this.)</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Punch in for emphasis or disguise a jump cut</strong> — increase sc<span>ale after </span>&#13;
a jump<span> cut edit.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>To make these changes, you can use on-screen controls in the Viewer, or adjust the sliders, wheels, or (best of all) values in the Inspector. If you can't see the Inspector settings, hover to the right of Transform to reveal the word <strong class="bold">Show</strong>, and then click it:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.11: If Transform is not visible in the Inspector, be sure to Sho<span>w it first</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Those Inspector properties are as follows:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Position X</strong> (horizontal) and <strong class="bold">Y</strong> (vertical) — These change where the clip's image sits within the Viewer, in pixels. If an image starts out covering the screen exactly, then changing just this setting will push some part of it off-screen and reveal any cl<span>ips below:</span></li>&#13;

				<li><strong class="bold">Rotation</strong> — This tilts<a id="_idIndexMarker899"/> the image, in degrees. Always increase the Scale<a id="_idIndexMarker900"/> to cover the full frame, or you'll see blank areas at th<span>e corners:</span></li>&#13;

			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Scale (All)</strong> — This changes the frame size, to punch in, or to hide edges after for repositioning or rotation with the previous controls. Scaling up can create a new shot, like shooting with a zoom lens, but don't push too far. If you shoot 1080p and deliver 1080p, then pushing past 120% can produce noticeable softening, as the missing pixels must be created through interpolation. This is a big reason why shooting 4K for 1080p delivery is popular; you can zoom in up to 200% before you run out of real pixels. <em class="italic">Don't use </em><strong class="bold">Scale X or Scale Y</strong><em class="italic"> unless you want to distort </em><span><em class="italic">the image</em></span><span>:</span></li>&#13;

			</ul>&#13;
			<p>The on-screen Transform controls can be enabled by pressing a white icon found in two places:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>To the right of the word <strong class="bold">Transform</strong> in the <span><strong class="bold">Inspector</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>In the leftmost corner below the <strong class="bold">Viewer</strong>, next to a menu that lets you access on-screen controls for <strong class="bold">Transform</strong>, <strong class="bold">Crop</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Distort</strong>. If the <strong class="bold">Transform</strong> icon is on top here, you can click the icon to activate its on-screen controls, but if it's not, you'll have to choose <strong class="bold">Transform</strong> from the menu n<span>ext to it:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer538" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_12.15_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.15: The blue on-screen controls for Transform are found in two places — click either icon to<span> toggle it</span></p>&#13;
			<p>When on-screen controls are active, the clip's Position can be changed by dragging anywhere within<a id="_idIndexMarker903"/> the frame in the Viewer or on the center point. Dragging the <a id="_idIndexMarker904"/>small handle attached to the center point adjusts Rotation, and dragging any of the corner handles adjusts Scale. (The edge handles adjust only X or Y, so mostly avoid those.)</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">IMPORTANT NOTE</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout"><em class="italic">New in the 10.4.9 release</em>, it's now possible to see what's happening outside the visible image area in the Viewer, with <strong class="bold">Transform Overscan</strong>. A small icon to the left of the <strong class="bold">Reset</strong> button toggles this display and allows you to see which parts of a selected clip are off-screen and invisible. This is easiest to see if you zoom out slightly with the menu above the Viewer.</p>&#13;
			<p>The on-screen controls are convenient, but the numbers in the Inspector are more precise, so don't be afraid to use both systems. To move a clip horizontally or vertically, dragging on a Position value in the Inspector is a safer choice because you'll automatically limit movement to a single dimension.</p>&#13;
			<p>For similar reasons, the on-screen scale controls seem like a good idea, but as soon as a clip is made larger, the handles quickly vanish beyond the edges of the Viewer. It's also easy to accidentally resize the Viewer when trying to adjust the scale handles, so I usually end up adjusting the Inspector values instead. (If you do want to use on-screen controls for scale, you may find that you need to reduce the View percentage to 50% or 25% rather than using the default "Fit" setting.) As an alternative, you may find it easier to use the Crop options discussed in the next section:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer539" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_12.16_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.16: Reduce View percentage to see all of the on-screen controls; both clips are selected at<span> once here</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Lastly, the Rotation <a id="_idIndexMarker905"/>handle works well enough if you drag it a long way from the<a id="_idIndexMarker906"/> center point (for accuracy) but the values in the Inspector offer finer control. If you do use the on-screen controls, always remember to press <strong class="bold">Done</strong> in the top-left corner of the Viewer or by clicking on the (now blue) on-screen controls icon once again. While on-screen controls are active, Skimming doesn't work, so it's important to turn them off when you're done.</p>&#13;
			<p>While on-screen controls are active, a <strong class="bold">Reset</strong> button sits next to <strong class="bold">Done</strong> if you want to start from scratch. For finer control, hover over the far-right side of any property in the Transform panel to see a hooked arrow Reset button appear; clicking it resets that property alone. Hover to the far right of the word Transform to see a hooked arrow that <a id="_idIndexMarker907"/>resets all options at once.</p>&#13;
			<p>Just<a id="_idIndexMarker908"/> below Transform, you'll find the next important section.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-322"><a id="_idTextAnchor335"/>Crop</h2>&#13;
			<p>Unlike the Transform<a id="_idIndexMarker909"/> controls, the on-screen controls here are quite <a id="_idIndexMarker910"/>important. While you can switch between the options using the Inspector, the best way to start is to press the <strong class="bold">Crop</strong> on-screen control icon and look at the Viewer. The bottom of this display shows the three Crop options:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Trim</strong> — This removes <a id="_idIndexMarker911"/>parts of the edge of the frame and is useful to turn a rectangle into a square for picture-in-picture purposes or to reveal part of a clip un<span>derneath. </span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Crop</strong> — An alternative to Scale, this is another, more direct way to punch in, which lets you choose exactly which part of the image<span> to show. </span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Ken Burns</strong> — This is an animated way to automatically pan or zoom acros<span>s a frame.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>To look at these in more detail, we'll use the on-screen controls.</p>&#13;
			<p><strong class="bold">Trim</strong> gives you simple controls to remove pixels from the left, right, top, or bottom edges, and that's about it. Personally, I don't use this often; I find that effects, generators, or titles can give better results more quickly, but it's easy to understand:</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.17: Drag on these edge controls to trim off the edges<span> of a clip</span></p>&#13;
			<p><strong class="bold">Crop</strong> is great for punching in. While scaling up and moving over with the Transform controls is a perfectly good option, you've seen that the on-screen scale controls are difficult to use for this purpose. The Crop mode here lets you see the whole image while you choose which part<a id="_idIndexMarker912"/> of it to show, dragging the frame to reposition and dragging the edges <a id="_idIndexMarker913"/>or corners to rescale:</p>&#13;

			<p class="callout-heading">IMPORTANT NOTE</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">For the simplest delivery <a id="_idIndexMarker914"/>to multiple aspect ratios, you'll want to shoot wider than <a id="_idIndexMarker915"/>normal, preferably in a higher resolution and with the normal amount of space between your subject's head at the top of the frame — the "common top" strategy discussed in <a href="B15343_02_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor044"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Before the Edit: Production Tips</em>. When you crop or scale to reframe for different aspect ratios, place the top of the clip at the top of the frame to maintain the common distance, and be more flexible with the sides and bottom edges. Also, note that <strong class="bold">Spatial Conform</strong> (at the bottom of the Inspector) will affect Scale or Crop settings, so choose one or the other. Spatial Conform is a good first step.</p>&#13;
			<p><strong class="bold">Ken Burns</strong>, named for the documentary filmmaker's signature effect, performs an automatic animation between two defined Start and End crop boxes. Click on either box to control its size and position, and try a few configurations:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>One box inside the other produc<span>es a zoom.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>One box above the other produc<span>es a tilt.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>One box beside the other produ<span>ces a pan.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>These can be combined, as in a smaller box to the lower right of a l<span>arger box.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>It's easy to swap the current Start and End boxes around with the button to the top left, and just to the right is a button that previews the current effect:</p>&#13;

			<p>While the technique was invented to give life to still photos from the American Civil War, it works <a id="_idIndexMarker916"/>with <a id="_idIndexMarker917"/>video too and can be quite effective. </p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">IMPORTANT NOTE</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout"><strong class="bold">Ken Burns</strong> is a great effect, but it will always start at the very beginning of a clip and finish at the very end. If you need more flexibility than this, such as a late start or an early finish, search for and install the free effect <strong class="bold">Alex4D Grow/Shrink</strong>.</p>&#13;
			<p>Click <strong class="bold">Done</strong> when you're finished, and try this out on a series of back-to-back stills to see how it looks. You'll find that the effect varies a little along the timeline, and that a quick crossfade applied to all clips (<strong class="bold">⌘</strong><strong class="bold">T</strong>) really helps. There will be more on transitions soon.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-323"><a id="_idTextAnchor336"/>Distort</h2>&#13;
			<p>This last set of <a id="_idIndexMarker918"/>properties let you control the corner positions of a clip, and <a id="_idIndexMarker919"/>the on-screen controls are probably the easiest way to perform this "corner-pinning" task. If you need to perform a screen replacement (and the screen isn't moving), then this works well. After you activate the on-screen controls, do the following:</p>&#13;
			<p><em class="italic">Move the corner handles</em> to adjust a single corner point.</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1"><em class="italic">Move the side handles</em> to adjust two corner points<span> together.</span></li>&#13;

			<p>For finer control, you <a id="_idIndexMarker920"/>may find you need to zoom in, which you can do with <strong class="bold">⌘plus</strong> or<a id="_idIndexMarker921"/> with the zoom-level menu at the top of the Viewer. When zoomed in, you'll see a small widget to the right of the Viewer, which uses a red box to indicate which part of the frame you're looking at. Drag that red box to reposition, and press <strong class="bold">⇧Z</strong> to return to the <strong class="bold">Fit</strong> view when done. Here's an illustration:</p>&#13;

			<p>Not everyone needs <a id="_idIndexMarker922"/>to replace screens, though. If you find that you don't use this very<a id="_idIndexMarker923"/> much, hover over the word <strong class="bold">Distort</strong>, then click <strong class="bold">Hide</strong> to the right.</p>&#13;
			<p>For our next trick, we will make hand-held shots more stable.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-324"><a id="_idTextAnchor337"/>Stabilization</h2>&#13;
			<p>If your shot is<a id="_idIndexMarker924"/> shaky due to unsteady hands or filming while moving, you<a id="_idIndexMarker925"/> may be able to fix the problem by activating <strong class="bold">Stabilization</strong>. Turn it on, wait for the clip to be analyzed, and then play the clip through to see how it looks.</p>&#13;
			<p>One of two methods will be selected, depending on the kind of shake detected:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">InertiaCam</strong> is the preferred option but only works with lower amounts of shake. If needed, <strong class="bold">Smoothing</strong> can be turned up or down, and there's also a <strong class="bold">Tripod Mode</strong> checkbox that eliminates all<span> movement.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">SmoothCam</strong> will be automatically selected if the movement was too strong for <strong class="bold">InertiaCam</strong>, but it can also be manually chosen if needed. The power of this option is that separate <strong class="bold">Translation Smooth</strong>, <strong class="bold">Rotation Smooth</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Scale Smooth</strong> sliders can be adjusted, but there's no Tripod <span>Mode here:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;

			<p>If you can't get a good<a id="_idIndexMarker926"/> result after playing with all of the options here, then you'll <a id="_idIndexMarker927"/>have to replace the shot. Next time, use a gimbal for a moving shot or a tripod for a static shot.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-325"><a id="_idTextAnchor338"/>Rolling Shutter</h2>&#13;
			<p>By their nature, the <a id="_idIndexMarker928"/>sensors inside most cameras don't record the <a id="_idIndexMarker929"/>entire frame in one instant, but scan from top to bottom. This means that if a camera or its subject is moving quickly, the image may be at an angle:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer547" class="figure">&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.24: When you move cameras too quickly, vertical utility poles lea<span>n sideways</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Rolling Shutter tries to fix this and allows for several levels of correction, but the problem can be <a id="_idIndexMarker930"/>tricky to fix, especially when objects move quickly. Try<a id="_idIndexMarker931"/> to pan more slowly if your camera suffers from this.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-326"><a id="_idTextAnchor339"/>Spatial Conform</h2>&#13;
			<p>If your footage is a<a id="_idIndexMarker932"/> different aspect ratio to your timeline, for <a id="_idIndexMarker933"/>example, if you're delivering to square for social media, then you'll want to choose how your footage is shown:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Fit</strong> — Show the entire frame, but leave black areas blank around<span> the clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Fill</strong> — Zoom the clip up to fill the entire frame, cropping the edges of<span> the clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">None</strong> — Don't change the si<span>ze at all:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.25: These three modes are great as a starting point or for further Scale and Positio<span>n tweaking</span></p>&#13;
			<p>You can use the Crop and Transform properties with any of these options, but <strong class="bold">Spatial Conform</strong> is designed to be used as a first step. If you change Scale and then change Spatial Transform to Fill, it'll zoom in more than you might expect.</p>&#13;
			<p>A new alternative to Spatial Conform is <strong class="bold">Smart Conform</strong>, <em class="italic">added in the 10.4.9 release</em>. Select one <a id="_idIndexMarker934"/>or more clips, then choose <strong class="bold">Modify</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Smart Conform</strong> to <a id="_idIndexMarker935"/>intelligently scale and reposition your images according to their actual content. Because this is especially useful for delivering to multiple aspect ratios, we will use this in <a href="B15343_16_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor491"><em class="italic">Chapter 16</em></a>, <em class="italic">You're Done: Exporting Your Edit and Fin</em><em class="italic">ishing Up</em>.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-327"><a id="_idTextAnchor340"/>Rate Conform</h2>&#13;
			<p>This frame rate control <a id="_idIndexMarker936"/>is only present if the frame rate of your clip <a id="_idIndexMarker937"/>doesn't match the frame rate of your timeline. The options here govern which frames are shown, but if you have a slight mismatch, it's likely that none of the basic options here (<strong class="bold">Floor</strong>, <strong class="bold">Nearest Neighbor</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Frame Blending</strong>) will look terrific. If you encounter this problem, address it with one of these options:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Use <strong class="bold">Retime</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Automatic Speed</strong> (discussed in <a href="B15343_13_PreFinal_Apple_JM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor378"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></a>, <em class="italic">Blend and Warp: Video Transitions and Retiming</em>) to change the clip speed to match the timeline f<span>rame rate.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Use the <strong class="bold">Optical Flow</strong> method to intelligently create new frames <span>as needed:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.26: Optical flow effectively morphs between neighboring frames, like most TVs do with the dreaded "motion <span>smoothing"</span></p>&#13;
			<p>With any luck, you've<a id="_idIndexMarker938"/> shot your footage at the right frame rate, and this<a id="_idIndexMarker939"/> won't be &#13;
an issue.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-328"><a id="_idTextAnchor341"/>Review — Adjusting video properties</h2>&#13;
			<p>You've learned a lot <a id="_idIndexMarker940"/>about video properties, but it's all consistent and easy to navigate. Use the on-screen controls if you wish or drag on values in the Inspector for precision. If you <strong class="bold">⌥-click</strong> every time you select a clip, you'll avoid all confusion.</p>&#13;
			<p>Moving a duplicate timeline to a new aspect ratio is simple these days and made even easier if you've framed the original shots with reframing in mind. If you're not the cinematographer, ask them (nicely) to shoot wider, with a common top line in mind, and you'll get great results.</p>&#13;
			<p>Even for a single aspect ratio delivery, don't be afraid to punch in a little (or a lot) to give yourself new framing options in the edit. You'll be able to use this technique far more effectively if you can oversample, recording in a larger resolution than you need to deliver, and you've learned multiple ways to do that with crop and scale.</p>&#13;
			<p>But what about moving shots? So far, all of these controls (except Ken Burns) have been static, but they absolutely can change over time. In the next section, you'll learn how to animate them.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-329"><a id="_idTextAnchor342"/>Animating with keyframes</h1>&#13;
			<p>Animation <a id="_idIndexMarker941"/>doesn't necessarily mean movement — it means changing<a id="_idIndexMarker942"/> the value of a property over time. You could:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><em class="italic">Fade a clip in or out</em> by animatin<span>g </span><span><strong class="bold">Opacity</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;

			<p><strong class="bold">Keyframing</strong> is a universal <a id="_idIndexMarker943"/>solution that can be applied to almost any property in the Inspector — those are just a starting point. Here, we will start with the Inspector-focused controls, move across to the Timeline's controls, and then pop back to the Viewer too. If keyframes are too hard, there are alternatives, and you'll find out about those as well.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-330"><a id="_idTextAnchor343"/>Animating in the Inspector</h2>&#13;
			<p>The keyframing <a id="_idIndexMarker944"/>system in the Inspector is <a id="_idIndexMarker945"/>bare-bones, but it still provides a simple, clean way to understand and control any property. For this exercise, you'll need two different clips placed above one another in the timeline, and you'll be working on the previous connected clip. However, now that you'll be changing an effect over time, you'll need to consider not just <em class="italic">what</em> the properties are, but <em class="italic">when</em> a property's values need to change. Keyframes are indicated by diamonds, and each one stores a value (<em class="italic">what</em>) at a point in time (<em class="italic">when</em>).</p>&#13;
			<p>In the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong>, you'll see arrows that jump between keyframes on the left, then a blank space if there's no keyframe or a yellow diamond if there is one:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer551" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_12.28_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.28: No keyframe is shown on the left, but you can see a yellow keyframe on<span> the right</span></p>&#13;
			<p>But hover the mouse over the spot where a keyframe lives and you'll see what will happen if you click: the <strong class="bold">+</strong> and <strong class="bold">–</strong> only appear while you hover. A black outlined diamond with a plus indicates there is no keyframe, though you can click to add one. Hovering over a keyframe shows a minus, and you can click to delete that keyframe:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.29: If you see a plus you're going to add a keyframe; a minus means you're going to <span>delete one</span></p>&#13;
			<p>We'll take this step<a id="_idIndexMarker946"/> by step, with examples of how you<a id="_idIndexMarker947"/> might choose to animate several sections in the Inspector.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-331"><a id="_idTextAnchor344"/>Animating the Crop property</h3>&#13;
			<p>Crop is a good<a id="_idIndexMarker948"/> place to start — it's obvious, it<a id="_idIndexMarker949"/> can look quite good, and it's easy to understand. Here, you'll animate the Left Crop edge in, from a large value down to zero. If you've already adjusted Crop on this clip, reset it before you begin, and make sure you're on the default <strong class="bold">Tri</strong><strong class="bold">m</strong> setting:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">⌥-click</strong> on the connected clip, two seconds from its start point, to select it and move the playhead to that poin<span>t in time.</span><p>To animate a clip on to the screen, start with a keyframe at the <em class="italic">end</em> of that animation, locking in the "normal" property first — it's far easier. </p></li>&#13;
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong>, to the right of the <strong class="bold">Left</strong> property in the <strong class="bold">Crop</strong> section, press the diamond with a <strong class="bold">+</strong> to create a new<span> keyframe:</span><div id="_idContainer553" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_12.30_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.30: When you're at the correct time, press the<span> + diamond</span></p><p>A keyframe remembers a value at a point in time, and you've just locked in "normal" for this clip. The keyframe is now shown as a yellow diamond, and if you move the mouse away, you'll see it. Don't click the same button again, as it now shows a <strong class="bold">–</strong> inside the diamond as you hover over it, and clicking that would remove the keyframe. </p></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">↑</strong> to move the playhead back to the start of the cur<span>rent clip.</span><p>Once a keyframe has been created on a particular property, changing that value at a different point in time will automatically create a new keyframe. </p></li>&#13;
				<li>Drag on<a id="_idIndexMarker950"/> the<a id="_idIndexMarker951"/> value for <strong class="bold">Left</strong> (initially <strong class="bold">0</strong>) until the clip entirely d<span>isappears:</span><div id="_idContainer554" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_12.31_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.31: Changing the value while at a new point in time (the start) creates a secon<span>d keyframe</span></p><p>You'll have to drag this value out to at least the width of this clip. Note that the slider probably won't go far enough — always drag on the numbers directly.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Play through this clip to see the <strong class="bold">Crop</strong> <strong class="bold">Left</strong> propert<span>y animate.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>Importantly, if you were to change any other Crop property, no animation would be created because each property has independent keyframes. You only need to click the <strong class="bold">+ </strong><em class="italic">inside the diamond</em> once on each property, but that first keyframe is important.</p>&#13;
			<p>The exception to this is that sometimes, you'll want to lock in the same value twice. For example, you might start a value at 0%, increase it to 50%, stay at 50% for five seconds, and then fade back down to 0% again. For that, you'd lock in two identical keyframes in a row in the middle of the clip, and you would use the <strong class="bold">+</strong> inside the diamond to add that second keyframe. To help <a id="_idIndexMarker952"/>you visualize that, here's a graph of what you would be aiming for <a id="_idIndexMarker953"/>with <strong class="bold">Opacity</strong>:</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.32: From 0 to 50, to 50, to 0, as shown in a Video Animation graph, c<span>oming soon</span></p>&#13;
			<p>One final note is that if you ever need a keyframe on the final frame in a clip, you can't just press <strong class="bold">↓</strong> because that jumps to the start of the next clip. Instead, you need to press <strong class="bold">↓</strong>, then <strong class="bold">←</strong> to jump back one frame.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-332"><a id="_idTextAnchor345"/>Animating a color correction</h3>&#13;
			<p>Color corrections<a id="_idIndexMarker954"/> can be animated too. If the<a id="_idIndexMarker955"/> light changes while recording a shot, then you can compensate for that change by locking in two different exposure settings — darkening the lighter part of the shot and lightening the darker part of the shot. To learn the technique, any shot will do:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">⌥-click</strong> on a clip to select it and move the playhead to t<span>hat point.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">⌘6</strong> to add the default color correction to <span>this clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Use the keyboard controls (JKL and arrow keys) to <strong class="bold">move to an early point</strong> in<span> the clip.</span><p>Using the keyboard here means that you can't accidentally deselect the clip. If you want to use the mouse instead, drag in the ruler bar at the top of the timeline to avoid losing your selection.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Correct the Color/Saturation/Exposure as you wish at this point in<span> the clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Hover in the<a id="_idIndexMarker956"/> title bar for this correction, and click the <strong class="bold">+</strong> inside the diamond to create a new<a id="_idIndexMarker957"/><span> keyframe:</span><div id="_idContainer556" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_12.33_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.33: The keyframe controls at the top lock in the entire panel below at a spe<span>cific time</span></p><p>The color correction<a id="_idIndexMarker958"/> is now locked in at this point in time.

				<li>Use the keyboard controls to <strong class="bold">move along the clip</strong> a couple o<span>f seconds.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Correct the Color/Saturation/Exposure as you wish, making an obvio<span>us change.</span></li>&#13;

			<p>In a real-world situation, this technique works if you can add a keyframe on the exact frame where the exposure starts to shift and another on the exact frame where it finishes that shift. Of course, you can always hide this transition with a cutaway on top instead.</p>&#13;
			<p>If you mess <a id="_idIndexMarker960"/>everything up, click on the<a id="_idIndexMarker961"/> hooked <strong class="bold">Reset</strong> arrow (or choose <strong class="bold">Reset Parameter</strong> from the small menu to the right of the keyframe controls) and you can start from scratch.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-333"><a id="_idTextAnchor346"/>Animating a mask</h3>&#13;
			<p>You'll probably be <a id="_idIndexMarker962"/>able to figure out this process by <a id="_idIndexMarker963"/>now, but yes, you can animate masks too — ideal for tracking a person or object as they move around a shot. If you want to try this out, follow these steps:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">⌥-click</strong> on a clip to select it and move the playhead to t<span>hat point.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">⌘6</strong> to add the default color correction to this clip, and make an obvious change, such as darkening<span> the clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>From the <strong class="bold">Mask</strong> icon at the top of the correction, add a <strong class="bold">S</strong><span><strong class="bold">hape Mask</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Change the shape and size of the mask to roughly match the position of an object in <span>the frame.</span><p>You can invert the mask if you would prefer the correction to sit outside the mask shape.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Move to a point in time where the object start<span>s to move.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>At the lower part of the Inspector, next to <strong class="bold">Shape Mask 1</strong>, click the <strong class="bold">+</strong> inside the diamond to create a<span> keyframe:</span><div id="_idContainer557" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_12.34_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.34: Make sure to use the keyframe controls in the ma<span>sk section</span></p><p>You've now locked in the position, shape, and size of this mask.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Use the keyboard <a id="_idIndexMarker964"/>controls to move along the <a id="_idIndexMarker965"/>clip, ideally to a point where that object sto<span>ps moving.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Move the mask to where that object is p<span>ositioned.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Skim backward and forward to make sure that the mask follows the object throughout<span> the clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>At any point in time, move the mask to more closely match the object position to lock in another<span> keyframe.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>You could place a new keyframe every few seconds or at every point when the direction or speed changes, but try to keep this effect smooth. Use as few keyframes as you can get away with — too many can appear jerky:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer558" class="figure">&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.35: This person floating in the waves is now tracked across the clip, with a so<span>ft outline</span></p>&#13;
			<p>When a mask requires extreme precision, you may be tempted to put a keyframe on every single frame for accuracy, but know that it's very hard to get this right by hand. If this is the kind of task <a id="_idIndexMarker966"/>you'll be performing often, consider purchasing a third-party tracking <a id="_idIndexMarker967"/>plugin. You can also try using a shape mask with a soft edge, to make any minor mistakes less noticeable.</p>&#13;
			<p>Mistakes can also be fixed by re-editing existing keyframes, and that's easy.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-334"><a id="_idTextAnchor347"/>Editing keyframes in the Inspector</h3>&#13;
			<p>Once keyframes<a id="_idIndexMarker968"/> have been added to a property, it's common to <a id="_idIndexMarker969"/>want to jump back to those existing keyframes. This allows you to change the setting recorded at a keyframe and to delete a keyframe outright. To move to existing keyframes, look to the left of a property's keyframe diamond to see two additional arrows:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>To move to the previous keyframe, press the <em class="italic">Previous Keyframe l</em><span><em class="italic">eft arrow</em></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>To move to the next keyframe, press the <em class="italic">Next Keyframe l</em><span><em class="italic">eft arrow</em></span><span>:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer559" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_12.36_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.36: Previous and Next are the two buttons to the left of the keyframe<span> icon here</span></p>&#13;
			<p>And to recap the keyframe diamond, we can do the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>While on a keyframe, press the <strong class="bold">–</strong> in the diamond (hover to see the minus sign) to <span>delete it.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>While not on a keyframe, press the <strong class="bold">+</strong> in the diamond to create a new keyframe and record the curr<span>ent value.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>While these <a id="_idIndexMarker970"/>controls are fine for simple tasks with just a few <a id="_idIndexMarker971"/>keyframes, it's possible to manipulate keyframes on the timeline too; read on.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-335"><a id="_idTextAnchor348"/>Animating on the timeline with Video Animation</h3>&#13;
			<p>Video Animation<a id="_idIndexMarker972"/> provides<a id="_idIndexMarker973"/> a better way to see<a id="_idIndexMarker974"/> exactly when a keyframe has been recorded, though it doesn't usually provide a full traditional keyframe graph. To see this in action, you'll need a clip with keyframes applied to video properties in the Inspector — any of the previous clips will do:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">⌥-click</strong> on a clip to select it and move the playhead to t<span>hat point.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">⌃V</strong> to display <strong class="bold">Video Animation</strong> for this clip in the<span> Timeline.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>The new <strong class="bold">Video Animation</strong> section displays small diamonds to indicate when a keyframe has been placed on any and all video-related properties for this clip:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer560" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_12.37_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.37: Now you can see all the keyframes for the previous Shape Mask moveme<span>nt at once</span></p>&#13;
			<p>However, remember that each color correction and each area in the Inspector has several properties you can keyframe. As they may have been animated independently, you should choose which one to focus on, because viewing <strong class="bold">All</strong> properties for an area doesn't differentiate between the different types of keyframes.</p>&#13;
			<p>For example, if you have a Color Board with a Shape Mask, you could view <strong class="bold">All</strong>, <strong class="bold">Inside Correction</strong>, <strong class="bold">Outside Correction</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Shape Mask 1</strong>. Switching to any individual property allows those keyframes to be repositioned in time or deleted, while other areas are shown<a id="_idIndexMarker975"/> in<a id="_idIndexMarker976"/> black and are protected<a id="_idIndexMarker977"/> from editing:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.38: With Shape Mask 1 selected, Inside and Outside Correction keyframes can'<span>t be moved</span></p>&#13;
			<p>As well as moving in time and deleting, it's also possible to create a new keyframe for any property by <strong class="bold">⌥-clicking</strong> on its keyframe line. (This is also a workflow that can be used for controlling audio volume keyframes, but more on that in the next chapter.) However, most properties here offer only a single dimension. You can see <em class="italic">when</em> a keyframe is positioned, but <em class="italic">not the value stored</em> at that point in time. For that, you'll need to glance up to the Inspector, and the two areas do work pretty well together.</p>&#13;
			<p>However, there is one property here that can be expanded to a two-dimensional graph — Opacity. Pushing the small icon to the right of the Opacity line causes this section to grow vertically, to show both time and Opacity for this clip:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.39: When you push the icon to the right, you'll expand<span> the graph</span></p>&#13;
			<p>To vary Opacity over time with this graph:</p>&#13;

				<li value="1">In <strong class="bold">Video Animation</strong>, click the small icon to the right of the Opacity line to display the Opac<span>ity graph.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold"> ⌥-click</strong> twice on the Opacity line to create two new <span>keyframes:</span><div id="_idContainer563" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_12.40_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.40: Hold ⌥ and the cursor will change, to indicate a new keyframe will <span>be created</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Drag <a id="_idIndexMarker978"/>one<a id="_idIndexMarker979"/> keyframe up<a id="_idIndexMarker980"/> or down to change the value at that poin<span>t in time:</span></li>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.41: Dragging that second keyframe creates animation between the two<span> keyframes</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The animation between two keyframes is usually <strong class="bold">Linear</strong>, meaning that the change happens at a continuous speed:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer565" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_12.42_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.42: The four different types of graphs affect how the change is made between two<span> keyframes</span></p>&#13;
			<p>For a more natural result, you can right-click on the line between two keyframes, then choose a new curve type:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Linear</strong> — continuous speed, the default (no acc<span>eleration)</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Ease</strong> — the change starts slow, speeds up in the middle, and slows down at the end (accelerating, then dec<span>elerating)</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Ease In</strong> — the change starts slow, speeding up toward the end (acc<span>elerating)</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Ease Out</strong> — the change starts fast, slowing down toward the end (dec<span>elerating)</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Notably, of the<a id="_idIndexMarker981"/> standard <a id="_idIndexMarker982"/>video properties, only <a id="_idIndexMarker983"/>Opacity offers this graph, and therefore most properties can only be animated in a Linear way. You'll see soon that some other properties will show a graph, but only if they exist in a range of 0–100, like a percentage.</p>&#13;
			<p>Incidentally, right-clicking on audio fade handles offers a similar set of curve options, though the default <strong class="bold">+3dB</strong> option is often the best. There will be more on that in <a href="B15343_14_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor404"><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em></a>, <em class="italic">Boost the Signal: Audio S</em><em class="italic">weetening</em>.</p>&#13;
			<p>The keyframe graph does offer one additional trick, which is that you can fade any clip in or out with built-in fade handles. These work in a very similar way to the audio fade handles that were discussed in <a href="B15343_08_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor227"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Neaten the Edges: Trimming Techniques</em>, and which will be revisited <a href="B15343_14_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor404"><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em></a>, <em class="italic">Boost the Signal: Audio S</em><em class="italic">weetening</em>:</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.43: Fade handles for Opacity, built-in <span>and useful</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Look to the left and right edges of the Opacity graph to see the familiar teardrop shape, then drag that teardrop inward to create a fade in or out. These fades always occur at the start or end of the clip (even after trimming) while keyframes remain fixed in time.</p>&#13;
			<p>In <a href="B15343_13_PreFinal_Apple_JM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor378"><em class="italic">C</em><em class="italic">hapter 13</em></a><em class="italic">, Blend and Warp: Transitions and Retiming</em>, you'll learn about transitions, which are usually the easiest way to fade a clip in or <a id="_idIndexMarker984"/>out, but <a id="_idIndexMarker985"/>from time to time this <a id="_idIndexMarker986"/>technique can be a useful alternative.</p>&#13;
			<p>When you're done with Video Animation, you can hide it to simplify your timeline:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">⌃V</strong> to hide <strong class="bold">Video </strong><span><strong class="bold">Animation</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Now that you know how to work with the Inspector and the Video Animation pane, it's time to head back to the Viewer.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-336"><a id="_idTextAnchor349"/>Animating in the Viewer</h2>&#13;
			<p>While the Viewer only<a id="_idIndexMarker987"/> allows you to work with<a id="_idIndexMarker988"/> the Transform, Crop, and Distort properties, it does let you control some parameters in uniquely powerful ways. Firstly, the Viewer displays buttons in its top-left corner to allow you to:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Jump to the previous<span> keyframe.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Add or delete a keyframe at the curr<span>ent frame.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Jump to the next<span> keyframe.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>With these controls, it's possible to use the on-screen controls in the Viewer for basic keyframe management and navigation:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer567" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_12.44_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.44: Additional, conveniently placed keyframe buttons in the top left of <span>the Viewer</span></p>&#13;
			<p>You'll still need Video Animation if you want to <em class="italic">move</em> a keyframe in time, but the duplication is convenient. The best reason to use these controls is for the most traditional kind of animation: creating movement by animating <strong class="bold">Position</strong>. To explore this, you'll need one clip above another as before, but this time we'll create and animate a fly-on picture-in-picture effect:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">⌥-click</strong> on the connected clip above to select it and move the playhead to t<span>hat point.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>In the Viewer, activate the<strong class="bold"> Transform</strong> on-screen controls with the menu in the bottom-le<span>ft corner.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Shrink the clip <a id="_idIndexMarker989"/>down to about 25% by <a id="_idIndexMarker990"/>adjusting its blue corner handles or by using the <strong class="bold">Scale (All)</strong> parameter in the <span>Inspector.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Click on the clip and move it to near the top-le<span>ft corner.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Use the keyboard controls (or drag in the timeline ruler) to move to a point in time about a second in from the start of<span> the clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>In the top-left corner of the Viewer, click the <strong class="bold">Add Keyframe</strong> button to lock in the position at t<span>hat point.</span><p>This will add keyframes to all of the Transform properties:</p><div id="_idContainer568" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_12.45_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.45: All of those diamonds mean that a lot of properties have been lock<span>ed in here</span></p><p>If you only change Position from this point, that won't cause any problems, but the on-screen controls will keyframe every Transform property together.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Zoom the <strong class="bold">Viewer</strong> out by pressing <strong class="bold">⌘mi</strong><span><strong class="bold">nus</strong></span><span> twice.</span><p>Most of the time, you'll <a id="_idIndexMarker991"/>stay with the default <strong class="bold">Fit</strong> view (<strong class="bold">⇧Z</strong>), but<a id="_idIndexMarker992"/> for this task, you'll need to see the area outside the canvas. Make sure you've toggled the <strong class="bold">Transform Overscan</strong> button to the left of the <strong class="bold">Reset</strong> button on so that you can see everything you need.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">↑</strong> to move to the first frame of <span>this clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Move the top clip to the left, outside t<span>he canvas.</span><p>You'll see a red line joining the current Position (where the blue handles surround the clip outline) and the first keyframe you created:</p><div id="_idContainer569" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_12.46_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.46: A full motion path is shown if you want to do this sor<span>t of thing</span></p><p>Every Position keyframe will be shown in the Viewer, from the first point (an arrow, indented on both sides) through intermediate keyframes (diamonds) to the last point (an arrow, indented on one side only).</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Click <strong class="bold">Done</strong>, then Skim through this area of the clip to see the <span>animation.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>You may notice that<a id="_idIndexMarker993"/> there's some acceleration on these<a id="_idIndexMarker994"/> movements, and that's because position keyframes default to <strong class="bold">Smooth</strong>, similar to the Ease discussed with Opacity. Unless you choose otherwise, the transition between two keyframes will accelerate in and decelerate out. It's usually fine, but if you want to remove the speed changes:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Right-click on any Position keyframe and choose <strong class="bold">Linear</strong> instead of the curre<span>nt </span><span><strong class="bold">Smooth</strong></span><span>:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer570" class="figure">&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.47: To choose Linear versus Smooth, right-click <span>on a point</span></p>&#13;
			<p>This change can be applied to any position keyframe, but Smooth is probably a good option for a movement like this, helping the picture-in-picture to come to a slightly more gentle halt. Note that you can change any Crop setting here, and because they haven't had any keyframes applied, no Crop animation will be added.</p>&#13;
			<p>If you mess <a id="_idIndexMarker995"/>anything up, Undo or Reset and give it <a id="_idIndexMarker996"/>another shot. If you're attempting a complex animation and becoming frustrated, perhaps consider another way forward.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-337"><a id="_idTextAnchor350"/>Alternative animation methods</h2>&#13;
			<p>These animation <a id="_idIndexMarker997"/>controls work well for simpler jobs, but for finer control, you'll have to approach the problem in a different way. If you need full manual control over keyframes, with custom easing handles, consider using Apple's companion product, <strong class="bold">Motion</strong>. This excellent (and inexpensive) program allows not just manual keyframing, but also an alternative animation strategy — behaviors:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer571" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_12.48_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.48: Motion is a spectacular program for motion graphics and works amazingly well <span>with FCP X</span></p>&#13;
			<p>While you can use Motion to create a one-off animation piece, the recommended approach is to use Motion to create a template: a generator, a title, an effect, or a transition that can be used directly back in FCP X. This strategy allows far more complex and sophisticated animations to be pre-built, either by you or as part of a third-party animation toolkit. The <a id="_idIndexMarker998"/>free "Alex4D Grow/Shrink" effect mentioned earlier uses behaviors to create a scaling animation, and there are far more complex options available too. You'll learn more about effects and transitions very soon, so stay tuned.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-338"><a id="_idTextAnchor351"/>Review — Animating with keyframes</h2>&#13;
			<p>Mastering the art <a id="_idIndexMarker999"/>of keyframes will expand what you can do as an editor because you'll be able to quickly make your clients happy. If you need to fake a zoom with animation, you'll need to know how to keyframe <strong class="bold">Scale (All)</strong>; if you want to add a pan or tilt, you can scale up, then keyframe two <strong class="bold">Positions</strong>. Add that keyframe in the Inspector if you wish, by <strong class="bold">⌥-clicking</strong> in <strong class="bold">Video Animation</strong>, or even in the Viewer: the principle is the same.</p>&#13;
			<p>When planning an animation, try to keep it simple; two keyframes are a good place to start. And if you're using two keyframes to animate a clip in, always lock in the later keyframe first to record the clip's normal properties. With the later keyframe recording normality at the end of the animation, you can add your earlier keyframe and go crazy with spins, fades, or movements. But if it's too hard? Motion, and third-party plugins made with Motion, will give you plenty of other options.</p>&#13;
			<p>Speaking of options, it's time to widen your horizons with a look at video effects.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-339"><a id="_idTextAnchor352"/>Applying and using video effects</h1>&#13;
			<p>This topic is<a id="_idIndexMarker1000"/> huge, but if you want to blur, glitch, focus, sharpen, warp, distort, or <a id="_idIndexMarker1001"/>otherwise stylize your clips visually, video effects are the way to get that done. Found in the <strong class="bold">Effects Browser</strong> to the lower-right of the interface, there are over a hundred effects included by default, and that's enough to get started with. When you need some more, you can install hundreds of additional third-party effects (free and paid) or even make your own with Motion. As you'll see, some effects have only a few controls in the Inspector, while others include many customizable options with draggable on-screen controls:</p>&#13;

			<p>But — surprise! — you've actually used effects already. The color corrections you added in the previous chapter are video effects, from the Color category of the Effects pane. While color correction instances are edited in the Color area of the Inspector, they can all be <a id="_idIndexMarker1002"/>activated, re-ordered, and deactivated under Video, in the same way <a id="_idIndexMarker1003"/>as all other video effects. In this chapter, you'll learn how to apply effects, how to animate them, which are the most useful effects, and how to use masks to restrict effects.</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.51: The Effects Browser sits in the lower right of the interface; here, the Distortion category i<span>s selected</span></p>&#13;
			<p>In the sidebar, you'll see <strong class="bold">Video Effects</strong> on top and <strong class="bold">Audio Effects</strong> below. (We will return to Audio Effects <a id="_idIndexMarker1005"/>in the next chapter.) At the top of the menu, you'll see <strong class="bold">All Video</strong> and <strong class="bold">Audio</strong>, and below that, <strong class="bold">Video</strong> then <strong class="bold">All</strong>:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Click <strong class="bold">All</strong>, just under <strong class="bold">Video</strong>, to see all of the video effects in the pane to <span>the right.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Click <strong class="bold">any category name</strong> to see only the video effects in that<span> category.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Video effects can be previewed before being applied to a selected clip:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Hover (skim) over an effect to see that effect applied to the sele<span>cted clip:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.52: Hovering is a good way to preview the effect on the cu<span>rrent clip</span></p>&#13;
			<p>However, as effects can often be extensively customized, remember that you're only seeing a preview of the default setting of an effect here. You can get a slightly more informative preview, though:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Hold <strong class="bold">⌥</strong> as you hover over an effect to change the primary control within th<span>at effect.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Normally <a id="_idIndexMarker1006"/>this "primary control" is the strength of the effect, and it's a useful way to see how an effect will appear with slightly different settings. You can release <strong class="bold">⌥</strong> and skim over the clip to see the new setting applied to the rest of the clip.</p>&#13;
			<p>To apply a video effect to a clip, there are two methods:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Select one or more clips in the timeline, then <em class="italic">double-click an effect</em> to<span> apply it.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><em class="italic">Drag an effect</em> to a clip in the<span> timeline.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Either of these works fine, and you'll be able to see that the clip has changed by skimming over it or playing the video.</p>&#13;
			<p>If you find yourself using a specific effect regularly, you can assign it as the default by right-clicking and choosing <strong class="bold">Make Default Video Effect</strong>. That default effect can be added to a clip with <strong class="bold">⌥E</strong>.</p>&#13;
			<p>Most effects work in real time on most Macs, but some complex effects (especially noise reduction) can be very slow. If your Mac isn't fast enough to play back video effects in real time, you can try the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Switching <a id="_idIndexMarker1007"/>to <strong class="bold">Better Performance</strong> (not <strong class="bold">Better Quality</strong>) from the <strong class="bold">View</strong> menu in t<span>he </span><span><strong class="bold">Viewer</strong></span><span>:</span></li>&#13;

			<p>With <strong class="bold">Background Rendering</strong> active, you'll need to wait for a few seconds for your newly applied effect<a id="_idIndexMarker1008"/> to be calculated, and you'll see small dots in the timeline's ruler bar disappearing as this calculation happens:</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.55: The dots above the ruler are shown before rendering and disap<span>pear after</span></p>&#13;
			<p><strong class="bold">Rendering</strong> is the process<a id="_idIndexMarker1009"/> of creating the final version of your edited video, and once rendered, everything will always play smoothly. Rendering does take time and requires hard drive space to store, so if your Mac is fast enough, you may not need to render in the background at all.</p>&#13;

			</ol>&#13;
			<p>You may wish to turn an effect on and off to see whether it's working, and that's easy:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Click the checkbox next to an effect's name to turn it <span>on or off.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;

			</ul>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">IMPORTANT NOTE</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">Remember <strong class="bold">Adjustment Layers</strong> from the previous chapter? You can apply effects not just to individual<a id="_idIndexMarker1011"/> clips, but to Adjustment Layers too. With an Adjustment Layer above all or some of your timeline, it's easy to apply as many effects as you wish to as many clips as you wish. If you haven't installed a free Adjustment Layer yet, search one out and install it.</p>&#13;
			<p>Awesome, you've got the effect applied and you can see that it worked. It's time to tweak!</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-341"><a id="_idTextAnchor354"/>Adjusting video effects</h2>&#13;
			<p>It's always<a id="_idIndexMarker1012"/> wise to <em class="italic">change an effect's settings from the defaults</em> to make sure that you're not applying exactly the same effect as 90% of other editors. The vast majority of effects and titles are applied unchanged, and if you want to stand out from the crowd, make sure your work is unique — adjust a slider!</p>&#13;
			<p>To change settings, you need to look in the <strong class="bold">Video</strong> tab of the Inspector. There, you'll see that the effect has been added to the clip, and that's where you can control exactly how it works. Let's move through a simple example with a common filter, the <strong class="bold">Gaus</strong><strong class="bold">sian Blur</strong>:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">⌥-click</strong> on a clip to select it and move the playhead to t<span>hat point.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Effects</strong> pane, click on the <strong class="bold">Blur</strong><span> category.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Hover over the <strong class="bold">Gaussian</strong> effect and see the preview effect applied to<span> the clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Hold <strong class="bold">⌥</strong> as you hover over the <strong class="bold">Gaussian</strong> effect to see what Gaussian looks like at different <span>strengths.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Double-click the <strong class="bold">Gaussian</strong> effect to apply it. (Alternatively, drag the effect to <span>the clip.)</span></li>&#13;
				<li>In the Inspector, move<a id="_idIndexMarker1013"/> the <strong class="bold">Amount</strong> slider up and down to see how different strengths look in the Viewer, and reduce the effec<span>t overall:</span><div id="_idContainer579" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_12.56_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.56: Blurry, but not <span>too blurry</span></p><p>This should look much the same as it did earlier when you held <strong class="bold">⌥</strong>.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Change the other settings in the Inspector (<strong class="bold">Horizontal</strong>, <strong class="bold">Vertical</strong>, <strong class="bold">Blur Boost</strong>) to try for a diffe<span>rent look.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>While you might not want to blur out a regular shot, a blur can be a useful way to de-emphasize a background clip behind a title. It can also be a useful effect to animate over time, turning down a blur to bring a shot back into focus. (More on this soon.)</p>&#13;
			<p>Some more complex effects include on-screen controls to allow direct manipulation of the effect in the Viewer. Here's how to use one:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">⌥-click</strong> on the same clip to select it and move the playhead to t<span>hat point.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Effects</strong> pane, click on the <strong class="bold">Tiling</strong><span> category.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Hover over the <strong class="bold">Kaleidoscope</strong> effect and see the preview effect applied to the clip. (Holding <strong class="bold">⌥</strong> doesn't do anyth<span>ing here.)</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Double-click the <strong class="bold">Kaleidoscope</strong> effect to apply it. (Alternatively, drag the effect to <span>the clip.)</span></li>&#13;
				<li>In the Viewer, <em class="italic">move the center control and the two connected handles</em> to adjust the <a id="_idIndexMarker1014"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1015"/>positioning of the effect and the two angles by which the Kaleidoscope is <span>generated:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer580" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_12.57_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.57: This effect is terrific, but it's tough to convince corporate clients<span> to use it</span></p>&#13;
			<p>With the on-screen controls in the Viewer, the Inspector is less important, though it can still be helpful. For consistency across multiple clips, the Inspector allows you to repeat specific values or adjust position in only one dimension while dragging an on-screen control is less precise. And with more complex effects, not every property is exposed through an on-screen display; indeed, the <strong class="bold">Mix</strong> control on this effect is only visible in the Inspector. </p>&#13;
			<p>With two effects applied to the same clip, you'll find that order is often important: effects are applied from the top down. This order can be changed, by dragging any effect up or down in the stacking order. It's subtle here, but if you drag Gaussian to second in the list, it will remove some of the Kaleidoscope's finer details.</p>&#13;
			<p>Finally, note that you'll only see the on-screen controls if the effect is selected (with a yellow outline) in the Inspector. This is always the case when an effect has just been applied, but if you've added a few effects to a single clip, only one set of on-screen controls can be active.</p>&#13;
			<p>Now while<a id="_idIndexMarker1016"/> the Kaleidoscope effect is very cool, it's hardly something you'd use every day. Abstract art can be wonderful in the right place, but most corporate videos are not that place. So, what are the most useful effects that you should know about? I'm glad you asked.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-342"><a id="_idTextAnchor355"/>The most useful video effects</h2>&#13;
			<p>In this quick section, I'll move<a id="_idIndexMarker1017"/> through the built-in categories, pointing out some of the most useful individual effects. There are many effects not listed here that are still great, though.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-343"><a id="_idTextAnchor356"/>Basics</h3>&#13;
			<p>This is a handy<a id="_idIndexMarker1018"/> collection of common effects that didn't find a home elsewhere:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Noise Reduction</strong> is an effective way to clean up noisy shots, but (like all noise reduction) it can be a li<span>ttle slow.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Negative</strong> is a quick way to invert black and white in y<span>our image.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Threshold</strong> reduces the number of colors in your image, but there are dedicated comic effects elsewhere if that's <span>your goal.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Timecode</strong> is a vital tool for a more complex post-production pipeline, displaying the timecode of the source clip or the Project on the cl<span>ip itself:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer581" class="figure">&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.58: Timecode for a source clip or Project — you'll know if you<span> need this</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Several other effects in this category adjust color and contrast, but you may prefer to use the color <a id="_idIndexMarker1019"/>correction tools (such as Color Curves) for more control.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-344"><a id="_idTextAnchor357"/>Blur</h3>&#13;
			<p>These are tools to <a id="_idIndexMarker1020"/>make things softer or (oddly) sharper:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Defocus</strong> is a blur that resembles real-world camera blur, but it's slower than the simpler <strong class="bold">Gaussi</strong><span><strong class="bold">an</strong></span><span> option:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.59: Defocus looks a little nicer than Gaussian, but is it worth the time?<span> Your call</span></p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Focus</strong> blurs the edges of the frame while a center area remains in focus. Tweak the<span> settings!</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Directional</strong>, <strong class="bold">Radial</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Zoom</strong> are all different kinds of blur that suggest<span> movement.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Prism</strong> offsets the color channels for a nice color distorti<span>on effect:</span></li>&#13;

			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Sharpen</strong> lets you<a id="_idIndexMarker1021"/> improve the clarity of a clip, but be careful not to overdo it. It's OK on defaults, but this is one case where dragging on the numbers doesn't give as much control as the slider. Note that an alternative strategy for sharpening, the Unsharp Mask, is in Motion and is available as a free third-party FCP X effect (search online for "unsharp mask fcp<span> x free").</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-345"><a id="_idTextAnchor358"/>Color</h3>&#13;
			<p>Several effects here <a id="_idIndexMarker1022"/>are either the actual color corrections available in the <strong class="bold">Color</strong> tab or perform similar functions. The other effects in this category include:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Black &amp; White</strong>, <strong class="bold">Colorize</strong>, <strong class="bold">Sepia</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Tint</strong> give slightly different ways to remove color, optionally tinting t<span>he result.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Broadcast Safe</strong> can limit the range of colors to broadcast-approved values. Adding this to an Adjustment Layer that covers your entire timeline is a quick way to make sure all your video levels are within val<span>id ranges.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Custom LUT</strong> allows you to add a pre-made color transform, a <strong class="bold">Look-Up Table</strong>, to your clip. This could be an aesthetic combination of very specific color and contrast changes, a mechanical conversion from Log-style shooting to a more normal range, or something else. LUTs are widely available for free and for purchase, and this effect lets you apply them. As you add LUTs with <strong class="bold">Choose Custom LUT</strong> from the menu, they'll be remembered in the menu for future application, and<a id="_idIndexMarker1023"/> source and target color spaces can be adjusted<span> here too:</span></li>&#13;

			<p class="callout-heading">IMPORTANT NOTE</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">A quick sidestep on LUTs here to address a minor issue. While you can use the Custom LUT effect to apply either a mechanical or an aesthetic LUT, there's another way to apply a Log conversion, and footage from some cameras will have this conversion applied automatically. To find it, look in the <strong class="bold">Info</strong> tab in the Inspector, under the Settings metadata view, and find Camera LUT. This affects a clip throughout a Library, is applied before any other corrections, and sometimes, can cause clipping in highlights or shadows. Turn Camera LUT to off if it's causing problems, and you can still correct Log footage using the normal color correction workflow shown in <a href="B15343_11_PreFinal_Apple_SK+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor296"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, <em class="italic">Play with Light: Color Correction and Grading</em>.</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">HDR Tools</strong> lets you convert HDR footage into Rec. 709 color space and vice versa. If you've been given footage that seems brighter than you expected, it could be HLG, and<a id="_idIndexMarker1024"/> this effect can r<span>escue it. </span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-346"><a id="_idTextAnchor359"/>Comic Looks</h3>&#13;
			<p>All of these effects <a id="_idIndexMarker1025"/>are awesome if you want to make your footage<a id="_idIndexMarker1026"/> look like a comic, but not very useful if you don't. As ever, tweak the settings:</p>&#13;

			<h3 id="_idParaDest-347"><a id="_idTextAnchor360"/>Distortion</h3>&#13;
			<p>While most of<a id="_idIndexMarker1027"/> these effects are terrific for special occasions, they're very noticeable and not in the least subtle. There are some standouts, though:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Crop and Feather</strong> is great when you want to trim a clip but apply soft edges or roun<span>d corners.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Flipped</strong> lets you horizontally (flip) or vertically (flop) reflect your shot because sometimes you just want things going the other way. Beware of words<span> and cars.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Trails</strong> adds echoes in time and works really well with fast-movin<span>g objects.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Underwater</strong> gives you the classic <span>wavy look.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Water Pane</strong> really does make a clip look like it's behind glass in<span> the rain:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer586" class="figure">&#13;

			<h3 id="_idParaDest-348"><a id="_idTextAnchor361"/>Keying</h3>&#13;
			<p><strong class="bold">Keyer</strong> removes a<a id="_idIndexMarker1028"/> color from the shot (usually green, but sometimes blue) and it's a critical part of the workflow for many kinds of productions. If you want to shoot against a green screen, get it right in production (light both subject and screen, and be sure to separate them to avoid green spill on your subject) and this effect will work well. Once you've applied a Keyer to a clip, you'll see through (where the green was) to other clips behind, and it's a good idea to have the final background clip in position underneath this clip before you tweak the settings much further:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer587" class="figure">&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.64: You'll need to position your background elements underneath the green screen clip (Credit: Sma<span>rt Pointe)</span></p>&#13;
			<p>There are many, many<a id="_idIndexMarker1029"/> settings to tweak to isolate a subject from a green background, but every shot will need its own adjustments. Move from top to bottom, selecting the <strong class="bold">Sample Color</strong>, finessing the <strong class="bold">Edges</strong>, then trying the other main settings (<strong class="bold">Fill Holes</strong>, <strong class="bold">Edge Distance</strong>, <strong class="bold">Spill Level</strong>) before finessing the color selection, matte, spill suppression, and light wrap in their dedicated sections. With a clean shot, hopefully, you won't need to do much:</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.65: So many settings — it'll take a while to understand them all (Credit: Sma<span>rt Pointe)</span></p>&#13;
			<p><strong class="bold">Luma Keyer</strong> is simpler because it removes part of the image based on its brightness and has fewer <a id="_idIndexMarker1030"/>controls. However, it's exactly the right tool to remove the lighter or darker part of an image. If you can shoot an object against a pure white background, this lets you remove that background pretty easily:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer589" class="figure">&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.66: On the left is the original clip; on the right, the darker areas have been removed with <span>Luma Keyer</span></p>&#13;
			<p>With either of these keyer operations, the effect is best used to separate the subject from its background, and you might not be able to clean up the very edges of the frame while keeping the subject well isolated. For that, use a <strong class="bold">Draw Mask</strong> effect (to be discussed soon) to exclude the edges.</p>&#13;
			<p>Lastly, if you need to adjust both the subject and the background together, you'll need to combine them into <a id="_idIndexMarker1031"/>a compound clip or use an Adjustment Layer above both clips.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-349"><a id="_idTextAnchor362"/>Light</h3>&#13;
			<p>Sparkly things <a id="_idIndexMarker1032"/>always grab attention:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;

			<p>This important <a id="_idIndexMarker1035"/>category lets you control which part of a clip is visible, allowing you to blend one clip with another based on a shape or a gradient, rather than the content of that clip like the Keying category does. These control <em class="italic">clip visibility</em> and shouldn't be confused with the regular Shape Masks or Color Masks that control <em class="italic">color or effect v</em><em class="italic">isibility</em>:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Draw Mask</strong> lets you click to create polygonal lines, or click and drag to create curved lines, to create any kind of shape. The shape can become quite complex, as you can double-click on the edge to create new points then move them around. Selected points can be deleted, and handles can be set to Linear or Smooth, then dragged to affect the curve using industry-standard bézier shape controls. You can use this to cut around a simple outline, or in combination with keying effects as a <em class="italic">garbage matte</em>, to clean up the edges of a green screenshot. To use a complex mask to control a color correction or other effect, duplicate a clip above itself, then apply the color correction or effect to the top clip and add a Draw M<span>ask to it:</span></li>&#13;

			</ul>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-355"><a id="_idTextAnchor368"/>Third-party effects</h3>&#13;
			<p>There are<a id="_idIndexMarker1042"/> thousands more effects to explore, both free and paid, from many third-party effects providers. Some of these can enable entirely new workflows by providing object tracking or advanced keying, but they go beyond the scope of this book.</p>&#13;
			<p>It's time to get moving, with a few examples of how to animate effect properties.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-356"><a id="_idTextAnchor369"/>Animating video effects</h2>&#13;
			<p>The keyframing <a id="_idIndexMarker1043"/>system works just as well on Effects as it does on any other property accessible in the Inspector, and here, you'll see a couple of examples of how to use it well. A quick way to find out whether an effect will look good when animated is to move one of its sliders up and down, then see whether you like the effect. The process should feel familiar:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">⌥-click</strong> on a clip, two seconds from its start point, to select it and move the playhead to that poin<span>t in time.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Choose the <strong class="bold">Blur</strong> category, then drag <strong class="bold">Gaussian</strong> to the clip (or double-click <span><strong class="bold">Gaussian</strong></span><span>).</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Set <strong class="bold">Amount</strong> to zero, to deactivate t<span>he effect.</span><p>As before, we will lock in the second keyframe first, at the <em class="italic">end</em> of the animation. </p></li>&#13;
				<li>In the Inspector, to the right of the <strong class="bold">Amount</strong> property in the <strong class="bold">Gaussian</strong> section, press the <strong class="bold">+</strong> inside the diamond to create a new<span> keyframe.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">↑</strong> to move the playhead back to the start of the cur<span>rent clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Increase <strong class="bold">Amount</strong> to a large value, <strong class="source-inline">5</strong><span><strong class="source-inline">0</strong></span><span> or more.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Play through this clip to see the image come i<span>nto focus:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer597" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_12.74_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.74: Playing through the clip, the animation will reduce the blur from a high <span>value to 0</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Note that if the image remains somewhat blurry while Amount is set to zero, you may need to choose <strong class="bold">Higher Quality</strong> from the <strong class="bold">View</strong> menu in the Viewer. <strong class="bold">Better Performance</strong> reduces resolution to optimize performance, and this looks like a blur.</p>&#13;
			<p>This isn't a<a id="_idIndexMarker1044"/> real "focus pull" because the image all comes into focus at the same time and because a Gaussian Blur doesn't try to emulate a real camera. The <strong class="bold">Defocus</strong> effect tries harder but is much slower, and you'll need to Render before playing it back. If Background Rendering is enabled, just wait a few seconds for the render to happen, but if not, press <strong class="bold">⌃R</strong> to render just this clip.</p>&#13;
			<p>Another good example is <strong class="bold">Censor</strong>, which you can use to pixellate someone's face as they move around:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">⌥-click</strong> on a clip of a person to select it and move the playhead to that poin<span>t in time.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Choose the <strong class="bold">Stylize</strong> category, then drag <strong class="bold">Censor</strong> to the clip (or double-clic<span>k </span><span><strong class="bold">Censor</strong></span><span>).</span><p>This time, we'll keyframe all the way along, from the start.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">↑</strong> to move the playhead back to the start of the cur<span>rent clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Change the <strong class="bold">Amount</strong>, <strong class="bold">Radius</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Center</strong> to position the circle over a pers<span>on's face:</span><div id="_idContainer598" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_12.75_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.75: Disguise that person, <span>on frame 1</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong>, to the right of the <strong class="bold">Center</strong> property in the <strong class="bold">Censor</strong> section, press the <strong class="bold">+</strong> inside the diamond to create a new<span> keyframe.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">⇧→</strong> to move <a id="_idIndexMarker1045"/>10 frames down the<span> timeline.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Use the on-screen controls to move the effect’s Center to remain on the person’s face. If they haven’t moved far, still make a tiny nudge to place a new<span> keyframe.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Repeat</strong> until keyframes have been placed along the full length of<span> the clip:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer599" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_12.76_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.76: Different positions all of the way down the timeline should look like this in Video<span> Animation</span></p>&#13;
			<p>If you find that there's very little movement, you can move a greater distance between keyframes to save time. When protecting identity like this, play through to make sure that you have obscured a face completely and add new keyframes to cover sudden movements.</p>&#13;
			<p>Here are a few ideas for further animation:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Stylize</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Photo Recall</strong>, animate <strong class="bold">Amount</strong> from <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">100</strong> to turn a clip int<span>o a photo.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Distortion</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Wave</strong>, animate <strong class="bold">Amount</strong> and <strong class="bold">Offset</strong> to produce a classic sci-fi teleport<span>er effect.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Blur</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Prism</strong>, animate <strong class="bold">Amount</strong> up and then down, in time with the beat, for a quick distort<span>ion punch.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Light</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Dazzle</strong>, animate <strong class="bold">Brightness</strong> or <strong class="bold">Threshold</strong> to create subtle or strong flashing ligh<span>t effects.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>To finesse keyframes <a id="_idIndexMarker1046"/>over time, you can use the keyframe jumping and creation controls in the Inspector, as well as the positioning controls in Video Animation. There, you'll see a new line for each effect on a clip, and a keyframe graph (as seen in Opacity) can be activated for any property that has a range from <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">100</strong>. The graph can be shown by choosing the appropriate effect property and then clicking the icon to the right of the property. Common examples include <strong class="bold">Opacity</strong>, <strong class="bold">Amount</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Mix</strong>, all good ways to animate an effect on or off:</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.77: These complex curves pulse the Dazzle in time wit<span>h the beat</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Adding animation <a id="_idIndexMarker1047"/>to a video effect lets you vary it over time, but you can do more. With masking, you can vary them in space too, and that's next.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-357"><a id="_idTextAnchor370"/>Masking video effects</h2>&#13;
			<p>The process of <a id="_idIndexMarker1048"/>masking a video effect is almost exactly the same as masking a color correction, with a similar outcome: an effect is limited to only part of the frame. A shape mask limits the effect to a particular part of the frame, while a color mask would limit the effect to particular colors or brightness values.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">IMPORTANT NOTE</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">Masking applied to a video effect is not the same as the category of video effects called <strong class="bold">Masks</strong>. Those effects (<strong class="bold">Draw Mask</strong>, <strong class="bold">Graduated Mask</strong>, and so on) govern visibility for an entire clip. Masking applied to an effect just changes which parts of a clip are changed by an effect.</p>&#13;
			<p>Here's an abbreviated series of steps:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Apply an effect to a clip<span> as usual.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Hover over the effect's title bar, then click the Mask icon and choose <strong class="bold">Add S</strong><span><strong class="bold">hape Mask</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Reposition</strong>, <strong class="bold">reshape</strong>, <strong class="bold">resize</strong>, and <strong class="bold">rotate</strong> the mask <span>as needed:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer601" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_12.78_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.78: Here's a shape mask applied to a G<span>low effect</span></p>&#13;
			<p>While the effect will <a id="_idIndexMarker1049"/>now be limited to the inside of the mask, the menu allows you to Invert the mask to affect the outside instead. Masks are shown immediately underneath the effect to which they are applied, and a menu to the right of the mask's name allows you to Reset or Delete the mask.</p>&#13;
			<p>Here are a few examples of when masking can be useful:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Sharpen</strong> to focus attention on t<span>he subject</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Blur</strong> to de-emphasize the <span>background</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Comic Looks</strong> to turn only part of the image into<span> a cartoon</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">A color correction vignette</strong> to darken the extreme corners of<span> the frame</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Underwater</strong> or <strong class="bold">Wave</strong>, limited to water, to add ripp<span>les to it:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer602" class="figure">&#13;

			<p>Depending on what you're trying to do, the shots you're working with, and the effects you're trying to <a id="_idIndexMarker1050"/>apply, this can work well or fail badly. There's always more than one way to get the job done, so if it doesn't work the first way, try another.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-358"><a id="_idTextAnchor371"/>Create and use Effects Presets</h2>&#13;
			<p><strong class="bold">Effects Presets</strong><strong class="bold"><a id="_idIndexMarker1051"/></strong> combine one or more effects or color <a id="_idIndexMarker1052"/>corrections into a single, reusable <a id="_idIndexMarker1053"/>effect, like<a id="_idIndexMarker1054"/> a pre-copied set of effects ready to be pasted to as many clips as you like — and a few are pre-installed. If you look in the <strong class="bold">Basics</strong> category of effects, you'll see several <strong class="bold">Vintage</strong> effects that make your image look old and fashionable. These are actually Effects Presets, which combine an <strong class="bold">Add Noise</strong> effect with a couple of color corrections:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.80: When Vintage – Soft Green is applied, multiple effects<span> are added</span></p>&#13;
			<p>To extend this example, if you're a fan of a particular color look, you might want to reuse it in different projects, and an Effects Preset would be a great way to maintain consistency. Effects Presets are most likely to be useful for corrections that create something distinctive, such as a vignette or a complex vintage look, and are straightforward to use. Here's an example using a single color correction (though you could combine more):</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">⌥-click</strong> on a clip to select it and move the playhead to t<span>hat point.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">⌘6</strong> to add the default color correction to <span>this clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Darken the exposure quite<span> strongly.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>At the <a id="_idIndexMarker1055"/>top of the <strong class="bold">Color</strong> pane, use the <strong class="bold">Masks</strong> menu<a id="_idIndexMarker1056"/> to create<a id="_idIndexMarker1057"/> a new S<span>hape </span><span><a id="_idIndexMarker1058"/></span><span>Mask.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Resize the mask into a large oval with a <span>soft edge.</span></li>&#13;

				<li>In the field<a id="_idIndexMarker1059"/> at <a id="_idIndexMarker1060"/>the <a id="_idIndexMarker1061"/>top, type a new name for this<a id="_idIndexMarker1062"/> effect such as <em class="italic">Darken V</em><span><em class="italic">ignette 1</em></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>From the <strong class="bold">Category</strong> menu, choose <strong class="bold">Color Presets</strong> if it's present. (If it's not there, choose <strong class="bold">New Category</strong> from the end of the list and c<span>reate it.)</span><p>When you're done, you'll find your new <strong class="bold">Effects Preset</strong> in the <strong class="bold">Effects</strong> pane, in the category you saved it in, ready to preview with a hover. Feel free to experiment further by combining a few video effects together into a single <strong class="bold">Effects Preset</strong>, perhaps:</p><ul><li><strong class="bold">Raindrops</strong> plus <strong class="bold">Rain</strong>, to really add t<span>he weather</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Film Noir</strong>, <strong class="bold">Projector</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Letterbox</strong>, for an extreme "<span>film" look</span></li><li>Several color corrections that you want to us<span>e together</span></li><li>Any effect with customizable settings, tuned to your pr<span>eferences </span></li></ul></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>After applying an Effects Preset, all controls are fully accessible, just as if you'd performed a<a id="_idIndexMarker1063"/> Paste Effects after a Copy. This is great for <a id="_idIndexMarker1064"/>flexibility, but you won't be able to <a id="_idIndexMarker1065"/>turn <a id="_idIndexMarker1066"/>multiple effects down together.</p>&#13;
			<p>Phew. It's time for a quick look back.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-359"><a id="_idTextAnchor372"/>Review — Applying and using video effects</h2>&#13;
			<p>Video effects<a id="_idIndexMarker1067"/> fall into two categories: those you notice and those you <a id="_idIndexMarker1068"/>don't. While you're learning, it's easiest to work with the more obvious effects, to experiment with the settings, masking, and animation in a really obvious way. In this section, you've learned how to do all of that, and there are so many effects that it's worth spending time getting to know your options. But once you've got a handle on how to use everything here, try applying effects in more subtle ways, to enhance shots rather than changing them utterly. Anyone can add a LUT, but only an expert knows how to make that effect (with added noise and vignette) on their own.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-360"><a id="_idTextAnchor373"/><a id="_idTextAnchor374"/>Summary</h1>&#13;
			<p>This has been another monster chapter, but there was a lot of ground to cover.</p>&#13;
			<p>It's your job to make the edit look good as it's not always possible to get everything right on set. If the cinematographer is a farmer who provides the ingredients, you're the chef who assembles them into a meal. Video properties are how you cut and present those ingredients, showing only the best parts, and turning imperfect shots into perfect ones. Video effects are your salt, pepper, and spices, helping each shot to shine, while animation… actually, the metaphor breaks down a little here.</p>&#13;
			<p>Animation can let you add life where the shots couldn't, and it injects not just movement, but interest.</p>&#13;
			<p>To return to the metaphor: get cooking, and make the best of what you have. In the next chapter, you'll find out how to move between clips with transitions and how to manipulate time with speed changes.</p>&#13;
