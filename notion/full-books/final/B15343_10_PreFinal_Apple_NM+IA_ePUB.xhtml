			<p class="author-quote-source">— Bill Davis, 30-year editor, narrator, and producer, Southern California</p>&#13;
			<p>Feeling confident? With everything you've done so far, you're able to import and organize your shots, create a new Project, add clips to it, remove parts of those clips, connect new ones above, trim, Roll, Slip, and Slide the right parts of clips into the right places, and replace one shot for another in many sneaky ways, and you know about Multicam too. After this chapter, you'll also be able to wrap up parts of your Project for reuse elsewhere, navigate around your timeline, create gaps as you edit, move clips vertically without the mouse, and more — all the weird little things that you'll use now and again, but that you might not use too often. These "good to know" topics include the following:</p>&#13;

				<li>Using the Time<span>line Index</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>To begin, you'll learn about Compound Clips and other containers.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-262"><a id="_idTextAnchor272"/>Creating and using Compound Clips</h1>&#13;
			<p>Compound Clips <a id="_idIndexMarker616"/>let you group several clips and treat them just like a single clip within a Project. Like Multicam Clips, Compound Clips are containers, and <a id="_idIndexMarker617"/>as you'll see soon, containers enable advanced replacement workflows. But a Compound Clip isn't limited to a single angle; it can contain anything a Project can, including any number of simultaneous or sequential clips.</p>&#13;
			<p>For example, if several icons were positioned at the same time in a Project, all as independent, connected clips, they could be selected and converted into a single Compound Clip, then moved, modified, and trimmed as a single unit. Similarly, you could combine a green-screen clip and its separate background clip into a single Compound Clip. The process is easy:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li>Select one or many clips, either in the Timeline or in the Browser. They can be connected or sequential; any group of clip<span>s will do:</span><div id="_idContainer362" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_10.1_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.1: Here's a background, then a custom generator above, then a logo, th<span>en a title</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Go to <strong class="bold">File</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">New</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Compound Clip</strong> (<strong class="bold">⌥</strong><strong class="bold">G</strong>) and type a name in the pane tha<span>t appears:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer363" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_10.2_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.2: Give your new Compound C<span>lip a name</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Giving Compound Clips sensible names is something you'll appreciate later:</p>&#13;

				</div>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.3: Once wrapped up, the display in the timeline becomes mu<span>ch simpler</span></p>&#13;
			<p>No matter how the clips are initially selected, you'll create a new Compound Clip in the Browser, and if clips in a Timeline were selected, they will now be replaced by the new Compound Clip. You can open a Compound Clip, from the Browser or the Timeline, by double-clicking <a id="_idIndexMarker618"/>on it. Inside, you'll see either the structure you converted from the Timeline or the <a id="_idIndexMarker619"/>clips you selected in the Browser in sequence:</p>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.4: The contents of the Compound Clip can be seen with a quick double-click; step back when y<span>ou're done</span></p>&#13;
			<p>You'll see that a Compound Clip is isolated: when you enter one, only its contents are shown. To see the context of its parent timeline, step back by clicking on the arrow to the left of the Compound Clip name in the center of the screen.</p>&#13;
			<p>If you really need to see the contents of that Compound Clip within its parent timeline, you can break the Compound Clip apart, with <strong class="bold">Clip</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Break Apart Clip Items</strong>. Be aware that the link between the two is lost, and you'll also lose any effects applied to the Compound Clip when you do this. If you want to use a Compound Clip after the <strong class="bold">Break Apart</strong> operation, look in the <strong class="bold">Browser</strong>, where you'll find a copy of the Compound Clip in the same Event as your current Project:</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.5: Compound Clips can be broken apart, but this isn't usually<span> necessary</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The use of Compound Clips is known as "nesting" in other <a id="_idIndexMarker620"/>editing applications, and you'd do it for a few reasons:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>To easily reuse complex sequences as a s<span>ingle clip</span><p>This is especially relevant when constructing titles from separate components. For example, if you were to build-up a multi-layer stack of backgrounds, images, and titles to <a id="_idIndexMarker621"/>create an animated introduction page for your video, it's a good idea to convert that <a id="_idIndexMarker622"/>stack into a Compound Clip. You'll find it far easier to reuse it, and it'll be better protected from accidental editing.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>To apply a single video or audio effect to many cli<span>ps at once</span><p>Video and audio effects are covered in the next part of the book, but you'll see that you often get different results applying an effect to a Compound Clip than you do when applying the same effect on several individual source elements. One good example: applying the <strong class="bold">Broadcast Safe</strong> effect to an entire timeline at once is a good way to make sure the effect applies to every clip, after every other effect.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>To transition between many ite<span>ms at once</span><p>Again, transitions are coming soon, but fading five separate items at once doesn't look quite the same as fading out a Compound Clip containing those five items. It often makes sense to combine several clips into a single Compound Clip, and then add the transition to that single item:</p></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;

				<div id="_idContainer367" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_10.6_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.6: Here, a green-screen clip plus several background elements could be combined into a single Compound Clip to simplify and make transiti<span>ons easier</span></p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>To <a id="_idIndexMarker623"/>simplify the appearance <a id="_idIndexMarker624"/>of a comple<span>x timeline</span><p>Sometimes, things are just messy, and hiding complexity makes life easier. Compound Clips can contain any number of clips, while appearing to be a single clip, and take up the vertical space of just a single clip too.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>To edit audio for an entire Proje<span>ct at once</span><p>This will be revisited in <a href="B15343_14_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor404"><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em></a>, <em class="italic">Boost the Signal: Audio Sweetening</em>, but the combination of Compound Clips and Roles enables a powerful audio output workflow.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>To convert a sequence of still images in<span>to a video</span><p>Have lots of images to run sequentially? Easy. Import an image sequence into FCP X, select all the frames at once in the Browser, then press <strong class="bold">⌥G</strong> to create a Compound Clip, and name it:</p></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.7: These still frames can all be selected and combined into a single Com<span>pound Clip</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Double-click <a id="_idIndexMarker625"/>to edit it, press <strong class="bold">⌘A</strong> to <strong class="bold">Select All</strong>, <strong class="bold">⌃D</strong> to change <a id="_idIndexMarker626"/>the <strong class="bold">Duration</strong>, then <strong class="bold">1</strong> and <strong class="bold">return</strong> to make every image take exactly one frame:</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.8: Many images, one <span>frame each</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Now, you can use that Compound Clip in a regular Project and it'll play just like a video clip — just beware of poor performance. If you've used more than a handful of clips, or the images are large, then the safest option is to share the Compound Clip to a Master File QuickTime Movie, then reimport it and replace the Compound Clip in your Project. There's more on the export process in <a href="B15343_16_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor491"><em class="italic">Chapter 16</em></a>, <em class="italic">You're Done: Exporting Your Edit and Finishing Up</em>.</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>To treat a clip of variable duration as a fixe<span>d duration</span><p>Titles are coming up in <a href="B15343_15_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor446"><em class="italic">Chapter 15</em></a>, <em class="italic">A Few Words: Titles and Generators</em>, but you'll discover that most titles will span whatever duration you want them to. To fix a title at a certain duration, to allow you to pause, slow down, and speed up a title, you'll need to wrap it up in a Compound Clip first. More on that later:</p></li>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.9: Here's a Compound Clip with Hold Frames added to allo<span>w retiming</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Here's <a id="_idIndexMarker627"/>one more great reason:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>To automatically update a <a id="_idIndexMarker628"/>clip wherever <span>it is used</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Updating a Compound Clip will update all instances of that Compound Clip, wherever it is used in a Library. This is a great solution when you need to start editing with files that you know are going to change, perhaps the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>An early version of a VF<span>X sequence</span></li>&#13;
				<li>An animated logo that's still being<span> worked on</span></li>&#13;
				<li>A watermarked version of an audio or video clip that will be replaced after<span> licensing</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>While it's entirely possible to simply <strong class="bold">replace</strong> those temp clips with real ones down the line, finding and replacing all those clips could be a lot of work. All you'd need to do instead is this:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Select a clip in th<span>e </span><span><strong class="bold">Browser</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Go to <strong class="bold">File</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">New</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Comp</strong><span><strong class="bold">ound Clip</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>While editing, use that new Compound Clip instead of the orig<span>inal clip:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer371" class="figure">&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.10: In this timeline, "logo CC" has been used t<span>hree times</span></p>&#13;
			<p>If you ever need to change all those Compound Clip instances, you just need to edit the contents of the original Compound Clip. Here are the steps to follow:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Open the <a id="_idIndexMarker629"/>Compound Clip in a timeline by double-cl<span>icking it.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Select your new <a id="_idIndexMarker630"/>source clip in th<span>e </span><span><strong class="bold">Browser</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Replace the contents of the Comp<span>ound Clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Click on the left arrow to the left of the Compound Clip name to step back to you<span>r Project.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Navigate to an instance of the Comp<span>ound Clip:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer372" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_10.11_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.11: All three instances of the logo have changed because the contents of the Compound wer<span>e replaced</span></p>&#13;
			<p>You'll now see that the Compound Clip has been changed to show the new contents, and if the same Compound is used in other Projects, it's been updated there too. But wait: this extends to Multicam containers, which can perform the same trick with some bonus features. </p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-263"><a id="_idTextAnchor273"/>Replacing media using Multicam Clips</h2>&#13;
			<p>If you know or suspect that <a id="_idIndexMarker631"/>a particular clip will be updated, and you need to use it more than once, you could turn it into a Multicam Clip, rather than a Compound Clip, like this:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Select that clip alone in th<span>e </span><span><strong class="bold">Browser</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Go to <strong class="bold">File</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">New</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Mult</strong><span><strong class="bold">icam Clip</strong></span><span>.</span><p>This will create a new Multicam Clip with just a single angle.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Edit using that new Multicam Clip instead of the orig<span>inal clip:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer373" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_10.12_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.12: The same technique, but with a Multicam Clip instead of a Com<span>pound Clip</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Just like a Compound Clip, you can double-click on a Multicam Clip, then change its contents — replacing what's inside for something new — and all the instances of that Multicam Clip will be updated instantly. It's similar to the Compound Clip workflow:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Open the Multicam Clip from a timeline by double-cl<span>icking it.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Select your new source clip in th<span>e </span><span><strong class="bold">Browser</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Replace the contents of the fi<span>rst angle.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Click on the left arrow to the left of the Multicam Clip name to step back to you<span>r Project.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Navigate to an instance of the Mult<span>icam Clip.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>So far, so similar. But why use a Multicam Clip over a Compound Clip? It's all about version control. To compare old and new versions of a clip, you can take advantage of the angles inside a Multicam Clip to keep a previous version of a clip on angle 2 while updating the clip on angle 1. Here's that extended process:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Open the Multicam Clip by double-cl<span>icking it.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>From the <strong class="bold">Angle</strong> menu on the first angle, choose <span><strong class="bold">Add Angle</strong></span><span>:</span><div id="_idContainer374" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_10.13_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.13: The menu next to an angle's name lets you add an e<span>xtra angle</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Hold <strong class="bold">⌥</strong> and drag the contents of the first angle to the second angle to duplicate it there. Make sure to <a id="_idIndexMarker632"/>use <strong class="bold">Snapping</strong> to keep the contents at the same positio<span>n in time.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Select your new source clip in th<span>e </span><span><strong class="bold">Browser</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Replace the contents of the fi<span>rst angle:</span><div id="_idContainer375" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_10.14_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.14: The clip after replacing the contents of <span>the first </span>&#13;
angle and renaming b<span>oth angles</span></p><p>This is key. The current angle will remain active, even if renamed or reordered, so be sure to replace the existing angle, not the newly created second angle.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Click on and rename both angles to match their ne<span>w content.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Return to your Project and navigate to an instance of the Mult<span>icam Clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Switch to <strong class="bold">Angle 2</strong> to see the previous version, or return to <strong class="bold">Angle 1</strong> to see the ne<span>w version:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer376" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_10.15_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.15: All three instances are now updated autom<span>atically, </span>&#13;
but the older version can be se<span>lected too</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Both kinds of containers allow you to reuse a clip and make instant changes throughout a timeline, but each has its own strengths and weaknesses:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Multicam Clips allow extra "version control" flexibility by storing previous options in spare angles, but connected clips aren't allowed within a Multi<span>cam angle.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Compound Clips allow you to connect multiple clips vertically, to store and reuse a more complex <a id="_idIndexMarker633"/>timeline, but there's no easy way to compare previous<span> versions.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>For version control with a more complex multi-level timeline, place Compound Clips within Multic<span>am angles.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Using either of these containers enables advanced replacement workflows, but remember a few limitations:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Compound and Multicam Clips can only be stabilized inside their container, not on th<span>e outside.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Multicam Clips behave slightly differently with regard to Ripple and Roll edits. As discussed previously, the <strong class="bold">Select</strong> tool will perform a <strong class="bold">Roll</strong> edit by default, while the <strong class="bold">Trim</strong> tool can still perform a regular trim edit (<span>a Ripple).</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Containers will not automatically grow to show additional media contained within them, even if the clip at the edge of the container has additio<span>nal media.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>This last point is more obvious with Compound Clips, as they maintain a stricter link to the used part of the clip than Multicam Clips do. When you double-click to enter a Compound, you'll see marked in and out points on the timeline, and since Multicam Clips don't isolate the <a id="_idIndexMarker634"/>used part of the clip in the same explicit way, you might find this confusing. Read on to find out how to extend a Compound Clip.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-264"><a id="_idTextAnchor274"/>Understanding Compound Clip trimming issues</h2>&#13;
			<p>One limitation of <a id="_idIndexMarker635"/>working with Compound Clips is that you can't extend their length to be longer than they started:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer377" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_10.16_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.16: This Compound Clip is 10 seco<span>nds long, </span>&#13;
the default still image length, and can't be m<span>ade longer</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Even if the clips inside the Compound have additional media available — and still images can be as long as you want — you can't simply trim a Compound Clip's In point to earlier than its original In point, nor can you move its Out point to later than its original Out point. The fix is as follows:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Double-click to enter the Comp<span>ound Clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Select the In point of the first clip and move it to the left, or select the Out point of the last clip and move it to <span>the right:</span><div id="_idContainer378" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_10.17_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.17: The contents of the Compound<span> Clip can </span>&#13;
extend beyond its current "<span>out" point</span></p><p>This creates a "handle" beyond the current edges of the clip, shown with darkened crosshatching.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Click on the arrow to the left of the Compound Clip name in the center bar to return to the paren<span>t Project.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Trim the start or end of the cli<span>p outward:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer379" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_10.18_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.18: Back in the Project, you can now extend the Compound Cl<span>ip further</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Obviously, you can avoid this situation by not turning a clip into a Compound until you're sure you won't need <a id="_idIndexMarker636"/>to trim it, or by turning the entire source clip into a Compound and then trimming it within the main timeline.</p>&#13;
			<p>With the trimming issues covered, you just need to keep a few duplication issues in mind, because duplicating a Project doesn't necessarily create duplicates of containers within that Project.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-265"><a id="_idTextAnchor275"/>Understanding container duplication issues</h2>&#13;
			<p>If you make heavy use <a id="_idIndexMarker637"/>of Compound Clips or Multicam Clips, you'll want to be aware of a difference between the two options for duplicating Projects: <strong class="bold">Duplicate Project</strong> and <strong class="bold">Snapsho</strong><strong class="bold">t Project</strong>.</p>&#13;
			<p>If you use <strong class="bold">Duplicate Project</strong>, then that's all that happens — the same Compound and Multicam Clips are used in both copies of the Project. Because any changes inside a Compound or Multicam Clip do ripple through all Projects, if you make changes to a Compound Clip used in a later version of a Project, they will flow through to the same Compound Clip used in an earlier version of a Project. Sometimes this won't matter, but if you need to be able to return to exactly the same version of a timeline that you had previously, it's a potential problem:</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.19: Duplicate as a snapshot to protect Compounds and <span>Multicams </span></p>&#13;
			<p>To combat this, if you use <strong class="bold">Snapshot Project</strong>, any Compound and Multicam Clips used in that Project are also duplicated. This means that each snapshot is fully self-contained; future changes inside those containers will not affect the earlier timelines, and you can revert safely if you need to. However, these duplicates can also cause your Library to become bloated over time. Is it <a id="_idIndexMarker638"/>worth it? That's entirely up to you. I don't personally use snapshots a whole lot, but then again, I don't often need to access pristine versions of my older timelines.</p>&#13;
			<p>Another way to duplicate a Compound Clip is to select a Compound Clip in a timeline, then choose <strong class="bold">Clip</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Reference New Parent Clip</strong>. This command duplicates the Compound Clip in the Browser (adding <strong class="source-inline">copy</strong> to the end of the name) and points the timeline copy to that new duplicate.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-266"><a id="_idTextAnchor276"/>Review — creating and using Compound Clips</h2>&#13;
			<p>Containers such as Compound Clips (and sometimes Multicams) can be a very useful tool in a complex edit, but <a id="_idIndexMarker639"/>they're far more powerful when used early on. If you can predict that you'll need them, they're absolutely worth using. Sometimes, there are a few issues regarding trimming and duplication, but the slightly more complex workflow is worth it.</p>&#13;
			<p>And yet, despite the best forward planning, stuff happens. The next section is all about getting out of those tricky situations.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-267"><a id="_idTextAnchor277"/>Low–level relinking</h1>&#13;
			<p>Many editors don't like to <a id="_idIndexMarker640"/>get down and dirty with the raw media. In fact, the longer you've been in the industry, the more likely you are to have assistant editors to take care of all those details for you. But if you edit videos outside the traditional video and film bubble, you're probably doing it all yourself, and sometimes, circumstances require you to get your hands dirty. </p>&#13;
			<p>Containers (Multicam and Compound Clips) give you flexibility, but using them requires planning upfront: you have to <a id="_idIndexMarker641"/>make the container first, and then edit with it. If you didn't make a container, do you have to manually replace every clip? Not necessarily: you can relink one clip to point at a different source clip if the two files are very similar.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-268"><a id="_idTextAnchor278"/>Relinking to replace a clip</h2>&#13;
			<p>Relinking is a way to replace media behind the scenes, allowing you to point a clip to a different source file. However, this <a id="_idIndexMarker642"/>is only assured to work if the new clip and old clip share the same file type, duration, frame rate, frame resolution, and number of audio channels; if the two files are different, the process can fail:</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.20: You really don't want to see th<span>is warning</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Since relinking can fail in unlucky circumstances, it shouldn't be your primary update mechanism, but if you need it, here it is.</p>&#13;
			<p>Let's say you've been provided with a client's animated transparent logo in a short ProRes 4444 file. You've used this clip several times in a number of Projects, and it looks great:</p>&#13;

			<p>The logo has <a id="_idIndexMarker643"/>just been updated, and you didn't use a container — is that a problem? Maybe not; even without containers, here's a potential quick solution:</p>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.25: Automatically, every instance of the clip will be updated for add<span>ed sparkle</span></p>&#13;
			<p>One thing to be <a id="_idIndexMarker645"/>aware of is that clip names are not updated when using <strong class="bold">Relink Media</strong>. You may wish to rename the source clip's name from <strong class="source-inline">v1</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">v2</strong> just so you're clear what's happened, but that won't change the names of timeline clips.</p>&#13;
			<p>If you do use this trick and your media files are managed by FCP X (inside your Library, or in an external location) remember to follow it up by consolidating your media. To do that, do the following:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Select your <strong class="bold">Library</strong> in the <strong class="bold">Browse</strong><span><strong class="bold">r</strong></span><span> sidebar.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Go to <strong class="bold">File</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Consolidate Library Media</strong>, then tick the relevant boxes and click on <strong class="bold">OK</strong> in the dialog tha<span>t appears:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.26: This step copies the new file into t<span>he Library</span></p>&#13;
			<p>If you don't consolidate, then the relinked file will be pointing at a file outside your Library, and you're opening yourself up to missing media problems down the line. My personal preference is not to <a id="_idIndexMarker646"/>relink media unless there's no other option, but if you're working with external media, relinking is something you might have to do more often. Let's take a look at that too.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-269"><a id="_idTextAnchor279"/>External media and relinking</h2>&#13;
			<p>If you work alone and keep all your files inside the Library (as recommended in <a href="B15343_03_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor084"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Bring It In: Importing Your Footage</em>), then relinking is only rarely necessary. But if your <a id="_idIndexMarker647"/>media is stored externally, and it's not where FCP X expects it to be, you'll have issues. Each icon in the Browser will be the same scary warning symbol in a red box, and nothing will play:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

of your clips o<span>r Projects</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Relink Files</strong> command lets you redirect all the clips in a Library (or an Event, or a single clip) to the correct location, and if you're lucky, it'll go like this:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Click on your Library's top-l<span>evel icon.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Go to <strong class="bold">File</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Relink Files</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Original Media</strong> or<strong class="bold"> File</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Relink Files</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Pr</strong><span><strong class="bold">oxy Media</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>In the dialog that appears, choose <strong class="bold">Missing</strong> at the top, then <strong class="bold">Locate All...</strong>, then find one of the file<span>s on disk:</span></li>&#13;

			<p>All the files will now be <a id="_idIndexMarker648"/>found, angels will sing, and everything will work perfectly forever and ever. Or perhaps you'll have to relink several times, because the media isn't all in one place. Or you have the misfortune to be working with a camera that reuses the same filenames again and again. Or perhaps one file just won't relink at all, for no good reason. From time to time, an error in copying can make a subtle difference in a file, which can cause the relinking process to fail. If that happens, you'll probably have to reimport it and replace it where it was used in your timeline(s), using the techniques discussed in <a href="B15343_09_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor253"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Consider Your Options: Multicam, Replacing, and Auditions</em>. Unpleasant.</p>&#13;
			<p>Relinking is powerful, but also one of the easiest ways to become unstuck. If you're not rigorous with data management, it's very easy to lose a file (or two, or many more) and not to notice that loss until you recover a job from your archive a year or so later. Always consolidate after relinking to make sure your media stays together. Alternatively, if you don't need to collaborate, just use internal media and you'll never lose a file. Collaboration is discussed in <a href="B15343_16_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor491"><em class="italic">Chapter 16</em></a>, <em class="italic">You're Done: Exporting Your Edit and Fin</em><em class="italic">ishing Up</em>.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-270"><a id="_idTextAnchor280"/>Review — low-level relinking</h2>&#13;
			<p>Replacing clips works at a high level, but relinking is a decidedly low-level solution. It can fix a problem you <a id="_idIndexMarker649"/>hopefully won't encounter and enable you to recover from missing media errors. Good to know, even if you don't need it yet.</p>&#13;
			<p>Finally, it's time to look at the last secrets of the tool panel.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-271"><a id="_idTextAnchor281"/>More tricks with tools</h1>&#13;
			<p>This section looks at a couple of commands to move clips up or down in the timeline, as well as <a id="_idIndexMarker650"/>techniques to move around it and change your view, by using tools that haven't been fully explored yet. Although the <strong class="bold">Select</strong> and <strong class="bold">Trim</strong> tools have had <a id="_idIndexMarker651"/>most of the attention, there are other tools that solve some unique problems: </p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer390" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_10.30_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.29: There's no tail on the Position t<span>ool cursor</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Glancing down the <strong class="bold">Tools</strong> pop-up menu, you'll see several options. The <strong class="bold">Blade</strong> tool has some tricks, the <strong class="bold">Zoom</strong> and <strong class="bold">Hand</strong> tools have some minor functions, but really, the <strong class="bold">Position</strong> tool sees the most use. If you've used the Multicam Angle Editor, you may have already used this tool, and as you'll see, it enables all kinds of sneaky tricks. Let's go there first.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-272"><a id="_idTextAnchor282"/>Overriding the Magnetic Timeline with the Position tool</h2>&#13;
			<p>While you should stay with the regular <strong class="bold">Select</strong>, <strong class="bold">Blade</strong>, <strong class="bold">Range Selection</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Trim</strong> tools for most <a id="_idIndexMarker652"/>purposes, the <strong class="bold">Position</strong> tool (<strong class="bold">P</strong>) is dangerous but powerful, and it's what you should reach for <a id="_idIndexMarker653"/>if you find yourself "fighting" with the Magnetic Timeline. To be clear, if you learn to edit "the FCP X way," you're unlikely to feel frustrated.</p>&#13;
			<p>But if you learned to edit in the classic track paradigm, you may want to put a clip way down the timeline, intending to use it later. You might want to move a clip on the Primary Storyline and not affect the positioning of anything else. You might want to drop a clip somewhere and destroy everything underneath. The <strong class="bold">Position</strong> tool does all these things, making FCP X feel like FCP 7, and sometimes, this is very handy indeed.</p>&#13;
			<p>While holding the <strong class="bold">`</strong> (grave) key or <strong class="bold">~</strong> (tilde) key overrides connections and keeps connected clips in their current position, the <strong class="bold">Position</strong> tool keeps clips in storylines in their current positions. With the Position tool active, it's impossible to create a ripple edit, so you might choose to use the Position tool if you've got close to the end of the editing process and can't risk moving anything by accident. If you choose the <strong class="bold">Position</strong> tool and work on storyline clips, the following things become true:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>When you trim a clip to make it longer, you can't move into another clip, because the Position tool can't cause a ri<span>pple edit:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.34: "I really want to use that l<span>ogo later"</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Interestingly, the <strong class="bold">Position</strong> tool doesn't do anything special with connected clips, but behaves exactly like the <strong class="bold">Select</strong> tool. That's because connected clips are already independent, and trimming them doesn't affect anything else.</p>&#13;
			<p>So, when should you use the <strong class="bold">Position</strong> tool? Not too often. If you find yourself reaching for the Position tool all the time, it's likely that you've got some old habits worth breaking. Do you really need to create that huge gap before that last clip, or is it just something you learned long ago? If you don't want to ripple when you edit, the <strong class="bold">Roll</strong> operation on the <strong class="bold">Trim</strong> tool is a better choice. And of course, simply making use of connected clips is a great way to step outside the ripple-friendly embrace of the Magnetic Timeline.</p>&#13;
			<p>One occasion where I've found the <strong class="bold">Position</strong> tool invaluable for is the creation of gaps, especially in secondary storylines. If you've placed a voiceover in a storyline, removing gaps is easy, but inserting them is hard. Yes, you can add a gap clip with <strong class="bold">⌥W</strong>, but that adds it to the Primary Storyline. But there's a way!</p>&#13;
			<p>Let's first recap how you might replace unwanted audio with a gap in a storyline:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Switch to the <strong class="bold">Range Selection</strong> tool (<strong class="bold">R</strong>) and <a id="_idIndexMarker656"/>select a sma<span>ll region:</span><div id="_idContainer396" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_10.36_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.35: The yellow selection is around the breath I want<span> to remove</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">⇧delete</strong> to replace <a id="_idIndexMarker657"/>the selection w<span>ith a gap:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer397" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_10.37_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.36: After the ⇧delete action, you'll see silence a<span>nd a pause</span></p>&#13;
			<p>This strategy works (as does a longer <strong class="bold">Blade</strong>-related method) as long as you have something you want to delete. You can use the regular <strong class="bold">Select</strong> tool (<strong class="bold">A</strong>) to change the length of that gap.</p>&#13;
			<p>However, if you've already removed unwanted parts of the recording, you may have split it into separate clips with no gap between, just butting up against one another (and, of course, this happens all the time with video clips too), So, how do you <em class="italic">create gaps</em> between clips that aren't on the Primary Storyline?</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer398" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_10.38_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.37: Here's a starting position, with <span>two clips </span>&#13;
butted up against o<span>ne another</span></p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Switch to the <strong class="bold">Position</strong> tool (<strong class="bold">P</strong>) and trim the edge of one audio clip to make i<span>t shorter:</span><div id="_idContainer399" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_10.39_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.38: Using the Position tool to adjust the edge of a clip cre<span>ates a gap</span></p><p>This creates a gap clip <a id="_idIndexMarker658"/>that runs for as long as the edit. Nice! And if you didn't actually want to delete that part <a id="_idIndexMarker659"/>of that clip, you can use the <strong class="bold">Select</strong> tool to get it back, as well as to adjust the gap's length.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Switch to the <strong class="bold">Select</strong> tool (<strong class="bold">A</strong>) and trim the audio clip and/or the gap clip to adjust the duration and<span> position:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.39: The Position tool can't adjust a gap clip, but the Selec<span>t tool can</span></p>&#13;
			<p>This same technique (using the <strong class="bold">Position</strong> tool to leave a gap and <strong class="bold">Select</strong> to extend that gap) works nicely on the Primary Storyline when you need your subject to pause a little. As long as there's B-roll on top, you won't see the gap, and as long as there's something audible in the background, you won't hear it either. (This is one reason sound engineers record "room tone," the particular flavor of silence that each &#13;
room offers.):</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer401" class="figure">&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.40: This gap clip on the Primary Storyline is covered visually above and with a<span>udio below</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Position</strong> tool is also <a id="_idIndexMarker660"/>vital inside Multicam Clips, where it's the key to moving clips in time to sync them up with clips on other angles. The <strong class="bold">Position</strong> tool will be selected by default when you jump <a id="_idIndexMarker661"/>inside a Multicam, and it's the one you need.</p>&#13;
			<p>If you had thought of using the <strong class="bold">Position</strong> tool to simplify a timeline vertically, dragging higher clips down to replace parts of the Primary Storyline, instead consider two commands — <strong class="bold">Lift from Storyline</strong> and <strong class="bold">Overwrite to Primary Storyline</strong> — that live in the <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> menu. They can have a similar outcome but offer some clear benefits too.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-273"><a id="_idTextAnchor283"/>Lifting and overwriting</h2>&#13;
			<p>There's another situation where the <strong class="bold">Position</strong> tool might seem like the right choice, and that's if you start with a <a id="_idIndexMarker662"/>clip on the Primary Storyline that you'd like to lift up, or with a connected clip that you'd like to move down to the primary. It's common enough to want to "flatten" a timeline out a bit, but the <strong class="bold">Position</strong> tool is actually the wrong tool for the job, because dragging a connected clip down to the primary will destroy any audio that's already there:</p>&#13;

			<p>Instead, use <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Overwrite to Primary Storyline</strong> (<strong class="bold">⌥⌘↓</strong>), which will retain any audio on the primary clip(s) under the connected clip you're moving down:</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.42: Audio will be expanded if needed, and may be detached if its video component is overwritte<span>n entirely</span></p>&#13;
			<p>It performs this magic trick by expanding the audio on surrounding clips, and even detaching audio from <a id="_idIndexMarker663"/>clips where the video is being entirely overwritten. The result looks and sounds the same as it did before, and although the timeline is now simpler, some editing flexibility is lost. Specifically, you'll have to Slide clips on the Primary Storyline, rather than move a connected clip, and detached audio (if present) might be inconvenient.</p>&#13;
			<p>There's a companion command that does the opposite, <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Lift from Primary Storyl</strong><strong class="bold">ine</strong> (<strong class="bold">⌥⌘↑</strong>):</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.43: Following the previous operation, a Lift creates a connected storyline, but doesn't restore the lost video<span> component</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Similar to dragging a clip up from the primary with the <strong class="bold">Position</strong> tool, a Lift leaves a gap on the Primary Storyline, rather than closing it. This can be useful if you want to play around with a clip (changing its speed or trimming it) without worrying about ripples down the timeline. Speed ramping is a popular effect, and it is covered in <a href="B15343_13_PreFinal_Apple_JM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor378"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></a>, <em class="italic">Blend and Warp: Video Transitions and</em><em class="italic"> Retiming</em>:</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.44: This connected clip started out on the Primary Storyline, but speed ramps are easier to manage in conne<span>cted clips</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Together, these two <a id="_idIndexMarker664"/>commands relieve most problems you might have had because you wanted a clip to be connected, or because you wanted a clip to be part of the Primary Storyline. They're a nice complement to the Position tool.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-274"><a id="_idTextAnchor284"/>Blading multiple clips at once</h2>&#13;
			<p>Now that your <a id="_idIndexMarker665"/>timeline is getting a little more complicated, you <a id="_idIndexMarker666"/>might wonder how to chop up several clips at the same point. Simple: hold <strong class="bold">⇧</strong> as you use the <strong class="bold">Blade</strong> tool, and connected clips at that point in time will also be chopped in two:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer406" class="figure">&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.45: The multi-layer Blade, after<span> a ⇧-click</span></p>&#13;
			<p>You'll probably also remember that <strong class="bold">⌘B</strong> blades the clip under the playhead on the Primary Storyline. This command works with connected clips too, but you'll have to select the secondary clip (or its storyline) before pressing <strong class="bold">⌘</strong><strong class="bold">B</strong>. Finally, to chop up everything at a point in time, press <strong class="bold">⇧⌘B</strong> to blade all the clips under the playhead.</p>&#13;
			<p>One example of when this can be useful is when you want to end a complex storyline with several connected clips. You can use <strong class="bold">⇧⌘B</strong> at the point where you want it all to stop, then select everything past that point and simply press <strong class="bold">delete</strong>.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-275"><a id="_idTextAnchor285"/>Zooming and scrolling with tools</h2>&#13;
			<p>Although <a id="_idIndexMarker667"/>you learned other ways to zoom and pan the timeline earlier, it's worth mentioning that there are <a id="_idIndexMarker668"/>dedicated tools for these functions. At any point, you can press <strong class="bold">Z</strong> to switch to the <strong class="bold">Zoom</strong> tool, and then do one of the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Click</strong> t<span>o zoom in.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">⌥-click</strong> to<span> zoom out.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Drag</strong> over a region to zoom to th<span>at region.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>These functions aren't life-changing, and if you prefer to use the keyboard's plus and minus keys instead, you're not alone. Still, if you've ever pressed <strong class="bold">Z</strong> (the <strong class="bold">Zoom</strong> tool) instead of <strong class="bold">⇧Z</strong> (<strong class="bold">Fit View</strong>) and wondered what happened, now you know:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer407" class="figure">&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.46: Click to zoom in or ⌥-click to zoom out, just like ⌘plus <span>and ⌘minus</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Similarly, pressing <strong class="bold">H</strong> switches to the <strong class="bold">Hand</strong> tool, which lets you click and drag to scroll in any direction:</p>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption"> </p>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.47: Use the Hand tool to grab the timeline and scroll in any direction — i<span>f you like</span></p>&#13;
			<p>If you have a Magic Mouse or Magic Trackpad, you could already swipe sideways to move along the timeline, so this isn't a hugely important tool. While some third-party mice include a sideways scroll <a id="_idIndexMarker669"/>wheel, if you're using a regular mouse without one, you can hold <strong class="bold">⇧</strong> as you use the scroll wheel to move sideways. I think we can safely list the <strong class="bold">Hand</strong> tool as the least essential tool. If you see the hand, you probably pressed <strong class="bold">H</strong> by accident.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-276"><a id="_idTextAnchor286"/>Review — more tricks with tools</h2>&#13;
			<p>Unexciting as the <strong class="bold">Zoom</strong> and <strong class="bold">Hand</strong> tools might be, at least now you know what they all do. The <strong class="bold">Position</strong> tool has definite strengths (even if using it feels risky): blading multiple layers at once is <a id="_idIndexMarker670"/>useful for multi-layered compositions, and lifting and overwriting to or from the Primary Storyline is surprisingly handy from time to time.</p>&#13;
			<p>Time to dive back into Markers: stepping stones you can scatter across not just your clips but also your timelines.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-277"><a id="_idTextAnchor287"/>Adding and navigating with Markers</h1>&#13;
			<p>Way back in <a href="B15343_05_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor141"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Choose Your Favorites: Selecting, Rating, and Searching</em>, we added <a id="_idIndexMarker671"/>Markers to clips in the <strong class="bold">Browser</strong>. They're great in the <strong class="bold">Browser</strong>, but even more <a id="_idIndexMarker672"/>useful when added to clips in the <strong class="bold">Timeline</strong>, where <strong class="bold">Markers</strong> can help you to navigate, to track your progress through a review, and even to provide user navigation in some kinds of exports. In every case, the Marker will be attached to a clip and not a timecode, meaning Markers ripple up and down the timeline as changes are made, and you'll see why that's important in a moment.</p>&#13;
			<p>Let's recap how to add a Marker:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Skim to or click on a clip in the<span> timeline.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">⌥M</strong> to create a Marker and edit its name. (If paused, you could alternatively p<span>ress </span><span><strong class="bold">MM</strong></span><span>.) </span></li>&#13;
				<li>Type a name for the new Marker in the text field tha<span>t appears:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer409" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_10.49_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.48: Markers can be used for all kinds of things, even sim<span>ple praise</span></p>&#13;
			<p>In this context, you can use Markers to note places where you need to add a scene, where you <a id="_idIndexMarker673"/>know you're going to need a title, where sound effects should go, or where the music needs to be <a id="_idIndexMarker674"/>replaced. The standard blue Marker is fine for all these tasks, but there are extra options available. The pop-up text field that lets you name a Marker also includes a switch at the top with three options:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Press the first icon to switch a Marker to a <strong class="bold">Standard Mark</strong><span><strong class="bold">er</strong></span><span> (blue).</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press the second icon to switch a Marker to a <strong class="bold">To Do Mar</strong><span><strong class="bold">ker</strong></span><span> (red).</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press the third icon to switch a Marker to a <strong class="bold">Chapter Marker</strong><span> (orange).</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>The To Do Marker gives you a list of things you haven't done yet, and satisfyingly, a <strong class="bold">Completed</strong> checkbox in the bottom-left corner:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer410" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_10.50_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.49: The red To Do Marker is hard to miss, and can be ticked off<span> when done</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Checking this box not only brings satisfaction from a job well done but also turns the Marker green:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer411" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_10.51_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.50: A green Completed To Do Marker is a ha<span>ppy Marker</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Use these Markers for every change list you're ever given, and you'll be able to show your client exactly where and how you've fulfilled their every request.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">If you want to add a Marker but don't want to give it a name, simply press <strong class="bold">M</strong>. Double-click the Marker to edit the name if you change your mind. The <strong class="bold">Command Editor</strong> allows you to define a shortcut to <strong class="bold">Add ToDo Marker</strong>, but none is assigned by default, and there's no command for <em class="italic">Add and Edit ToDo Marker</em>.</p>&#13;
			<p>To Do Markers <a id="_idIndexMarker675"/>can also solve one of the biggest problems with the old-school list of time-stamped changes: having to <a id="_idIndexMarker676"/>make changes in reverse order. To see why, imagine you're presented with this list of three changes to a 10-minute piece:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>01:30 — trim 5 seconds off the tail of <span>this shot.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>4:45 — start this shot 2 s<span>econds in.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>7:03 — remove <span>this shot.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Tackling those changes from start to finish would mean that the timecodes for the second and third changes now point you to the wrong clips, and you could make a critical mistake. So yes, you could work backward through the list, but why not really impress your client and turn those requests into To Do Markers instead? Because Markers are attached to the top clip under the playhead, they'll be attached to the clip that needs to be edited, and will move backward and forward as earlier edits are made.</p>&#13;
			<p>Another client-impressing feature is that you can jump directly between Markers with a couple of shortcuts:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">⌃semicolon</strong> (<strong class="bold">⌃;</strong>) to jump to the previ<span>ous Marker</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">⌃apostrophe</strong> (<strong class="bold">⌃'</strong>) to jump to the n<span>ext Marker</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Now all you need to do is figure out how to get your clients to use one of those fancy online review sites, rather than sending you a list of timecodes in an email, and you'll be set!</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer412" class="figure">&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.51: Client feedback should be converted into To Do Markers where possible to allow ripple edits <span>to be made</span></p>&#13;
			<p>There are many <a id="_idIndexMarker677"/>sites that allow online review, with varying levels of integration to FCP X, but <a id="_idIndexMarker678"/>check out Frame.io, Vimeo, and/or Postlab if you're keen to improve your client feedback loop.</p>&#13;
			<p>The last type of Marker, the <strong class="bold">Chapter Marker</strong>, is useful only in limited contexts. If you export longer movies to DVD, Blu-ray, or a QuickTime movie that you'll be playing directly on an Apple device, Chapter Markers will be automatically listed in a table of contents that the viewer can jump directly to. But that's it. If you're delivering shorter videos, you won't need these, and if you're delivering to online video sharing sites such as Vimeo or YouTube, they (sadly) don't understand how to read them:</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.52: A Chapter Marker with an offset<span> thumbnail</span></p>&#13;
			<p>In some contexts, the <strong class="bold">Chapter Marker</strong> will be shown with a thumbnail, and this thumbnail can be generated from a different time than the Marker's actual position. Clicking on the orange Marker and moving the orange circle around is all you'll need to do:</p>&#13;

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-278"><a id="_idTextAnchor288"/>Review — adding and navigating with Markers</h2>&#13;
			<p>So far, so good. You know how to add Markers, how to change their names, how to switch between the different <a id="_idIndexMarker681"/>types, and how to tick off a To Do Marker as completed. But right now, you're probably just using shortcuts to jump between them, or searching for them in the Browser. Isn't there a better way? I'm glad you've asked, because there is.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-279"><a id="_idTextAnchor289"/>Using the Timeline Index</h1>&#13;
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Timeline Index</strong> allows you to <a id="_idIndexMarker682"/>view, search, and instantly navigate to everything in your timeline, including Markers, Keywords, clips, Roles, and much more. You can open the <strong class="bold">Timeline Index</strong> by pressing the <strong class="bold">Index</strong> button to the left of the central bar, and you'll then see it pop up to the left of the timeline:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.55: The Timeline Index, showing clips in the curren<span>t timeline</span></p>&#13;
			<p>At the top of this pane, you'll see a <strong class="bold">Search</strong> field, but before you type anything there, it's best to focus on the three words just below it: <strong class="bold">Clips</strong>, <strong class="bold">Tags</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Roles</strong>:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Clips</strong> includes all the items in the timeline, including video, audio, auditions, Multicam, Compound, and gap clips, as well as tr<span>ansitions.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Tags</strong> includes Markers and Keywords of all kinds that are applied to the clips in the<span> timeline.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Roles</strong> shows all the Roles applied to any of the clips in the current timeline, and lets you control visibility and display the order of clips based on th<span>eir Roles.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>One of these can be active at any one time. With Markers fresh in your mind, you should now click on <strong class="bold">Tags</strong> so that you can see them all together, and you'll see a list of all the Keywords and Markers used in your current timeline. Next, glance to the bottom of the pane and click <strong class="bold">All</strong> to make sure you're seeing all the Markers and Keywords.</p>&#13;
			<p>The options to the right of <strong class="bold">All</strong> allow you to limit the display to just one of the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Standa<span>rd Markers</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Keywords</li>&#13;
				<li>Automatically generated Keywords, such as <strong class="bold">Group Shot</strong> an<span>d </span><span><strong class="bold">Close Up</strong></span></li>&#13;
				<li>To Do Markers (that haven't been marked as <strong class="bold">C</strong><span><strong class="bold">ompleted</strong></span><span>) </span></li>&#13;

				<li>Chapt<span>er Markers</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Your client review process just became much simpler. With your To Do Markers all together in a simple list, you can click on one of them and the playhead will jump to it:</p>&#13;

			<p>For larger, more challenging Projects, a client might ask you to fix a specific issue first, and you can search for anything by typing in the <strong class="bold">Search</strong> field. As mentioned, as Markers are attached to clips, it doesn't matter what order you attack your to do list in. Timecodes can date and become incorrect quickly, but Markers won't.</p>&#13;
			<p>Searching is probably most useful when referencing your media, so click on <strong class="bold">Clips</strong> to see a list of all the shots you've <a id="_idIndexMarker684"/>used, in the order you used them. If you know the name of a particular shot, audio sample, or music piece, you can find every instance of it by typing its name, and jump to it in the timeline by clicking on it in the list that appears— great if you need to replace clips that you didn't place in containers. You can also search for any notes you've attached to an entire clip:</p>&#13;

			<p>This is where planning in the organizational stages comes in very handy; if you know you're going to need to find a needle in a haystack later, why not paint that needle bright pink upfront by changing the clip's name or adding a note?</p>&#13;

			<p>Depending on the <a id="_idIndexMarker685"/>kind of production you're working on, you might be using archival media, where you edit with low-resolution watermarked footage and then purchase only what you need for the final product. You might work with footage that's yet to be cleared; you might have to include certain shots or replace certain other shots. The <strong class="bold">Timeline Index</strong> is a great place to find and track all of that, and you just need to add some info in the <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> field or as part of the clip name. But do it early — adding notes to a Browser clip after you've added it to the Timeline won't flow through to that Timeline copy.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">If you need to keep track of a lot of this information, look at applications such as Producer's Best Friend and CommandPost, both of which allow you to export spreadsheet files based on the contents of your timeline.</p>&#13;
			<p>Crucially, you can select clips in the <strong class="bold">Timeline Index</strong> to select them in the timeline, and vice versa. Selecting multiple clips at once works as you'd expect:</p>&#13;

			<p>Selecting clips like this can be a massive timesaver because it means you're relying far less on your eyes and your mouse to select clips. It's also a big help when toggling visibility with <strong class="bold">V</strong>, changing duration with <strong class="bold">⌃</strong><strong class="bold">D</strong>, and nudging clips around with the <strong class="bold">comma</strong> and <strong class="bold">pe</strong><strong class="bold">riod</strong> keys.</p>&#13;
			<p>The last major trick that the <strong class="bold">Timeline Index</strong> enables is the <strong class="bold">Roles</strong> area — click on that now to check it out. Whatever Roles are in use in your timeline are now shown in a list, and a checkbox to the left of each Role lets you disable or enable it:</p>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.61: No Titles, no Dialogue — <span>no problem</span></p>&#13;
			<p>If you want to hear what your timeline sounds like without music, that's simple — just turn the <strong class="bold">Music</strong> Role off. If you've added titles already (coming up in <a href="B15343_15_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor446"><em class="italic">Chapter 15</em></a>, <em class="italic">A Few Words: Titles and Generators</em>), you can disable them easily by turning off the <strong class="bold">Ti</strong><strong class="bold">tles</strong> Role.</p>&#13;
			<p><strong class="bold">Audio Roles</strong> display three additional <a id="_idIndexMarker687"/>buttons on the right-hand side. These buttons allow you to enable or disable the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Audio Lanes</strong> for this Role, meaning that all clips tagged with this Role are gathered together in a named horizontal lane in the<span> timeline.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Subroles </strong>for this Role, allowing you to selectively hear only some of the available Subroles (for example, different speakers could be given Subroles within a Dialo<span>gue Role).</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Focus </strong>on this Role, minimizing all the other Roles to thin lines to allow you to concentrate on only part of<span> the edit:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer423" class="figure">&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.62: Audio Lanes isolates each type of audio vi<span>sually to </span>&#13;
make it easier to see what's<span> happening</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Audio Lanes</strong> function is important enough that you can enable lanes for all Roles at once with a dedicated button at the bottom of the pane: <strong class="bold">Show Audio Lanes</strong>. This feature allows you to visually reorder all the audio clips by dragging the order of the audio Roles in the Timeline Index. For <a id="_idIndexMarker688"/>example, you could bring music to the top and place dialogue just below, without having to manually drag dozens of clips. Audio sounds the same no matter where it's stacked, so put these clips wherever you wish:</p>&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.63: Here, the Music Role has been given focus and reordered <span>to the top</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Lastly, there's another button for <strong class="bold">Edit Roles</strong>, but that's also available by right-clicking on a clip in the <strong class="bold">Browser</strong>, and with <strong class="bold">Modify</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Edit Roles</strong>. Roles are best set up early in the edit process, but better late than never. And, of course, they can be used to add a bit of color to your timeline, even if they don't mean much. Go crazy!</p>&#13;
			<p>The ability to expose Roles and use them to organize and view your entire timeline selectively is a magic feature here. If <a id="_idIndexMarker689"/>you need to export different versions of your timeline, such as a "music and effects" mix (without dialogue or titles, for overseas dubbing), then you'll find it simple. There are more details about that coming up in <a href="B15343_16_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor491"><em class="italic">Chapter 16</em></a>, <em class="italic">You're Done: Exporting Your Edit and Finishing Up</em>, but if you want to hide part of your edit while you work, the Timeline Index is the way to do it.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-280"><a id="_idTextAnchor290"/>Review — using the Timeline Index</h2>&#13;
			<p>The Timeline Index has many uses, and though you're unlikely to use them all on any one job, it's still great. Searching <a id="_idIndexMarker690"/>for names or notes by typing is great, clicking to navigate is great, seeing your to-do list in an actual list is great — it's all gr<a id="_idTextAnchor291"/>eat. But you'll really love it when you use <strong class="bold">Audio Lanes</strong> while editing audio. Something to look forward to.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-281"><a id="_idTextAnchor292"/>Summary</h1>&#13;
			<p>Containers for easy replacement, relinking, tool secrets, and the Timeline Index — wowsers! Planning for change by using containers is a smart idea, but if it's too late, there are still ways to rescue yourself. When a client is over your shoulder and a clip's just not landing where you want it to, the Position tool will get you out of trouble, and the Timeline Index can help you to track down all the copyright-laden clips you know are there but can't find by skimming. These are the controls that avoid disasters, and if you're working with clients for money, you should make them part of your future.</p>&#13;
			<p>This is the end of <em class="italic">Part 2</em>, so now you must know how to edit by now. Right? Maybe, maybe not. Editing is far more of an art than a science, and this book's focus is on learning Final Cut Pro X, not editing. There are many books and online tutorials that can help you grow as an editor, and there are many different ways you could specialize (reality TV, features, vlogs, social media, and so on).</p>&#13;
			<p>While it's true that most of the editing content of the book is now done, the job of an editor has changed over the years, and many clients will now expect you to have at least a passing interest in color correction, the VFX skills to blur out someone's face, a sense of how to transition with style, a loose understanding of audio, familiarity with the current titling trends for social media, to know whether slow-motion is still cool, and of course, to know what codecs are hot this year.</p>&#13;
			<p>All that is coming up in <em class="italic">Part 3</em>, in the super-sized <em class="italic">Chapters 11</em> through <em class="italic">16</em>, and it's going to be fun. But it's not really about editing, as such. Trimming just a couple of frames off one clip, nudging a bit here and there — you've got it already. Experience will guide you as to where your deft touch is needed. Next up, though: color! And it's not nearly as difficult as you've heard.</p>&#13;
