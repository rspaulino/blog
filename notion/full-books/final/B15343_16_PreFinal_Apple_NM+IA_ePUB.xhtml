			<p class="author-quote">"I enjoy using FCP X so much I wanted to let the world know about it. So, I made a doc<span>umentary."</span></p>&#13;
			<p class="author-quote-source">— Brad Olsen, Director, Off The Tracks:  <a href="http://offthetracksmovie.com">offthetracksmovie.com</a></p>&#13;
			<p>Once you've exported your video, that's it, right? Well, probably not. You (or more likely your client) might decide to rethink a color treatment, or trim a few frames, or fix an unfortunate typo. Unless you're very lucky, the first export is rarely the last, but it's OK to loop back around, tweak a few edits, change a few settings, and send out a version 2, 3, or 14. (Just don't send anything called "final", because it won't be.) </p>&#13;
			<p>Once the review process is over and the finished Project is ready to show to the world, some of you will want to give away your work for free to as many people as possible, and many others will need to deliver it quietly, to a private audience. Either way is fine, and we'll cover many ways to share (or export) here.</p>&#13;
			<p>As well as showing you the quickest and easiest ways to prepare and then share your Projects with the world, this chapter will also show you how to share high-quality masters for archiving or further production, how to send your Project to other applications for collaboration purposes, and how to safely archive your work for future use. Lastly, you'll discover a few ways in which you can extend your skills, because media production is forever changing.</p>&#13;
			<p>This last chapter covers the following topics:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Preparing f<span>or sharing</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Exporting, uploading, and distributing <span>your video</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Exporting for further <span>production</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Archiving<span> your work</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Wh<span>at's next?</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Excited? I am, and I hope you are too. It's been a long journey, and we're nearing its end.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-471"><a id="_idTextAnchor492"/>Preparing for sharing</h1>&#13;
			<p>One of the two <a id="_idIndexMarker1387"/>main ways to finish off a video is to export the final file yourself, and that's what you'll learn to do in this section. First, you'll prepare your file for sharing by making sure the video and audio are within legal bounds. Next, you'll actually share out a file suitable for uploading. Finally, you'll drag it into a browser (or use an app) and upload it to whatever sharing services or other apps you want to send it to. There are other workflows, too, and you'll discover them on the way.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-472"><a id="_idTextAnchor493"/>Performing final checks</h2>&#13;
			<p>Before you share your<a id="_idIndexMarker1388"/> video more widely, it's an excellent idea to take one last look over it. You'll have seen your timeline many times by now, and if you have any spare time before your deadline, spending some of that time on an entirely different Project (or away from the computer altogether) will buy you a fresh perspective. With eyes and ears open, watch your timeline and judge whether every edit is as good as it could be, every shot is as bright and shiny as it should be, and everyone's skin tones look the same from one shot to the next.</p>&#13;
			<p>And then fix all the things you suddenly noticed.</p>&#13;
			<p>With your final viewing out of the way, some more automated effects can save you, and if you're going to be making changes to your master Project, right-click on that Project in the<strong class="bold"> Browser</strong> and then duplicate it before you go any further:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer807" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_16.1_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.1: This is modern version control,<span> isn't it?</span></p>&#13;
			<p>If there's a space before a number at the end, that number will increment, and you just need to double-click on<a id="_idIndexMarker1389"/> that new Project to make sure you're editing the latest (and hopefully, final) version.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-473"><a id="_idTextAnchor494"/>Limiting the audio levels</h3>&#13;
			<p>If you've followed the<a id="_idIndexMarker1390"/> audio workflow from <a href="B15343_14_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor404"><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em></a>, <em class="italic">Boost the Signal: Audio Sweetening</em>, you've probably already turned everything into a Compound Clip, and monitored the audio levels to make sure no levels peaked too high. If you haven't followed that workflow and audio is important, please do so.</p>&#13;
			<p>Of course, if your destination isn't fussy about these things and you're out of time, you can skip these steps.</p>&#13;
			<p>When your edit is contained within a Compound Clip, you can add additional effects to it, making sure that nothing goes too high:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer808" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_16.2_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.2: Here's a Limiter applied to a Project-wide Compound Clip, to make sure nothin<span>g can peak</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Compressor</strong>, <strong class="bold">Limiter</strong>, and <strong class="bold">AUDynamicsProcessor</strong> are all good options that can <a id="_idIndexMarker1391"/>keep audio from getting too loud and, of course, you can control the overall volume manually, with or without keyframes.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-474"><a id="_idTextAnchor495"/>Limiting the video levels</h3>&#13;
			<p>While excessive video<a id="_idIndexMarker1392"/> levels are less likely to create problems for viewers than excessive audio levels, it's still something that some delivery mechanisms can be fussy about, and it's easy to fix. So, if your destination specifies that video levels need to be "broadcast legal," all you need to do is throw on a <strong class="bold">Broadcast Safe</strong> video effect from the <strong class="bold">Color</strong> category:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer809" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_16.3_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.3: The Broadcast Safe filter has a few options, tweakable for broadcast or <span>HDR output</span></p>&#13;
			<p>You can verify that the <strong class="bold">Broadcast Safe</strong> effect has done its job by activating the Viewer's <strong class="bold">Range Check</strong> setting. Head to the <strong class="bold">View</strong> menu in the Viewer, then choose <strong class="bold">All</strong> from the <strong class="bold">Range Check</strong> section near the bottom. With those "zebra" lines active, flick the effect on and off in the Inspector to see the difference, if any. However, if your destination isn't fussy about these things, you can skip all these steps.</p>&#13;
			<p>If you've created a Compound Clip for audio mixing, you can add it to that Compound Clip. If you haven't, you can add an adjustment layer on top of the whole timeline and then add the effect there. The default settings in the effect should be fine, but tweak them to follow <a id="_idIndexMarker1393"/>whatever specs you've been given.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-475"><a id="_idTextAnchor496"/>Creating duplicate Projects for different aspect ratios</h2>&#13;
			<p>With the <a id="_idIndexMarker1394"/>audio and video sounding and looking good, it's time to create any additional versions you might need to produce for alternative aspect ratios. For example, you might have a primary deliverable at 16:9 for regular computers and TVs, plus a shorter square version and/or a vertical version for other platforms. This is now much easier to configure thanks to <em class="italic">new features </em><em class="italic">in 10.4.9</em>.</p>&#13;
			<p>And once more, if you only need to deliver to a single aspect ratio, you can skip &#13;
these steps.</p>&#13;
			<p>For each alternative aspect ratio, follow these steps:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Click once in the <strong class="bold">Browser</strong> to give focus to that inter<span>face pane.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Right-click on your <strong class="bold">Project</strong> in the <strong class="bold">Browser</strong> and choose <strong class="bold">Duplicate Proj</strong><span><strong class="bold">ect As...</strong></span><span>:</span><div id="_idContainer810" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_16.4_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.4: Duplicating your Project is a great safeguard and a way to create alternative asp<span>ect ratios</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Project Properties</strong> panel that appears, give the new Project a name that includes the aspect ratio, such as <strong class="source-inline">square</strong> or<span> </span><span><strong class="source-inline">vertic<a id="_idTextAnchor497"/>al</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Change the <strong class="bold">Video Format</strong> and <strong class="bold">Resolution</strong> properties to fit your new aspect ratio, using the built-in presets or typing your own values into <strong class="bold">Custom</strong> to suit the provided speci<span>fications.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Check the <strong class="bold">Smart Conform</strong> option, then press <strong class="bold">OK</strong>,<span> as shown:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer811" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_16.5_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.5: If the main deliverable is approved in 16:9 aspect, you'll need to get this square version ap<span>proved too</span></p>&#13;
			<p>When used <a id="_idIndexMarker1395"/>automatically like this, <strong class="bold">Smart Conform</strong> here applies to every clip on the timeline, so you'll have to wait for a short while as the clips are analyzed. (If you don't check this box now, you can later select all the clips and then choose <strong class="bold">Modify</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Smart Conform</strong>). Either way, you'll see this:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer812" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_16.6_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.6: Smart Conform will take a shor<span>t time to </span>&#13;
figure out what the best framing is for<span> each shot</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Smart Conform should help a lot, but you may still find that some shots need to be reframed manually, as discussed in <a href="B15343_12_PreFinal_Apple_SK+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor331"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></a>, <em class="italic">Refine and Smooth: Video Properties and Effects</em>. Head through the timeline shot by shot, repositioning and scaling each one as needed, using <strong class="bold">Transform Overscan</strong> so that you can check that you're choosing the best part of each shot. With any luck, you've planned for this by shooting wider than you needed with a high-resolution camera, but if a shot just doesn't work, you might have to replace it with an alternative shot, or two shots in a split-screen.</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer813" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_16.7_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.7: Smart Conform was a good start, but the X position still needed a <span>tweak here</span></p>&#13;
			<p>In each <a id="_idIndexMarker1396"/>different version of your Project, the audio can stay the same, the color will be fine, and any captions should still work. Most effects will work properly too, but some transitions (especially third-party complex ones) might look a little odd. If a transition assumes that the frame is <strong class="source-inline">16:9</strong>, you could see some glitches around the edges, but most of the built-in transitions look fine.</p>&#13;
			<p>Another thing that's likely to need work is titles. With <strong class="bold">Motion</strong>, titles can be designed to work automatically with multiple aspect ratios, but many older titles were not. If your titles weren't designed to work in multiple aspect ratios, they may need to be scaled down, repositioned, or replaced entirely. (You'll probably have to scale them down, then copy them, then find all the other titles with the <strong class="bold">Timeline Index</strong>, and then <strong class="bold">Paste Attributes</strong> to fix them. And if those titles are in Compound Clips, remember to use <strong class="bold">Reference New Parent Clip</strong> to avoid destroying the original versions).</p>&#13;
			<p>With regard to lower thirds and bumpers, you can avoid problems by choosing aspect-adaptable third-party titles, or use a style that's more square than rectangular to help it work in more contexts.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">Another use for titles is to control how burned-in captions appear. As you'll see soon, the built-in options for burning in are very basic, so if you have to control font and appearance, you'll have to convert them to titles instead. Look at <strong class="bold">X-Title Extractor</strong> from <a href="http://spherico.com/filmtools">spherico.com/filmtools</a> for more<span> on this. </span></p>&#13;
			<p>Some clients <a id="_idIndexMarker1397"/>have alternative forms of their logos available for different aspect ratios, so check the style guide and replace the logo if you need to. If you've wrapped the logo in a Compound Clip, duplicate that Compound Clip so you don't mess up the original version.</p>&#13;
			<p>With the aspect ratio(s) taken care of, it's time to make use of all that work you put into roles way back at the start of the Project.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-476"><a id="_idTextAnchor498"/>Limiting role visibility</h3>&#13;
			<p>If you've used Roles<a id="_idIndexMarker1398"/> to separate different languages (or anything else) for titles or audio, this is the time to turn them on or off, so as to make sure the right clips are active. <strong class="bold">Timeline Index</strong> is the place to check and fix this; just turn on the things you want and any extra languages off:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer814" class="figure">&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.8: No Titles, no Dialogue, <span>no problem</span></p>&#13;
			<p>OK, you're <a id="_idIndexMarker1399"/>ready. Video, audio, aspect ratio all checked. Nearly time to export.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-477"><a id="_idTextAnchor499"/>Setting up a sharing preset</h2>&#13;
			<p>Standards will<a id="_idIndexMarker1400"/> change over time, but today, H.264 is the most commonly used standard codec for exporting compressed video. H.265 (HEVC) is another option, and while it can produce similar quality at lower data rates, it currently takes much longer to export and requires Apple's Compressor application; for now, we'll stay with H.264. Before we jump into the process, we'll quickly set up a couple of presets to make things easier. It's a good idea to set up your presets first and then stick to them, and here's how you do it:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Choose <strong class="bold">Final Cut Pro</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Pr</strong><span><strong class="bold">eferences</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Click <strong class="bold">Destinations</strong>, and then <strong class="bold">Add Destination</strong> at the bo<span>ttom left.</span><p>This pane lets you change the export presets. If you own Apple's Compressor app, you'll be able to add extra options here, but most users can get by with the built-in options.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Drag <strong class="bold">Export File</strong> from the area on the right to the menu on<span> the left:</span><div id="_idContainer815" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_16.9_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.9: When you drag from the right to the left, a new destination <span>is created</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Set <strong class="bold">Format</strong> to<span> </span><span><strong class="bold">Computer</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Set <strong class="bold">Resolution</strong> to <a id="_idIndexMarker1401"/>the largest setting possible, <span><strong class="bold">4096x2160</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Change <strong class="bold">Action</strong> to <strong class="bold">QuickTime Player</strong>. (If <strong class="bold">QuickTime Player</strong> isn't an option, choose <strong class="bold">Other</strong>, and then find <strong class="bold">QuickTime Player</strong> in the <strong class="bold">Applicati</strong><span><strong class="bold">ons</strong></span><span> menu.)</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Double-click on <strong class="bold">Export File</strong> and rename it<span> </span><span><strong class="source-inline">Computer</strong></span><span>:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer816" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_16.10_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.10: Computer, all set up f<span>or sharing</span></p>&#13;
			<p>This is a one-time operation that creates a new high-quality preset for almost any kind of online sharing <a id="_idIndexMarker1402"/>service. But what do the format options mean? All these options use the H.264 codec, but with different container formats and at different data rates:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Apple Devices</strong> uses a <strong class="source-inline">.m4v</strong> container at a lower data rate (~10 Mbps for 1080p, ~20 Mb<span>ps for 4K)</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Web Hosting</strong> uses a <strong class="source-inline">.mov</strong> container at a low to moderate data rate (~15 Mbps for 1080p, ~20 Mb<span>ps for 4K)</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Computer</strong> uses a <strong class="source-inline">.mp4</strong> container at a high data rate (~20 Mbps for 1080p, ~30 Mb<span>ps for 4K)</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Don't worry too much about data rates. When you upload a video to an online sharing service such as YouTube or Vimeo, that service compresses it down to a much smaller data rate (as little as 2.5 Mbps for 1080p), so your job is simply to provide a file that looks good to them, so that their recompression looks good too. Reducing the data rate will make your upload go faster, but greatly increases the chance that compression artifacts will be visible after it's recompressed — and there's no way to avoid that final recompression process.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">There's one exception: if a client will be distributing your final videos directly on their own network, you might need to directly produce files at a lower data rate than any of these options. For this, I recommend the free Handbrake app (<a href="http://handbrake.fr">handbrake.fr</a>) because it produces acceptable quality at a much lower data rate (under 4 Mbps for 1080p) than Final Cut Pro X or even Compr<span>essor can.</span></p>&#13;
			<p>While dedicated compression apps such as Compressor and Handbrake can offer a wide range of options, you don't need to worry about them if the final destination is any kind of video sharing site or social media platform — just keep the data rate high and let the site take care<a id="_idIndexMarker1403"/> of the rest:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer817" class="figure">&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.11: Most people won't need to mess with Handbrake, although it works a<span>nd is free</span></p>&#13;
			<p><strong class="bold">Computer</strong> has a high enough data rate to avoid compression artifacts, but not so large that it's hard to work with. Another reason to choose <strong class="bold">Computer</strong> is its container format. The MPEG-4 container (<strong class="source-inline">.mp4</strong>) is widely recognized as a video format, and plays on many kinds of devices. While you can rename <strong class="source-inline">.m4v</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">.mov</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">.mp4</strong> and most players will still function correctly, they're not quite the same internally. Just pick <strong class="bold">Computer</strong>.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-478"><a id="_idTextAnchor500"/>Review — Preparing for sharing</h2>&#13;
			<p>You've done a few <a id="_idIndexMarker1404"/>things here. You fixed the audio and video to valid limits, and made it look and sound as good as you could. If you needed to make any duplicates for alternative aspect ratios, you made them — or at least, you did once the edit was signed off. And you've set up a preset that you can use to export<a id="_idIndexMarker1405"/> to just about anyone. Sorted! Let's get something out there.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-479"><a id="_idTextAnchor501"/>Exporting, uploading, and distributing your video</h1>&#13;
			<p>In this section, you'll <a id="_idIndexMarker1406"/>learn how to turn your timeline<a id="_idIndexMarker1407"/> into a finished video, and then how to get<a id="_idIndexMarker1408"/> it in front of people. You'll want to show your client first, get their feedback, and make their changes in an efficient way. When everyone's finally happy, you'll want to put it on any number of video sites and social media platforms. But it all starts with a file, and that file will be compressed.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-480"><a id="_idTextAnchor502"/>Exporting a compressed video</h2>&#13;
			<p>There are several<a id="_idIndexMarker1409"/> easy ways to export a high-quality file, including direct-to-site exports and master files, but we'll go for the one that works every time. For a complete experience, you'll want to find a Project that includes captions, in either 1080p or 4K resolution. To get started, perform the following steps:</p>&#13;

				<li value="1">Double-click the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> you want <span>to export.</span><p>This step isn't strictly necessary, as you can export a selected Project you're not currently working on, but it's a good confirmation that you're exporting the correct timeline.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>If you want to select only part of the video, switch to the <strong class="bold">Range Selection</strong> tool (<strong class="bold">R</strong>) and drag a range, or press <strong class="bold">I</strong> at the start and <strong class="bold">O</strong> a<span>t the end.</span><p>This step is entirely optional, and is only needed for partial exports.</p></li>&#13;

			<p>With each export, you'll just want to check the name and that the caption settings are correct — it's easy once you know how.

			<p>Importantly, if you have several edits to export, you can do that easily. Just select them all at once in the Browser (don't double-click) and then share them all in a single operation:</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.19: Exporting multiple Projects at once is entirely possible, and v<span>ery useful</span></p>&#13;
			<p>In a multi-Project export, you won't be able to select only part of a timeline, and you can't change<a id="_idIndexMarker1415"/> the names, descriptions, or settings for individual Projects, but that's likely not a problem — it's a big time saver. Though you may not need to, it's also possible to export Compound Clips or regular clips in the same way.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">My preferred workflow is always to export a file, and then to upload it in a separate step. While it is possible to upload directly to YouTube or Vimeo using the built-in export presets, I avoid these direct-upload options for a fe<span>w reasons.</span></p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">Firstly, Final Cut Pro X must be kept running for the entire upload process, and while that's usually quick, a slow network connection or a large file can make it take much longer. It's also not easy to find and keep a copy of the video file made as part of this process, and I always want to archive that file with the rest o<span>f the job.</span></p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">These methods don't allow SRT captions to be uploaded automatically, so you'll need to add captions manually. Similarly, other site-specific video settings aren't always supported. For example, direct Vimeo uploads can't be set to "Anyone with the private link", a common sharing option. And when the video is finished uploading, you'll have to visit the site to get a link for a client revi<span>ew anyway.</span></p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">By all means, use the instant-upload Share presets if you have a very fast upload speed and don't care about keeping your exported video files — those features do work. But at some point, you'll need to visit th<span>e website.</span></p>&#13;
			<p>With a compressed video and caption file in hand, you can upload it to the video site of choice through <a id="_idIndexMarker1416"/>a browser, through a dedicated uploading app, or give it to the client via a file sharing service such as iCloud Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, or something else. But there are a few fancy options too, so let's take this to the next step.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-481"><a id="_idTextAnchor503"/>Uploading for client review</h2>&#13;
			<p>To upload a <a id="_idIndexMarker1417"/>compressed file, you might use a browser, third-party integrated service, or an uploading app — but using a website through a browser is the universal option. If you're using a browser to upload a draft, the rough process is something like the following:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Open a browser (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and so on) and head to the site you want to post your<span> video to.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Log in and click the <strong class="bold">Upload</strong> or <strong class="bold">Crea</strong><span><strong class="bold">te</strong></span><span> button.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Drag your compressed video file into th<span>e browser.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>While the video uploads, apply privacy settings, keeping it privat<span>e for now.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Upload your<span> captions.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Send your client a link f<span>or review.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>The review loop will involve receiving feedback, duplicating your Project, making the changes, and repeating all these aforementioned steps. While captions may not be completed until the final version, the client will need to check them at some point before distribution.</p>&#13;
			<p>Which site(s) are good for review? Most video professionals today use <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a> or <a href="http://Frame.io">Frame.io</a>, though other options exist. <a href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</a> is very popular for final delivery, but it's less commonly used for client review:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer826" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_16.20_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.20: The Vimeo menu bar app lets you quickly copy a link to a r<span>eview page</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Unlike YouTube, both Vimeo and Frame.io offer dedicated apps that can make the upload process<a id="_idIndexMarker1418"/> faster and more efficient. Their review and commenting workflows allow clients to leave notes at specific moments in the video, security is tighter, and Frame.io even allows client comments to be reimported to your timeline through &#13;
an extension.</p>&#13;
			<p>There's a lot to both of these services, but I don't want to get into much detail as these are both paid subscriptions, they'll change over time, and they have competitors. If you're exchanging videos with clients, look into the options currently available as they could save you serious time in the review process.</p>&#13;
			<p>A less useful alternative is to share videos through a file storage service such as Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, or iCloud Drive. These all include Finder integration with their apps, so the upload process is as simple as putting the file into a folder and waiting for it to sync. However, file storage sites aren't great at client review, don't always deliver video in a reliable way to all platforms, and can't be used to deliver the final video to a wider audience — important if the client wants to simply flick a switch and make it live. As a halfway house, integrations exist between some video sharing sites and online storage services (for example, you could upload a file to Google Drive and then instantly transfer it to Vimeo), so look into what your services can offer if you want to speed up the upload process.</p>&#13;
			<p>You may wish to check the final video quality after that site's recompression, but be ready to be disappointed. If you look for flaws, you'll see compression artifacts even on paid streaming services, with the worst picture quality to be found in features shot on film. All that lovely grain doesn't compress well, and you'll often see blocky noise in the shadows. Weirdly, a clean video shot on a modern camera will suffer a lot less from these issues.</p>&#13;
			<p>If you're unhappy <a id="_idIndexMarker1419"/>with your final video quality online, you'll probably find that reducing image complexity and noise will help a lot more than increasing the data rate of the file you send them. The best version of any movie is always the one you see in the edit bay, and nobody else can see it in the same way.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-482"><a id="_idTextAnchor504"/>Uploading for distribution</h2>&#13;
			<p>At the end of the<a id="_idIndexMarker1420"/> review process, when everything is signed off, you'll probably want to send your video somewhere. For many editors, that means putting it up for free online, and that's what this section is about. If that's not what you're about, no problem — skip down to the next section:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer827" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_16.21_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.21: Make sure not to close the window during the uplo<span>ad process</span></p>&#13;
			<p>YouTube is currently the king of free video distribution online. The website is very good, offering extensive auto-captioning and translation, caption editing, commenting, monetization, and much more. It's extremely popular, with apps on almost every platform, and can really bring an audience:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer828" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_16.22_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.22: Caption editing is comprehensive, and begins with automatically generate<span>d captions</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Video-focused competitors such as Vimeo focus more on embedded and paid distribution, while social platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and others distribute<a id="_idIndexMarker1421"/> short, free videos to millions of viewers a day. Many more social media platforms are waiting to be launched and will have failed before you read this, so I won't go into too many specifics about your final video distribution.</p>&#13;
			<p>If the target platform has a website, you can probably use that, but if not, you may need to send the final video file to your phone, and upload from the dedicated app. (AirDrop is a great way to move files from your Mac to an iPhone or iPad.)</p>&#13;
			<p>For distribution through YouTube, Vimeo, or another site, just follow the upload process from the preceding client review. You'll need your final video file, your captions, and also the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Thumbnail images that are intriguing but no<span>t annoying</span></li>&#13;
				<li>A full description that appeals to people and <span>algorithms</span></li>&#13;
				<li>A plan for advertising and<span> promotion</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Don't underestimate the power of promotion, or your very good video will go unsung and unnoticed. Expectation management is also important. While no views at all is bad, small numbers can be pretty normal. Remember that most videos are intended for a very specific audience — whatever niche your clients are trying to reach — and that the vast majority of videos will never see the millions of views in a day that every popular music video gets:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer829" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_16.23_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.23: So… most people don't actually watch a wh<span>ole video?</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Every site counts views differently, and you can stare deep into the abyss of analytics if you really want to, but you'd be surprised how little of a video has to be seen to count as a "view." Consistency<a id="_idIndexMarker1422"/> over time will help you build an audience, but if there was a magic formula for success, everyone would follow it.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">Recently, YouTube allowed videos to be segmented into chapters by entering timestamps in the description, which is a good way to break up longer videos. While it's unfortunate that no services currently recognize the built-in <strong class="bold">Chapter Markers</strong>, the app <strong class="bold">Creator's Best Friend</strong> (in the Mac App Store) can convert timeline-based Chapter Markers into the right format for YouTube, saving you effort. This is very useful if you'd like to distribute longer videos, but something you'd have to do by hand<span> on Vimeo.</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Each platform has its own style and its own set of restrictions, so you'll need to play by the local rules regarding duration and aspect ratios. You'll want to experiment to find out whether short or long videos work best (short, usually) and what kinds of videos each platform's audience prefers.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-483"><a id="_idTextAnchor505"/>Review — Exporting, uploading, and distributing your video</h2>&#13;
			<p>You can now export a high-quality compressed file and a caption file, and then upload them. Websites are easy, and you know about apps too. You've been along the review path, received feedback, made changes, and done it all again. You've also considered distribution, and you're OK with your video not getting a million views in its first week.</p>&#13;
			<p>But wait a minute. If you're not the last link in the production chain, you won't be the one who distributes the final file, and you may well not care about this online stuff at all. Instead, you might need to collaborate with other professionals who will edit and finesse color, audio, or visual effects in a way you can't. And that's coming up next.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-484"><a id="_idTextAnchor506"/>Exporting for further production</h1>&#13;
			<p>While the last <a id="_idIndexMarker1423"/>section focused on compressed output, in this section, you'll learn all about high-quality output, for delivering the final product, or just your part of a larger job. You'll learn about ProRes, about audio stems, about the wonders of XML and the workflows it enables, and even how to work with other editors.</p>&#13;
			<p>In some cases, you'll export high-quality finished files (in some flavor of ProRes) and in others you'll provide your original media files along with an XML file, or some kind of compressed version. It's even possible that you might send an entire Library and everything inside it. The wider world of production uses a variety of different applications for audio and for video, and if you want to work with others, you'll need to be able to send them something they can work with.</p>&#13;
			<p>High-quality files are a good place to start. We've mentioned it before, but let's take a deep dive into ProRes.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-485"><a id="_idTextAnchor507"/>Understanding ProRes</h2>&#13;
			<p>ProRes is a family <a id="_idIndexMarker1424"/>of intermediate or "mezzanine" codecs<a id="_idIndexMarker1425"/> that are ideal for high-quality exports. While it's easy to export to this popular Apple-made format, first let's understand why you might want to do this.</p>&#13;
			<p>You may remember an earlier discussion about optimized media, way back in <a href="B15343_03_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor084"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Bring It In: Importing Your Footage</em>. Optimizing a clip means converting it to ProRes 422 to make it easier to edit than the original compressed video formats. Some compressed formats are easier to work with and don't require any optimization, while other formats are difficult or impossible and must be converted to ProRes 422 first. Not all files are equal, and not all H.264 files are the same; some may need to be optimized:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer830" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_16.24_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.24: Use one or both of these if you're working with difficu<span>lt media, </span>&#13;
but neither if your footage is easy to<span> work with</span></p>&#13;
			<p>As ProRes is a widely accepted format in the industry, it's a sensible choice for sending high-quality files to other professionals for further editing or production. The codec is designed to make decoding as quick as possible, even in Multicam workflows, and can be recompressed into the same codec many times over without visual degradation. ProRes is an intra-frame codec in which each frame is independently compressed, and while not all<a id="_idIndexMarker1426"/> intra-frame codecs are easy to work with, ProRes<a id="_idIndexMarker1427"/> &#13;
definitely is:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer831" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_16.25_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.25: This one-second ProRes 4444 XQ movie has a huge d<span>ata rate, </span>&#13;
but it does play<span> back well</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Data rates are variable, jumping up to accommodate more detail, and also vary depending on the frame rate and frame size chosen. Refer to the Apple ProRes White Paper (<a href="https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/docs/Apple_ProRes_White_Paper.pdf">https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/docs/Apple_ProRes_White_Paper.pdf</a>) for all the fine details.</p>&#13;
			<p>Optimized always means the "regular" ProRes 422, though there are other members of the codec family that you might choose to use for exporting. While visible quality loss is unlikely with regular ProRes 422, you can choose to use a lower-quality version (to save space) or higher-quality version (for the most demanding post-production applications) if you prefer. Including the approximate target data rate for 1080p @ 29.97 fps, here are your ProRes choices:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">ProRes 422 Proxy</strong> — 45 Mbps, low <a id="_idIndexMarker1428"/>quality, usually shows visible artifacts and so should not be used for<span> exporting</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">ProRes 422 LT</strong> — 102 Mbps, medium<a id="_idIndexMarker1429"/> quality, sometimes shows visible artifacts and so should be used only if space or bandwidth are <span>restricted</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">ProRes 422</strong> — 147 Mbps, high <a id="_idIndexMarker1430"/>quality, good for high-quali<span>ty exports</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">ProRes 422 HQ</strong> — 220<a id="_idIndexMarker1431"/> Mbps, very high quality, good for high-quality exports for footage from high-e<span>nd cameras</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">ProRes 4444</strong> — 330<a id="_idIndexMarker1432"/> Mbps, very high quality with <strong class="source-inline">4:4:4</strong> color space and transparency support, good for high-quality exports for footage from high-end cameras where full color information or transparency i<span>s required</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">ProRes 4444 XQ</strong> — 500 <a id="_idIndexMarker1433"/>Mbps, extremely high quality with <strong class="source-inline">4:4:4</strong> color space and transparency support, good for the absolute best exports for footage from the very best cameras where full color information or transparency i<span>s required</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>While it's tempting just to turn every setting up to maximum, you'll hit some real-world limits at the incredibly high data rates of 4K. For example, a UHD Computer export to H.264 takes up 30 Mbps, but ProRes 422 is far higher at 492 Mbps, or 221 GB per hour, and ProRes 422 HQ adds 50% on top of that! While those numbers might not seem such a big deal for a single file delivered on a hard drive, if your internet connection is less than top-tier, you'll find it takes a while to upload high-quality files.</p>&#13;
			<p>Though a single file is unlikely to fill up your hard drive, if you're using ProRes as a codec throughout production (for example, with an external recorder), then you'll need a lot more of it. While many professionals are used to this, if you're planning to send high-quality files around in post-production, make sure you have enough storage, and enough time to move it around. Only use the 4444 versions of ProRes if you're working with VFX houses or need to support transparency, as they're almost certainly overkill otherwise.</p>&#13;
			<p>Now that you <a id="_idIndexMarker1434"/>know what the different kinds of ProRes are for, how do you export them? That depends on whether you're exporting a simple movie, or if you have more complex requirements. Simple stuff first.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-486"><a id="_idTextAnchor508"/>Exporting a simple Project</h2>&#13;
			<p>Assuming you've<a id="_idIndexMarker1435"/> already prepared your Project for sharing by following the earlier steps, this process is very similar to exporting a compressed file:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Select a <strong class="bold">Project</strong>, a <strong class="bold">Compound Clip</strong>, a <strong class="bold">clip</strong>, or <strong class="bold">part of a Project</strong> using the <strong class="bold">Range Selection</strong> tool, o<span>r </span><span><strong class="bold">I </strong></span><span>and </span><span><strong class="bold">O</strong></span><span>:</span><div id="_idContainer832" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_16.26_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.26: If you only want to export part of a longer Project, selec<span>t it first</span></p></li>&#13;

				<li>If desired, change the name, creator,<span> and tags.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Click <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> at the top, and make sure <strong class="bold">Format</strong> is set to <strong class="bold">Video </strong><span><strong class="bold">and Audio</strong></span><span>:</span><div id="_idContainer833" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_16.27_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.27: Master File exports cannot change the re<span>solution, </span>&#13;
but will always match t<span>he Project</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Under <strong class="bold">Video Codec</strong>, choose the variant of ProRes you're looking for, or use the default for your Project by choosi<span>ng </span><span><strong class="bold">Source</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>If you need to send captions, click on <strong class="bold">Roles</strong> and make sure the correct options ar<span>e checked.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Click <strong class="bold">Next</strong>, choose<a id="_idIndexMarker1436"/> where to save the file, and then c<span>lick </span><span><strong class="bold">Save</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>That file can now be sent on for further post-production or even distribution. And yes, it is possible (though usually overkill) to upload ProRes or ProRes LT files to sites such as YouTube. Some people swear that it gives better quality, but I'm yet to see that myself. Always remember that every video platform will mercilessly crush whatever you send it, and pushing up the data rate too far just makes it take longer to get it there.</p>&#13;
			<p>It's also worth noting that the <strong class="bold">Video Codec</strong> menu hides a few non-ProRes options, too. The uncompressed options shouldn't be used unless absolutely necessary as the files are absolutely colossal: more than 3x the data rate of ProRes 4444 XQ. Truly uncompressed video is something rarely seen today, as it's difficult to work with &#13;
and transport:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer834" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_16.28_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.28: Codec options include a lot of ProRes, plus H.264 and Un<span>compressed</span></p>&#13;
			<p>But there's a far more compressed option in the same menu. If you choose <strong class="bold">H.264</strong>, it will export at the frame size of the Project, to an approximate data rate of 12.5 Mbps in 1080p (lower than the <strong class="bold">Computer</strong> export preset's 20 Mbps) or 50 Mbps in 4K (much higher than <strong class="bold">Computer</strong>'s 30 Mbps). If you ever notice that a 4K Project has visible artifacts when using the <strong class="bold">Computer</strong> export preset, remember this as an option, but don't use it for 1080p Projects.</p>&#13;
			<p>The movie<a id="_idIndexMarker1437"/> you've just made functions like a single file, and can be used like one. But you can do a whole lot more if you need to keep the different parts of your Project separate for further post-production. The best way to keep those components apart is with Roles, and here's how to take best advantage of their power.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-487"><a id="_idTextAnchor509"/>Exporting separate elements with Roles</h2>&#13;
			<p>For a multi-element<a id="_idIndexMarker1438"/> export, find a more complex Project, one with a few titles (using the Title role) and <a id="_idIndexMarker1439"/>different kinds of audio (Effects, Music). When you're ready, start the export process again:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Select a <strong class="bold">Project</strong>, or <strong class="bold">part of a Project</strong> using the <strong class="bold">Range Selection</strong> tool, o<span>r </span><span><strong class="bold">I </strong></span><span>and </span><span><strong class="bold">O</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">File</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Share</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Master File</strong> or choose <strong class="bold">Master File</strong> from the <strong class="bold">Share</strong> drop-down menu at the <span>top right.</span></li>&#13;

				<li>Click <strong class="bold">Next</strong>, choose where to save the file, and then clic<span>k on </span><span><strong class="bold">Save</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>To test that this workflow was successful, you can reimport the file back into one of your Libraries. If you add it to a timeline and then <strong class="bold">⌥-double-click</strong> the audio waveform, you'll see multiple channels, with different content on each. They won't have the correct role names, but that can be easily communicated:</p>&#13;

			<p>Some applications<a id="_idIndexMarker1442"/> can't<a id="_idIndexMarker1443"/> deal with a multitrack QuickTime movie, and need entirely separate files. Repeat steps 1–4 above, then click on <strong class="bold">Roles</strong>, and then click the &#13;
drop-down menu in the top-left corner and choose <strong class="bold">Separate Files</strong>. Very similar controls allow you to add not just extra tracks, but extra <strong class="source-inline">.aiff</strong> files for audio. (AIFF is an uncompressed format that's very similar to <strong class="source-inline">.wav</strong>, and widely readable.) The audio files created this way, known as <em class="italic">stems</em>, are named for their Roles and will be straightforward for an audio post-production specialist to deal with:</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.31: Exporting to separate files is another option from the<span> same menu</span></p>&#13;
			<p>While it's<a id="_idIndexMarker1444"/> tempting to<a id="_idIndexMarker1445"/> create separate files for video and for titles, there's an issue. Only a single format can be chosen for both of these files, and while you'll need to use a larger 4444 format to maintain transparency in the titles, you don't need such a heavy format for the video. If you would prefer to export the titles to ProRes 4444 and the regular video to ProRes 422, you'll have to do that in two operations.</p>&#13;
			<p>You can choose to export only video or audio as separate files from the same top-left menu, and, to make repeated tasks easier, you can save export presets there too:</p>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.32: Doing this a lot? Save<span> a preset!</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Depending on requirements, you might end up exporting a few different versions:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>A regular QuickTime movie for reference (everything active, one Video, and one Au<span>dio track)</span></li>&#13;
				<li>A multitrack text-free QuickTime movie for translation purposes (Video on, Titles off, all audio tracks on, but Dialogue will be<span> replaced)</span></li>&#13;
				<li>A separate files version with a Video only file, a Video + Titles file, and all Audio Roles<span> separated</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Whether you go <a id="_idIndexMarker1446"/>for separate<a id="_idIndexMarker1447"/> files or multitrack QuickTime movies will depend on who you're collaborating with. Ask them what they'd prefer, and try the different options out. Still, an audio professional might reply with a request such as "Can you send me an OMF?". Well, OMF is a dead format, but it's been replaced by AAF, and that's just one of many formats you can deliver with the help of XML.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-488"><a id="_idTextAnchor510"/>Exporting to XML</h2>&#13;
			<p>To enable various<a id="_idIndexMarker1448"/> advanced workflows, you'll <a id="_idIndexMarker1449"/>often need to export to XML, an interchange format supported by many applications. <strong class="bold">XML</strong> stands for <strong class="bold">eXtensible Markup Language</strong>, and while it is text-based and human-readable, it's not a fixed format like JPEG or AIFF. Each application that uses XML does so in a different way, so it's not enough for an application to just <em class="italic">support XML</em>, it has to <em class="italic">support a particular version of XML f</em><em class="italic">rom FCP X</em>.</p>&#13;
			<p>The process involves exporting an XML file from Final Cut Pro X, and then passing that along to a third-party app that then re-interprets it. Creating an XML file is easy, but it's also flexible, so you have to make sure you have the right thing selected first. As you can export a Project, an Event, and even an entire Library to XML, you must select whatever you want to export and then choose <strong class="bold">File</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Export XML</strong>. The only clue is the name you'll see when saving the file, as it will reflect the name of the Project, Event, or Library you have selected:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer839" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_16.33_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.33: I'm exporting a Project here, and the name is the<span> only clue</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Importantly, an XML file does not include any media, it just describes the files and/or edits. If you're using XML, you should be following an external media workflow, and you'll need to<a id="_idIndexMarker1450"/> provide the media as well as the XML<a id="_idIndexMarker1451"/> file. For more details, refer to <a href="B15343_03_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor084"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Bring It In: Importing You</em><em class="italic">r Footage</em>.</p>&#13;
			<p>With the XML and media handy, a <a id="_idIndexMarker1452"/>third-party app called <strong class="bold">X2Pro</strong> can handle the conversion to AAF, so an audio engineer using ProTools has full flexibility. If you don't have X2Pro, you might be able to use DaVinci Resolve as a conversion tool of sorts, and it does lots more too. With limits, Resolve and other conversion tools can send timelines to or from other editing applications via XML, which is very handy if you need to finish a job someone else has started.</p>&#13;
			<p>Many other apps can do useful things with XML too. One interesting option is <strong class="bold">Producer's Best Friend</strong>, which can create spreadsheets to report on the exact durations of clips, keywords, roles, and lots more besides. This could be vital if you have to pay royalties for stock footage or audio. In general, if you find an external app that can usefully interpret the data on a timeline, it's probably using XML:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer840" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_16.34_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.34: XML can be imported and exported, and it's a useful transfer<span> mechanism</span></p>&#13;
			<p>You could even periodically export an XML from your timeline to function as a backup of sorts, because you can import an XML file with <strong class="bold">File</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Import</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">XML...</strong>. However, because there are some pieces of information that XML doesn't correctly store (or which aren't correctly read on import), data can be lost in translation. Some text styling and Drop Zone assignments may be set to defaults, but basic edits should be fine. The <strong class="source-inline">.fcpxml</strong> format changes<a id="_idIndexMarker1453"/> regularly, so be sure that all the <a id="_idIndexMarker1454"/>applications in the mix are up to date.</p>&#13;
			<p>If XML's shortcomings mean it doesn't work for you, that's no problem. You need to learn about transfer Libraries.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-489"><a id="_idTextAnchor511"/>Collaborating using libraries</h2>&#13;
			<p>To work with a<a id="_idIndexMarker1455"/> small team, a <a id="_idIndexMarker1456"/>common workflow is to keep matched copies of your media on local, duplicate drives, and share small Libraries between editors. A <em class="italic">lean</em> Library is one that uses external media, and a <em class="italic">transfer</em> Library is a small, lean Library used to transport a single Project in an Event. Depending on your needs, you may choose to use a lean Library (including all clips and Projects) or a transfer Library (just one Project) to work collaboratively.</p>&#13;
			<p>In each case, your editors will need a copy of the media — original, optimized, or some flavor of proxy. If media is kept (as is likely) external to the Library, each editor should place it in the same location, on a hard drive with the same name (or indeed, access the same network-based storage system in an edit facility). That way, relinking may not be needed at all.</p>&#13;
			<p>At a high level, here's the collaboration process:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Share your entire Library (a small file) and your media (large if original, small if proxy) with anoth<span>er editor.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>The other editor opens their copy of your "lean<span>" Library.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>If that Library has no media, they may need to relink to their copy of the media (original, optimized, <span>or proxy).</span></li>&#13;
				<li>The other editor makes duplicates of your Project and makes editin<span>g changes.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>They send a copy of their new Library back, but they don't need to send the media — you alread<span>y have it.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>You open this lean Library and move the new Project back into your original Library without copy<span>ing media.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>The media should now automatically relink, but you can relink manually <span>if needed.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>This workflow works no matter where the editors are; they could be on different machines in the same office and connected to the same storage system, or on different sides of the planet. There is the possibility that you might see some duplication of containers, such as Compound Clips or Multicam Clips, so be careful.</p>&#13;
			<p>How do you share a Library, with or without the media? The 10.4.9 release added a new feature that lets you create a new Library containing some or all of the contents of an existing Library. Even<a id="_idIndexMarker1457"/> better, since<a id="_idIndexMarker1458"/> proxy files can now be really small (H.264 at 12.5% of original size), it's also possible to send a self-contained Library including only proxy media, rather than a totally lean Library. Either way, it's easy:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Select your Library (or Project, or Event) in the Browse<span>r sidebar.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">File</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Copy to Library</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">New Library</strong> (this command will change its name slightly if you select a Project <span>or Event).</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Give the Library a name and c<span>lick </span><span><strong class="bold">Save</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>In the next dialog, choose to include media or send a Library without media (for example, if you plan to send it separately, or they have it <span>already). </span></li>&#13;
				<li>If you choose to include media, pick which kind(s) of media you wish t<span>o include:</span><div id="_idContainer841" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_16.35_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.35: Here, I've chosen to include only proxy media, but I could have chosen to include no me<span>dia at all</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>If you wish, you can also choose to store the media in an external location using <strong class="bold">Media Destination</strong>, but the default is <strong class="bold">I</strong><span><strong class="bold">n Library</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>This new Library<a id="_idIndexMarker1459"/> is entirely independent <a id="_idIndexMarker1460"/>of the original, and much, much smaller. If you'll be sending Libraries backward and forward between editors many times, or want to maximize the image quality for all involved, sending the full media at least once — and storing it externally — is still a good idea. However, sometimes that original media is just too big for a limited internet connection, or the original media is too sensitive to share. In those cases, proxy files can be shared instead, and you can store them inside a Library if you wish.</p>&#13;
			<p>Note that you will see a variation of the preceding dialog when dragging Projects or Clips between Libraries. If the same media clips exist in both Libraries, choose <strong class="bold">Project without media</strong> to try to avoid duplication. Note that if you pass around a Project or a Clip then Library-level organizational niceties, such as folders for Smart Collections, will be lost, so share full Libraries if you need to keep them.</p>&#13;
			<p>If you are using external media, you should double-check that media storage locations are as you want them after each transfer. If possible, to minimize relinking issues while collaborating with external media, make sure to use identical copies of your media, on identically named drives, with strict copying and storage practices. For the official word on media management and collaboration, here's Apple's White Paper: <a href="http://images.apple.com/final-cut-pro/docs/Media_Management.pdf">http://images.apple.com/final-cut-pro/docs/Media_Management.pdf</a>.</p>&#13;
			<p>Manual collaboration isn't hard — and it's certainly been made easier — but it does have the potential for version control issues should both editors work on their own copies of the same Project at the same time. There are more refined ways to collaborate, and probably the best at present is <strong class="bold">Postlab</strong>.</p>&#13;
			<p>In the server-based Postlab system, you can check a Library out when you want to work on it and check <a id="_idIndexMarker1461"/>it back in when you're<a id="_idIndexMarker1462"/> done. In-built version control means that you can roll back to any previous version of a Library, and comments will tell you what has changed in each version. If you're working in even a moderately sized group, look into a professional collaboration solution like this to stay sane.</p>&#13;
			<p>Exporting to ProRes, to multiple separate files, to XML, collaborating, phew. Let's recap.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-490"><a id="_idTextAnchor512"/>Review — Exporting for further production</h2>&#13;
			<p>Post-production requires high-quality files, to make sure that your video and audio data moves through all the stages with minimal quality loss. ProRes is an important codec in that process, and you now know more about how to export to it, as a single high-quality file or in separate files. You also know about XML, and its potential for interfacing with other applications and people, and possibly, you might have decided to use transfer Libraries or something more automated if you want to collaborate.</p>&#13;
			<p>With all those exports under your belt, you might actually be done now. Time to clean up.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-491"><a id="_idTextAnchor513"/>Archiving your work</h1>&#13;
			<p>Here, you'll discover a <a id="_idIndexMarker1463"/>workflow for making sure your work is accessible months or years after a job is completed, with no media or effects missing. The archiving process might not be exciting, but it's definitely important. If a client comes back to you in six months wanting an urgent re-edit on a past Project, you'll win kudos if you can get the job done quickly and easily. While it would be nice if storage was unlimited, you can't keep every past job on your active storage forever; video is big, and expands to fill hard drives of any size. </p>&#13;
			<p>Specifically, you'll find out how to make sure everything's in one place by consolidating the media and everything else you need. Then you'll figure out how to throw things away, first a little, and then a lot. Finally, you'll establish how to manage your archives, and recover from a <a id="_idIndexMarker1464"/>backup.</p>&#13;
			<p>In a few words? Consolidate your old jobs, and then move them somewhere else. Let's start.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-492"><a id="_idTextAnchor514"/>Consolidating media</h2>&#13;
			<p>Consolidation is <a id="_idIndexMarker1465"/>the process of moving all the files you need for a job into one place, to make it easier to copy everything needed to pick up the job again in the future. This is certainly made easier if you store your media inside a Library, as it's just a single item in the Finder, but there are other considerations, too. Let's go over what you'll need to do:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer842" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_16.36_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.36: Including an exported copy of the final Project in the Libr<span>ary itself</span></p>&#13;
			<p>First, it's a great idea to import a final, finished copy of your video to the Library itself. A ProRes file is ideal, but an H.264 copy will do in a pinch, and including the finished movie guards against the possibility that the Library itself is unreadable at some point in the future. How do we peek inside? Libraries are really just fancy folders:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer843" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_16.37_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption"> </p>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.37: Every Library is really a folder that you can pe<span>ek inside </span>&#13;
(but don't move <span>anything!)</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Even without a copy of Final Cut Pro X, anyone can open up a Library to extract the movie files within. All it takes is a quick right-click on the Library, and to choose <strong class="bold">Show Package</strong><strong class="bold"> Contents</strong>:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer844" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_16.38_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.38: My Event is called "media," and inside the Original Media folder you'll see all<span> its files</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Inside the <a id="_idIndexMarker1466"/>package, each Event has a folder with a matching name, and inside that, there's a subfolder called <strong class="bold">Original Media</strong>. The Event's video files are all inside.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">As well as storing this final exported file inside the Library itself, it's a great idea to keep another Library (ideally on another drive) to act as a collection of all your work with which you could build a showreel or simply a private folio. This builds over time, and if your archive drives are somehow lost, you can do a lot with a high-quality export in an <span>emergency.</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Next, decide whether you'd like to store your media inside the Library or externally. Select your Library in the browser's sidebar, click <strong class="bold">Modify Settings</strong> in the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> window, next to <strong class="bold">Storage Locations</strong>, and make your choice there:</p>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption"> </p>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.39: Modify Settings is the button you're l<span>ooking for</span></p>&#13;
			<p>You can stick with the decision you made way back when you made the Library in the first place, or change<a id="_idIndexMarker1467"/> your mind. As discussed, some advanced workflows require external media, but if you're working alone, internal media is easier to manage. Either can be fine, but when you finally move this Library to archive storage, you'll have two things to move with external media, and you may have to reconnect media &#13;
after reopening:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer846" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_16.40_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.40: Currently, this Library uses external media, but I might switch to internal for<span> archiving</span></p>&#13;
			<p>This time around though, do store your <strong class="bold">Motion Content</strong> in the Library, rather than in the <strong class="bold">Motion Templates</strong> folder on your Mac. This way, any custom titles, generators, effects, and transitions you've used will be stored inside the Library, and if you open this Library on another Mac, they won't be missing:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer847" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_16.41_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.41: The Inspector has these Consolidate buttons, and you can find menu items under File that do the <span>same thing</span></p>&#13;
			<p>With the locations confirmed, look again in <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> and click on <strong class="bold">Consolidate</strong> next to <strong class="bold">Media</strong> and next to <strong class="bold">Motion Content</strong>, confirming each one. Now, nearly everything you need will be<a id="_idIndexMarker1468"/> copied into the Library, or into the Library and the external media location. What's potentially missing? Additional elements that you'll need in order to back up manually include the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Color LUTs</strong> loaded from your <span>hard drive</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Non-standard fonts</strong> used<span> in titles</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Third-party effects, titles, generators, transitions, and other plug-ins that use copy protection</strong> — they'll need to be installed on any other Mac that opens yo<span>ur Library</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Your Library is going to be the main focus, though. It's likely to be pretty big, but you can recover some of that space.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-493"><a id="_idTextAnchor515"/>Reducing the size of libraries</h2>&#13;
			<p>The easiest way to <a id="_idIndexMarker1469"/>save space is to select the <strong class="bold">Library</strong>, and then choose <strong class="bold">File</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Delete Generated Library Files</strong>. (New in 10.4.9: you can also delete generated files for only selected clips.) The dialog that appears lets you throw away render files that have been created during the lifetime of the Library, which could be significant. You can use this command any time you want to save some space during your edit, but if you have <strong class="bold">Background Rendering</strong> turned on in preferences, they'll just be recreated. At this point, you might as well delete not just <strong class="bold">Unused</strong> render files, but <strong class="bold">Al</strong><strong class="bold">l</strong> of them.</p>&#13;
			<p>The other kind of file you can throw away is any of your <strong class="bold">Optimized</strong> or <strong class="bold">Proxy</strong> files. Since they're intended to speed up the editing process, and you're done with editing, you don't need them anymore. That'll save a ton of space too:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer848" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_16.42_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.42: Checking all these boxes can save signifi<span>cant space</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Without the <a id="_idIndexMarker1470"/>optimized or proxy files, you'll still have the original media to fall back on; at worst, it'll be a bit slow. Mind you, even the original media can be big, and you can throw more away if you need to.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-494"><a id="_idTextAnchor516"/>Deleting unused media</h2>&#13;
			<p>If your Library is <a id="_idIndexMarker1471"/>still too big, there's one more lever you can pull. The last step here is definitely optional, and not everyone will want to do it. If a number of files were never used, you can throw the unused clips away, creating a new Library that only includes the clips you need. The process is as follows:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Create a new Library with a new name, and set <strong class="bold">Motion Content</strong> to <strong class="bold">I</strong><span><strong class="bold">n Library</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Drag the final version of any Project(s) you want to keep from your existing full Library into the ne<span>w Library.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>When you copy a Project into a new Library, it copies all the clips used in that Project, but nothing else. Other clips don't make the journey, though keywords on used clips will come across. Obviously, if there are amusing behind-the-scenes moments that might be needed later, don't do this. Also know that this technique doesn't trim any media — if you use 10 frames of an hour-long clip, you'll have to keep the entire hour-long clip. But for most <a id="_idIndexMarker1472"/>jobs, it's still going to save a lot of space.</p>&#13;
			<p>Now that you've saved as much storage space as possible, let's get that thing off your main working drive.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-495"><a id="_idTextAnchor517"/>Copying to an archive drive</h2>&#13;
			<p>If the final<a id="_idIndexMarker1473"/> destination is a regular drive, there's nothing fancy here. Just use the <strong class="bold">Finder</strong> to copy the Library (and your external media folder, if you used one) to a large hard drive, and then another one. Label the drives so you know what's on them, and on your main Mac, and make a record of the names of the drives so you know where the Library is. There's a nice third-party app called <strong class="bold">Final Cut Library Manager</strong> that will record where your Libraries live, and much more:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer849" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_16.43_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.43: Final Cut Library Manager can show you what's missing, where space can be saved, and even where Libraries are on disconnec<span>ted drives</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Hard drives will die eventually, and sooner than you'd think if they aren't powered up every few months. Set some periodic reminders to power up your drives and make sure they're OK, and if they're ever not, duplicate a new copy from the remaining good drive. Of your two copies, move at least one drive offsite to guard against natural disasters.</p>&#13;
			<p>If all of that sounds unworkable, consider other solutions. Larger facilities that need longer-term archives might use a tape drive, so if you have one, put your archival Library on a tape. You could also upload your old Libraries to archival storage online. There are options, and the march of technology drives down the cost of storage. It's entirely possible that the situation will have changed in just a few years, so keep an eye on this.</p>&#13;
			<p>However you archive your work, it's sensible to test your archives. Eject your main media drive, and then load up the archival copy of the Library. For extra bonus points, open the new archive copy on a different Mac and make sure everything's there. Normally, you'll <a id="_idIndexMarker1474"/>see an error on opening a Project, and warning symbols in the browser. Most often, it's from a file that wasn't consolidated or an old effect that's been deleted from your system. Either way, if something goes wrong, you can remount your original drive and then consolidate the new Library one more time.</p>&#13;
			<p>When you know the archive is OK, the original copy is safe to delete, but I tend not to delete it straight away. Instead, I keep three folders on my working drive: <strong class="source-inline">1 ACTIVE</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">2 COMPLETED</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">3 </strong><strong class="source-inline">ARCHIVED</strong>: </p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer850" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_16.44_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.44: All my video work moves through these folder<span>s in order</span></p>&#13;
			<p><strong class="bold">Active</strong> is for working jobs, <strong class="bold">Completed</strong> is for finished jobs that haven't yet been archived, and <strong class="bold">Archived</strong> is for jobs that are now safe to delete. I don't actually delete them from working storage until I run a little low on space, and this has saved me more than once when a client has had a late thought about a recently completed job.</p>&#13;
			<p>Oh, and remember — archiving is not backup! You'll still need a backup strategy in place while you work. Online backup is a terrific option, and a local backup through something like Carbon <a id="_idIndexMarker1475"/>Copy Cloner will help you to sleep at night. And guess what — FCP X has a backup function built-in already. You probably won't need it often, but it's worth knowing about.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-496"><a id="_idTextAnchor518"/>Restoring from a backup</h2>&#13;
			<p>First, if you're restoring <a id="_idIndexMarker1476"/>an archived Project, that's pretty straightforward. Copy the Library back to your working drive, then open it up, do whatever you need to, and archive it again when you're done. But what if you accidentally destroy something important, and you quit FCP X before you can undo? That's usually easy too, because FCP X regularly makes backups of every Library it opens:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer851" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_16.45_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.45: It's easy to step back in time if something <span>goes wrong</span></p>&#13;
			<p>To roll back a Library to an older version of itself, choose <strong class="bold">File</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Open Library</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">From Backup</strong>. A dialog appears with a selection of previous versions of the Library in a menu. Choose one, click <strong class="bold">Open</strong>, and it'll open up with a timestamp in its name. Drag whatever you need from the old Library to the new one, and then close the old one down again — done. </p>&#13;
			<p>If your Library won't open at all, you can still recover. The default backup location is in your home directory, in Movies, in Final Cut Backups, so open that folder up now. (As an aside, if you're using cloud backups, this is a great folder to include.) In there, you'll find a subfolder for each Library you've ever worked on, and inside each of those, you'll see a collection of timestamped Libraries. None of these backups include media, so you'll need to locate the media from a backup of the media, either in a full copy of the Library with internal media, or an external media folder. Without media, backups don't take up a heap of space, but eventually, you might want to throw away the oldest ones:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer852" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_16.46_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.46: These backups can still be doubl<span>e-clicked </span>&#13;
if the original Library can't<span> be opened</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Double-click any Library to open it up, and then reconnect media if you need to. But don't work in that backup Library. It's a bad idea to make changes to a timestamped Library in the backups folder, not just because it's the wrong place to save a Library, but because the names will become very confusing. Instead, create a new Library and copy anything you want to that new Library.</p>&#13;
			<p>All that works <a id="_idIndexMarker1477"/>very well, but there's no easy way to force a backup to be made in the first place. It'll happen from time to time in the background, but you don't have any control over it. For such control, look to a<a id="_idIndexMarker1478"/> third-party app named simply <strong class="bold">Backups for Final Cut Pro</strong>. Let's hope you never need to use it.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-497"><a id="_idTextAnchor519"/>Review — Archiving your work</h2>&#13;
			<p>It's all done. You've exported, reimported, consolidated (even the Motion Templates!), and then trimmed down to save some space. You've safely copied it to a couple of archives, and then opened up an archive while the main drive was ejected to make sure it's fully self-contained. Maybe you've deleted it from your main storage already. Finally, maybe at some point you've had to restore an older version of your Library, from archive, or from your own system, but you figured it out.</p>&#13;
			<p>Finally, that's it. What's next?</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-498"><a id="_idTextAnchor520"/>What's next?</h1>&#13;
			<p>Indeed, what <em class="italic">is</em> next? Though there's been so much in this book already that your brain may have exploded, this section will give you a few jumping off points to consider what the editing experience might be like for you a few years from now. While the core editing experience is likely to remain the same, there's always going to be something new on the horizon, and it's good to keep an eye on what's possible.</p>&#13;
			<p>In this section you'll find out where you can learn even more about editing and discuss the issues with other editors. You'll find out a few places to discover and download new plug-ins, play with new technologies such as 360° editing — a really fun thing that hasn't quite taken off yet — and also learn about helper apps to make the editing process even more fun.</p>&#13;
			<p>The future's bright, and while it might not be evenly distributed, it's good to know what's coming next.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-499"><a id="_idTextAnchor521"/>Predicting future developments</h2>&#13;
			<p>A book is written at a point in time, and it's good to look ahead to what came recently, and what's coming soon. Video editing keeps changing, and you shouldn't expect to do one job for the rest of your life. Smartphones didn't really exist 20 years ago, and though we'll still be viewing moving images in another 20, who knows what we'll be viewing them on?</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-500"><a id="_idTextAnchor522"/>Augmented Reality (AR)</h3>&#13;
			<p>It's been long-rumored that Apple will introduce a set of AR glasses, and while that sounds interesting, it's unclear what part video will play. Maybe 3D video will have a comeback? Certainly, it might be worth considering how your video could be placed within a 3D environment.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-501"><a id="_idTextAnchor523"/>Wide Gamut Color and HDR</h3>&#13;
			<p>This is absolutely going to become more of a focus in the next few years; it's already here today. Phones and current Macs support Wide Gamut colors and HDR luminance ranges, and those ranges will only improve as time goes on. Today, most productions destined for online distribution just ignore these newer technologies, and while that's OK when most of the audience can't display them, that will change. Suddenly, your clients will want to show their work in brighter and more vivid colors than their competitors can, and then you'll want to be across it. High-end production is already there, the software is there, the hardware is there, and we humans will get &#13;
there eventually.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-502"><a id="_idTextAnchor524"/>New Codecs</h3>&#13;
			<p>H.264 is the most popular standard today, but HEVC supports HDR and makes smaller files; if it was quicker to encode HEVC then more people would use it, and in the future they will. H.266 and others are waiting in the wings, and change is certain — eventually.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-503"><a id="_idTextAnchor525"/>Apple Silicon Macs</h3>&#13;
			<p>Apple recently announced that its entire range of Macs will transition from Intel chips to Apple-made chips over the next 2 years, starting in late 2020. Not only will Final Cut Pro X be there on day 1, but it will also be a flagship app to show off the potential of the new systems. It's a fascinating time to be an editor on a Mac, and a lot could change eventually.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-504"><a id="_idTextAnchor526"/>Collaboration</h3>&#13;
			<p>It remains to be seen whether Apple will introduce an official collaboration workflow (as they already do with iCloud for iWork documents) but so far, this hasn't happened. Third parties have filled the gap for now, others may follow, and maybe we'll see more on this front.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-505"><a id="_idTextAnchor527"/>3D models may become more important</h3>&#13;
			<p>The latest version of Motion supports USDZ-based 3D models, and so there's the potential for a whole new world of 3D integration in video editing. These same models are usable in Apple's <strong class="bold">Augmented Reality</strong> (<strong class="bold">AR</strong>) applications, so you'll potentially be able to share assets between videos and AR experiences.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-506"><a id="_idTextAnchor528"/>360° video might take off</h3>&#13;
			<p>Working with 360° video is not just possible in FCP X, it's also a heap of fun. The first step is always to process your footage into equirectangular format, a 2:1 view that represents the entire sphere around the viewer. You can import those clips like any others, and work with them in a regular flat Project, or in a dedicated 360° Project — even a 3D 360° Project <em class="italic">since the 10.4.</em><em class="italic">9 release</em>.</p>&#13;
			<p>If you're delivering to a flat screen, you're in charge of where the viewer looks, but if you're delivering to a VR headset, the viewer is, and that's a challenge for many kinds of products. Your decision has consequences:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>In a regular Project, you'll choose which way to look, using dedicated 360° controls in <strong class="bold">Viewer</strong> and <span><strong class="bold">Inspector</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>In a 360° Project, the viewer chooses where to look, but you can simulate that process in a window or in a connected V<span>R headset.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Unfortunately, 360° video just hasn't taken off — yet? — as a delivery platform. Though it's really fun to shoot casual video with a 360° camera, as everything around the camera is captured, it's difficult to hide lights, to hide crew, and to direct. It's also hard to edit, to deliver, and to view, and is affected by issues such as bandwidth limitations, the limited distribution of headsets, and the basic difficulty of figuring out where people might be looking. Probably the biggest limitation is that if the camera moves, half of the audience in headsets will become nauseous:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer853" class="figure">&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.47: Across from Apple Park, as you might see it in a headset on the left, and the whole equirectangular view on<span> the right</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Most of those limitations go away when you use 360° footage in a regular Project because you can choose which way to look as you edit — and this is fun to work with:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer854" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_16.48_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.48: The same clip in a regular Project, forcing the viewer to look the<span> other way</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Used this way, a 360° camera is just an action camera you don't have to aim, but unfortunately this hasn't been a world-beating revolution. The lesser known 180° video (half the view, but in 3D) doesn't look like it's taking off either. Fingers crossed that a popular future piece of hardware changes things, because 360° video really is something new, but not enough people can experience it just yet.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-507"><a id="_idTextAnchor529"/>Cameras will get better</h3>&#13;
			<p>Right now, most new TVs and cameras are 4K, but a lot of lower end production still ends up at 1080p, mostly viewed on phones. Eventually that will shift, and when it does, camera manufacturers will be ready with far higher resolutions than anyone needs, like the newest 12K(!) camera from Blackmagic Design. We'll also see higher frame rates, increased dynamic range, and more besides. Computers will get faster, cameras will get better, and eventually, some of your audience will see better images.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-508"><a id="_idTextAnchor530"/><a id="_idTextAnchor531"/>Further learning</h2>&#13;
			<p>In any creative field, looking back on your old work can be bittersweet, first with nostalgia for times past, and then horror at how bad your work was back then. There's always more to learn, about how best to place that edit, or those lights, or that sound effect, and it's never been easier to find out information. Here are a few places to look.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-509"><a id="_idTextAnchor532"/>The official FCP X User Guide</h3>&#13;
			<p>In Final Cut Pro, choose <strong class="bold">Help</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Final Cut Pro X Help</strong> to make the official <strong class="bold">User Guide</strong> pop up in a small window that's always on top.</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

If something you've read here disagrees with something written there, trust it. The search field at the top of the <strong class="bold">Help</strong> menu is also a great way to locate a menu item.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-510"><a id="_idTextAnchor533"/>Online video training</h3>&#13;
			<p>I can't pretend to remain impartial here, as I've created many training courses for <a href="http://macProVideo.com">macProVideo.com</a>, but you'll find plenty of great paid video training courses for Final Cut Pro X and for Motion out there. While there's good free training out there too, the quality is more variable. While a book definitely has advantages — the information density here is far higher and you don't need to keep pausing — sometimes it's nice to see things in motion. We can all get along together.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-511"><a id="_idTextAnchor534"/>Online communities</h3>&#13;
			<p>Facebook has several Final Cut Pro X groups full of friendly, awesome people, Twitter has the #fcpx hashtag that's worth a search, and <a href="http://FCP.co">FCP.co</a> (run by Peter Wiggins) is the biggest independent news site. Keep in touch with all of these to stay up to date with the current news, for opinions, user stories, and more.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-512"><a id="_idTextAnchor535"/>Podcasts and live streams</h3>&#13;
			<p><strong class="bold">Final Cut Pro Radio</strong> (by Richard Taylor) and the <strong class="bold">FCP.co Live Show</strong> are (at the time of publication) the biggest regular shows where editors and other members of the community chat about the app, editing, and more. <strong class="bold">FCPX Grill</strong> (by Chris Fenwick) is on hiatus for now, but may return.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-513"><a id="_idTextAnchor536"/>Conferences</h3>&#13;
			<p>For the last few years, I've been a regular speaker at the excellent <strong class="bold">FCP X Creative Summit</strong>, held in Cupertino, California, organized by FMC and usually hosted by Jeff Greenberg, famous for his "inside voice." It's the best chance to hear what the world's best Final Cut editors have to say, meet up with the community, and talk directly to the development team at Apple. With luck, I'll be back at a future Summit soon.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-514"><a id="_idTextAnchor537"/>Complementary tools, plug-ins, and effects</h2>&#13;
			<p>There are many great products in the wider Final Cut Pro world, and this is not by any means an exhaustive list. None of these companies have paid for these listings, but I have used their products and can recommend them:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Motion</strong> (from Apple) is a fantastic complement to Final Cut Pro X, and the biggest bargain out there. It's the tool used to create the vast majority of the included and third-party transitions, effects, titles, and generators, so if you can get your head around it, you'll be able to explore a whole new world. Even if you never master all the depths of this great app, you'll easily be able to modify third-party content to put your own spin on it — and now with 3D models too! Awes<span>ome stuff.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Compressor</strong> (also from Apple) is a great app if you need to deliver content to a fussier audience with H.265, in specific data rates and containers, with watermarking, or simply to the iTunes Store. If you just put your content online, you probably won't need it, but it's a magic toolbox for ever<span>yone else.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><a href="http://commandpost.io">CommandPost</a>, a genius open source app from Chris Hocking and David Peterson, is the first thing you should install If you like to tinker. It extends Final Cut Pro X in all kinds of ways, enabling advanced workflows, automation, and even integration with external hardware such as MIDI controllers. If you've ever wanted to color correct using a hardware controller, here's how. Fantastic stuff, so send the developers a donation i<span>f you can:</span></li>&#13;

			<ul>&#13;
				<li><a href="http://intelligentassistance.com">Intelligent Assistance</a> makes a suite of helper apps that integrate with Final Cut Pro X, and if you're at the higher end of the market, you'll want to run straight to their translation and reporting solutions as they'll save you a ton of time and money. For live logging and transcription that ties into the edit, take a look at their <strong class="bold">Lumberja</strong><span><strong class="bold">ck System</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><a href="http://hedge.video">Hedge</a> offers software designed to import footage safely, but now also offers <strong class="bold">Postlab</strong>, the best collaboration solution to date. Definitely a great solution to remote editing as it lets you handle jobs for anyone on the planet, potentially a revolution in t<span>he making.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><a href="http://coremelt.com">CoreMelt</a> offers a suite of plug-ins for Final Cut Pro X, but I have to admit that I'm not impartial as I've made a lot of their training materials. If you want to track something around the screen, they have a great toolset available, and I've been using their <strong class="bold">Scribeomatic</strong> for automatic captioning too. CoreMelt also runs <a href="http://fcpxfree.com">fcpxfree.com</a>, a massive free directory of FCP X down<span>loadables.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><a href="http://motionvfx.com">motionVFX</a> offers not just a huge range of stylish bumper title designs, transitions, and color solutions, but also powerful custom plug-ins such as mO2 for 3D animation and other options for tracking. I've used many motionVFX templates to make clients happy over <span>the years.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><a href="http://lenofx.com">LenoFX</a> offers many packs of titles, generators, and transitions that can add pizzazz to your edits without being cheesy. When your clients demand more transitions or titles, head here for a pa<span>ck or two.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><a href="http://fxfactory.com">FxFactory</a> is a marketplace where many smaller developers sell their own effects and other plug-ins, and there's a huge variety of things here. Take a really good look around, but especially at the superb, genius <strong class="bold">Nodes</strong> by <strong class="bold">Yanobox</strong> and the quite excellent <strong class="bold">Hawa</strong><span><strong class="bold">iki Keyer</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-515"><a id="_idTextAnchor538"/>Review — What's next?</h2>&#13;
			<p>At this point, it would seem foolish to predict anything but change. At least you should now have an idea of the kinds of changes coming soon, of where you can learn more, and where you can go when you want to extend the capabilities of the software. Final Cut Pro X isn't going anywhere. Over time, it will add new features and continue to be the most efficient way to edit.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-516"><a id="_idTextAnchor539"/><a id="_idTextAnchor540"/>Summary</h1>&#13;
			<p>You've exported a compressed file, then many more, and finally had your edit approved. Maybe you did that many times today. Maybe you exported a higher quality version for someone else to work on, or collaborated with someone on another continent. Maybe you archived an older job, or brought one back to make a change, or used a third-party app to transcribe an interview or create a wild and crazy background.</p>&#13;
			<p>These might be the final steps in one edit, but they aren't your last. You've chosen a crazy industry with many niches to fall into, one which can make people happy or change minds, not just sell sugar water. Editing can be one of the most interesting challenges a creative mind can tackle, so get out there and make something amazing. You can.</p>&#13;

			<p>Thank you so much for reading this far. What seemed at first like a good idea during a global pandemic has become a monster, far larger and more detailed than I'd thought. While my first real editing gig was a Senior Video at school in 1991, and I've been teaching editing in Final Cut Pro since before it had an X, I'm still discovering features even now. There's always something new to learn, a new technique to conquer, a new effect to create.</p>&#13;
			<p>Video is becoming an ever-more important aspect of our lives, and we editors must adapt, delivering fresh kinds of moving images to a voracious audience on evolving devices and platforms. Simple shots and straight cuts have their place, but when they're not enough, they don't have to be. </p>&#13;
			<p>Final Cut Pro X is a key part of my creative toolkit. It's expanded what I'm able to do and how easily I'm able to do it, letting me edit at the speed of thought and have fun at the same time. It really is a great app, and I hope this book opens it up to you too. Get out there and edit!</p>&#13;

			<p>This book could not have happened without the contributions of many amazing people. Many thanks go to my editors at Packt (Sofi, Rakhi, and others) and technical reviewers (Chris Hocking and Kevin Luk) who all spotted several embarrassing errors. Any remaining mistakes are my responsibility; apologies in advance. Massive hugs and thanks go to my family, who've had to tolerate many late nights of writing over the last few months.</p>&#13;
			<p>It almost (but not quite) goes without saying that the entire team behind FCP X needs a huge round of applause too — kudos to you all. Much gratitude also to those who let me share screenshots of their work (or work I created for them) within this book. A special shout out goes to the music artist Ky, for whom I created a music video, and you can check out his audio track here: <a href="https://gyro.lnk.to/Gravitate">https://gyro.lnk.to/Gravitate</a>.</p>&#13;
			<p>Finally, thanks also to the talented editors who contributed quotes to open each chapter. They're all fantastic and worth tracking down online, but an extra thank you to Bradley Olsen, who created the awesome documentary <em class="italic">Off The Tracks</em>, and to Steve Bayes, who looked after Final Cut Pro X and ProRes from launch and for several years afterward — we're all in your debt.</p>&#13;
			<p>See you all online!</p>&#13;
