			<p class="author-quote">"To me, "driving" Final Cut Pro feels the same as taking control of an Autodesk Flame or Smoke — you truly feel like an artist and a musician, where the tools can keep up with your mental thought<span> process."</span></p>&#13;

			<p>With the picture looking good, this chapter shows how audio can be improved, or <em class="italic">sweetened</em>. To make sure you have some appropriate content to work with, we'll begin by recording an original voiceover. With those fresh voiceover clips in hand, we'll move on to audio adjustments. Starting with simple controls over volume, you'll discover more complex ways to animate (or automate) volume over time. Few recordings are perfect, so you'll find out how to remove problematic parts of the audio such as background hiss and hum, how to massage levels in subtle ways, and how to apply more complex audio effects for compression, advanced <strong class="bold">equalization</strong> (<strong class="bold">EQ</strong>), and special effects. Lastly, you'll discover the special tricks that Roles can perform when combined with Compound Clips. In bullet form, the following topics will be covered:</p>&#13;

			</ul>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">While you can often figure out a lot of visual techniques yourself, it takes more effort to become really good at audio. It's also true that something that sounds good to you might not sound so good to an audio engineer — they're hearing things wrong with your audio that you hadn't even considered. Some of that is down to their higher-quality speakers or headphones, and some of it is simply their better-trained ears. If you're new to audio, you've got more to learn than you thought.</p>&#13;
			<p>This chapter's goals are modest: to teach you how to make your audio sound better. Audio is a complex field that's not easy to explain in a static medium like a book, and while you might not finish this chapter as an expert, you'll hopefully leave it &#13;
better informed.</p>&#13;
			<p>Different types of productions will use very different kinds of audio, but a common addition to many productions is a voiceover narration, and it's also a good way to recap how split edits and fades can help. To get started, let's get your voice on a timeline, and then trim and fade it to fit.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-388"><a id="_idTextAnchor405"/>Recording and editing a voiceover</h1>&#13;
			<p>Here, you'll use the built-in <strong class="bold">Record Voiceover</strong> tool <a id="_idIndexMarker1119"/>to capture and<a id="_idIndexMarker1120"/> edit a voiceover, using whichever microphone you have available. Though we're <a id="_idIndexMarker1121"/>adding a narration to an edit already in place, workflows can vary widely — you might get a voiceover early or late in the process. However, postponing the official voiceover recording until the edit is near-final allows for late script changes, or limited availability of voice talent. Stay flexible.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">To obtain a recording suitable for final output, a high-quality microphone will need to be set up in a good environment for audio recording, and connected to a high-quality audio interface. For temporary recordings, you can use the built-in microphone in your Mac, but for professional work, you might need to invest in some extra gear, such as a high-end USB microphone or an XLR microphone with an external interface device. Some audio recorders (including many made by Zoom) can also function as external interfaces.</p>&#13;
			<p>As it's much easier to judge timing with a voiceover than without, a good workflow is to record a temporary <em class="italic">scratch</em> audio track yourself, based on the first draft of the script. You can edit the video to match that draft voiceover, and even suggest changes where the script doesn't quite match the video captured:</p>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.1: Scratch audio (the disabled clips highlighted here) helps you edit to a script before the final audi<span>o is ready</span></p>&#13;
			<p>After the final <a id="_idIndexMarker1122"/>script has been delivered to a voiceover artist, they can provide you with final audio files, and you can replace your draft voiceover in the edit. For other Projects, you <a id="_idIndexMarker1123"/>might actually provide the final voiceover yourself, perhaps adding it quite late in the process as we are here. Whatever works for you is fine, and to get started, choose <strong class="bold">Window</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Record Voiceover</strong> (or <strong class="bold">⌥⌘8</strong>):</p>&#13;

			<p>Clicking the big red button will add a new recording to the timeline at the current Playhead or Skimmer position, and it'll stop when <a id="_idIndexMarker1124"/>you click it again. The options here are mostly<a id="_idIndexMarker1125"/> self-explanatory:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Name</strong>: The name that will be given to the newly recorded voice<span>over clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Input</strong>: The recording device and channel(s) being used. Note that the "Stereo" option pictured is actually from a mono microphone, and this <span>is common.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Monitor</strong>: When <strong class="bold">On</strong>, you can hear the recording through your current output device. To avoid feedback, this should only be used when you're wearing h<span>eadphones.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Gain</strong>: A virtual volume knob that some devices offer — the interface referenced in the preceding illustration has hardware volume controls instead of vir<span>tual ones.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Countdown to record</strong>: If active, a visual and audible countdown plays before the official recordi<span>ng begins.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Mute Project while recording</strong>: If active, the current timeline is silenced while recording. Essential if not using h<span>eadphones.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Create Audition from takes</strong>: Combines multiple recordings at the same timeline position into a single Audition clip. Very useful if you are going to be recording multiple takes, as the different takes will end up as separate Audition picks in a si<span>ngle clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Event</strong>: The Event in the <strong class="bold">Library</strong> where the recording files will <span>be stored.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Role</strong>: The Audio Role that will be assigned to the recordings. Use <strong class="bold">Dialogue</strong>, or create a special Role or Subrole especially for voiceovers if you'd like to treat them di<span>fferently.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>To begin, you'll want to assemble a few clips in the timeline that could have a voiceover added. A more complex timeline with connected clips is fine; anything that would benefit from a narrator. With that ready, here are the simple steps:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Open <strong class="bold">Record Voiceover</strong>, and choose either your built-in microphone or another connected microphone from the <strong class="bold">I</strong><span><strong class="bold">nput</strong></span><span> menu.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Make sure that when you speak, the level meters are moving, and that they aren't too loud (peaking in the red on the right) or too quiet (barely moving in the green on <span>the left).</span><p>Higher quality audio devices <a id="_idIndexMarker1126"/>will record lower levels of noise. Recordings made with better devices can therefore be made much louder without also amplifying background hiss, so it's worth investing in good equipment and preparing your environment if you plan to use these recordings in your final delivery.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Click on a <a id="_idIndexMarker1127"/>spot in the timeline where a single sentence could<span> be added.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Click the red button (a circle) and then speak a few good words into your built-in microphone, leave a pause that's slightly too long, and then say a few more g<span>ood words.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press the red button (now a square) to stop <span>recording.</span><p>You'll see that your recording has been added to the timeline as a connected clip:</p></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer655" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_14.3_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.3: A voiceover recording with a pause in <span>the middle</span></p>&#13;
			<p>If you were now to use the <strong class="bold">Range Selection</strong> tool to select and then delete the unwanted section of the clip, you'd be left with two independent clips, and the second would be in the wrong spot:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer656" class="figure">&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.4: Deleting a part you don't want would create two indepen<span>dent clips</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Instead, while the voiceover is still selected, wrap it up first:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Press <strong class="bold">⌘G</strong> to wrap the voiceover clip inside a <span>Storyline.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">R</strong> to<a id="_idIndexMarker1128"/> switch to the <strong class="bold">Range Selection</strong> tool, select the <a id="_idIndexMarker1129"/>unwanted pause, and then pre<span>ss </span><span><strong class="bold">delete</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>Now, you'll see that the gap between the two good parts is closed as you delete the unwanted pause:</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.5: Deleting part of a clip inside a Storyline removes t<span>he gap too</span></p>&#13;
			<p>If there's any kind of audible glitch around the edit, perform the following steps:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Select the two clips and press <strong class="bold">⌥T</strong> to add a <span><strong class="bold">Crossfade</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Double-click the waveform to expand one or both sides of<span> the edit.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>If needed, drag the fade handles to fade the ends of the two clips where <span>they meet.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>If needed, change the type of fade by right-clicking each fa<span>de handle.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>If needed, trim the video component on either or both sides to overlap the two audio <span>waveforms:</span></li>&#13;

			<p>While a short <a id="_idIndexMarker1130"/>recording like this could simply be deleted in full and re-recorded, Storylines are a great way to clean up any longer recordings. One of my favorite techniques when<a id="_idIndexMarker1131"/> reading an entire script is to <strong class="bold">cough loudly</strong> whenever I make a mistake, and then repeat the problematic phrase before continuing. This makes it easy to spot the mistakes visually in the finished waveform, and I can select the bad parts with <strong class="bold">Range Selection</strong> and hit <strong class="bold">delete</strong> without even listening back to them:</p>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.7: The mistake and the cough are selected for eas<span>y deletion</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Professionals make mistakes too, and scripts are sometimes revised after voiceover recording is complete. It's therefore sometimes necessary to chop apart professional voiceovers in order to steal a fragment of audio (a word, a syllable, a few seconds of room tone) from one spot and re-insert it somewhere else. The rough workflow is as you'd expect:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Select and copy what you need from the so<span>urce clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Skim to where you want it <span>and paste.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>If you need to remove part of the original recording, <strong class="bold">Blade</strong> the destination to make an insertion point, and then drag the new audio fragment to <span>that spot.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Crossfade</strong> with <strong class="bold">⌥T</strong>, then trim, expand the audio, and adjust the fades to get the<span> job done.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>If you only need to add content, the new clip can be independently connected, but a Storyline (connected or Primary) is a big help if you'd prefer to close gaps as you work. </p>&#13;
			<p>Locations have their own sound, so don't forget to re-introduce room tone if you take out a few words and need to add a pause:</p>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.8: The not-quite-silent room tone clip below fills in the gap created by the <span>edit above</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Split edits<a id="_idIndexMarker1132"/> and fades <a id="_idIndexMarker1133"/>within a Storyline are a great way to make audio edits sound seamless, and there a few more techniques related to the <strong class="bold">Position</strong> tool back in <a href="B15343_10_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor271"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">Explore a Little: Compound Clips and Timelin</em><em class="italic">e Tricks</em>. </p>&#13;
			<p>By now, you'll be familiar with the editing part — chopping up clips should be second nature. You've also probably dragged audio volume levels up and down a little as part of the editing process. Next, you'll find out how to take those adjustments further.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-389"><a id="_idTextAnchor406"/>Adjusting volume levels</h1>&#13;
			<p>A clip's<a id="_idIndexMarker1134"/> volume, or audio level, is one of its most obvious properties. You can hear it, and you can see it (in a few forms) in the Browser, Inspector, and Timeline. Audio levels have been discussed in passing throughout the book so far, so while this shouldn't be unfamiliar, there's definitely more to learn.</p>&#13;
			<p>The unit used to describe audio volume is decibels, or <strong class="bold">dB</strong>, and it's used in both absolute and relative ways. However loud a clip is recorded, on a timeline it starts out at a neutral <strong class="bold">0 dB</strong>. Adjustments made to that clip are relative, going from a louder <strong class="bold">+12 dB</strong> all the way down to the silence of <strong class="bold">-∞</strong>:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer661" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_14.9_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.9: Audio volume levels on a<span> few clips</span></p>&#13;
			<p>When you <a id="_idIndexMarker1135"/>play back a timeline, it's quite different. All sound playing at a particular moment is summed together, creating an absolute value, also measured in dB, and visible in the <strong class="bold">Audio Meters</strong> (<strong class="bold">⇧⌘8</strong>). These dancing meters show the total audio at any point in time, with the previous peak recorded by thin lines on the meters and by numbers at the top of each channel:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer662" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_14.10_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.10: The full-size audio meters sit in the lower-ri<span>ght corner</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The output value should always remain negative, and its level should vary depending on your target output. The old rules for TV delivery stated that you should average around <strong class="bold">-12 dB</strong>, with the loudest sounds (peaks) at <strong class="bold">-6 dB</strong>. While that largely carried across to online delivery, there's no widely used standard, and some videos peak louder than this, around <strong class="bold">-3 dB</strong>. The only agreed standard is that you should never hit (or go past) <strong class="bold">0 dB</strong> because that will cause distortion.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">If you have to deliver to a platform with more stringent requirements, such as a streaming service, cinema ad system, or TV station, you'll have to follow their specifications closely. Standards vary internationally, but are likely to involve a more complex measurement of loudness over time. Many higher-end workflows perform final processing with a third-party application or plug-in (and leave the scope of this book), but it's possible to do it from FCP X, too.</p>&#13;
			<p>To get started, you <a id="_idIndexMarker1136"/>should first make a Workspace that makes audio easier to work with, and then we'll tackle the basic controls, before moving on to more complex animated controls.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-390"><a id="_idTextAnchor407"/>Creating a custom audio workspace</h2>&#13;
			<p>Way back in <a href="B15343_01_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor013"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Quick Start: An Introduction to FCP X</em>, you learned about Workspaces, which let<a id="_idIndexMarker1137"/> you instantly show or hide any combination of panes at whatever sizes you choose. As there's no pre-defined Audio Workspace, making one now is a good way to understand Workspaces better:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Press <strong class="bold">⌘0</strong> to start with the <strong class="bold">Default</strong> <span>Workspace.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">Window</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Show in Workspace</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Audio Meters</strong> or <span>press </span><span><strong class="bold">⇧⌘8</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Make the <strong class="bold">Audio Meters</strong> wider or narrower (as you wish) by dragging on the <span>left edge.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">⌥-click</strong> the green window control in the top-left corner of the interface to make sure the main window takes the maximum space<span> possible.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Double-click the title bar of the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> to expand that pane to the full height of t<span>he window.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Click the word <strong class="bold">Index</strong> to the left of the central gray bar, or press <strong class="bold">⇧⌘2</strong>, to open the <strong class="bold">Timel</strong><span><strong class="bold">ine Index</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>In <strong class="bold">Timeline Index</strong>, cl<span>ick </span><span><strong class="bold">Roles</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Save the workspace by choosing <strong class="bold">Window</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Workspaces</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Save Wor</strong><span><strong class="bold">kspace as</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Name your worksp<span>ace </span><span><strong class="source-inline">Audio</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>All done, and you should see your new custom Workspace in the <strong class="bold">Window</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Workspaces</strong> window. If you also want to increase the height of clip waveforms, use the settings in the <strong class="bold">Clip Appearance</strong> popup just to the left of the <strong class="bold">Effects</strong> icon to focus on audio waveforms while hiding<a id="_idIndexMarker1138"/> or shrinking video thumbnails:</p>&#13;

			<p>While you continue with the<a id="_idIndexMarker1139"/> rest of the chapter, leave your volume set at a consistent level so you can judge your changes as you go. If you have high-quality speakers, do use them, but remember that you should always preview your work on a variety of output devices, including built-in computer speakers, headphones, and mobile devices too.</p>&#13;
			<p>Though audio devices vary widely in their quality, you can always use an objective visual measure to judge volume: waveforms. More on those now.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-391"><a id="_idTextAnchor408"/>Understanding waveforms</h2>&#13;
			<p>The basics of audio levels <a id="_idIndexMarker1140"/>were mentioned in <a href="B15343_07_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor202"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Cover It Up: Connections, Cutaways, and Storylines</em>, and audio fade handles were covered in <a href="B15343_08_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor227"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Neaten the Edges: Trimming Techniques</em>. We'll take volume a little further here, and to understand everything, you should prepare a timeline with a person talking and some music behind it. If you've already edited a piece, that's fine, but just a plain single-camera shot and any audio track behind is fine too.</p>&#13;
			<p>Each clip that includes audio will show a waveform, just below its visual thumbnail (if any). As you'll remember, the <strong class="bold">Clip Appearance</strong> popup menu in <strong class="bold">Timeline</strong> can control how large the audio waveform is, and you might want to bump up the size of the audio waveforms now. The keyboard shortcuts <strong class="bold">⇧⌘plus</strong> and <strong class="bold">⇧⌘minus</strong> can help with this:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer665" class="figure">&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.13: Audio waveforms, larger than before and potentiall<span>y too loud</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The height of these waveforms<a id="_idIndexMarker1141"/> tells you how loud a particular piece of audio is. Gaps between sentences are clearly seen by a valley between peaks. Low-level noise is shown by the valleys never hitting the true floor. Peaks that turn yellow are getting loud, and peaks that turn red are probably too loud. Adjusting the volume levels will change the height of the waveforms and therefore their color. How do you make the peaks the right height? Let's cover this in the next section.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-392"><a id="_idTextAnchor409"/>Changing volume levels</h2>&#13;
			<p>On top of the audio <a id="_idIndexMarker1142"/>waveform, you'll see a line, and this line controls the volume. To adjust the line directly on the clip, you have a couple of options:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Drag the line up or down</strong> to move i<span>t quickly.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">⌘-drag the line up or down</strong>, moving it slowly (gearing down) for greater <span>precision.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>You can also use keyboard shortcuts to adjust one or more clips. Select them, and then press one of these:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">⌃plus</strong> to increase volu<span>me (+1 dB)</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">⌃minus</strong> to decrease volu<span>me (-1 dB)</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Those two commands live in the <strong class="bold">Modify</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Adjust Volume</strong> sub-menu, alongside:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Si</strong><span><strong class="bold">lence</strong></span><span> (</span><span><strong class="bold">-∞</strong></span><span>)</span></li>&#13;

			</ul>&#13;
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Absolute</strong> and <strong class="bold">Relative</strong> commands allow you to define a new value from scratch (Absolute) or expressed as a change from the existing value (Relative). Each command uses the timecode display below the Viewer to show the change that's going to occur, and like typing a timecode, you can type a positive or negative value, followed by <strong class="bold">return</strong>:</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.15: Volume controls and keyframing in the<span> Inspector</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Setting the overall level of a clip is an important first step, and if a single clip is to be the dominant sound at any one time, the waveforms should probably be peaking in yellow, but not moving to red. This color indication can vary between mono and stereo clips, so check the final output to be sure:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.16: This clip is getting a little lou<span>d in parts</span></p>&#13;
			<p>If you're hearing lots of audio (sound effects, music) at once, you can't judge the overall audio by an individual clip's waveform, and you'll have to watch <strong class="bold">Audio Meter</strong> to see the timeline's total audio level. It uses similar color markings, but the numbers are more important.</p>&#13;
			<p>No matter how you adjust <a id="_idIndexMarker1144"/>the volume, you'll almost certainly find a clip that is loud in some parts and quiet in others, and that's where you might need to set different volume levels over time.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-393"><a id="_idTextAnchor410"/>Changing volume levels over time</h2>&#13;
			<p>To change audio levels in<a id="_idIndexMarker1145"/> different regions, it's easiest to use the timeline. Volume changes, often called automation, are keyframe-based, and you can use the same keyframe techniques:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">⌥-click</strong> on the volume line to create a keyframe at a poin<span>t in time.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">⌥-click</strong> elsewhere on the volume line to create a keyframe at a different poin<span>t in time.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Move either keyframe up or down to change the volume at t<span>hat point.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Move either keyframe left or right to change its positio<span>n in time.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>Excess keyframes can be deleted with a right-click and choosing <strong class="bold">Delete</strong><strong class="bold"> Keyframe</strong>:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer669" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_14.17_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.17: Two keyframes allow music to fad<span>e down to </span>&#13;
a lower level and <span>stay there</span></p>&#13;
			<p>That technique works when you only want to make two keyframes, such as music that starts at full volume, and then fades down to background levels to make room for someone speaking. However, when you want to dip or raise the audio level temporarily, you'd have to make four keyframes. Let's take the example of music that dips underneath someone speaking (called <strong class="bold">ducking</strong>) and consider where the keyframes would be placed:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>At the start of the<a id="_idIndexMarker1146"/> change, to mark the start of the<span> fade down</span></li>&#13;
				<li>A second or two along, to mark the end of the<span> fade down</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Further along, at the start of the fade up, at the same level as the previou<span>s keyframe</span></li>&#13;
				<li>A second or two along, at the end of the fade up, at the same level as the firs<span>t keyframe</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>With four keyframes added, you would see this:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer670" class="figure">&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.18: Four keyframes to control the music underneath a perso<span>n speaking</span></p>&#13;
			<p>If you were to do this by manually placing keyframes, you'd have to <strong class="bold">⌥-click</strong> four times. While the keyframes are the outcome you want, there's a much easier way to do the same thing with <strong class="bold">Range </strong><strong class="bold">Selection</strong>:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Choose the <strong class="bold">Range Selection</strong><span> tool (</span><span><strong class="bold">R</strong></span><span>).</span></li>&#13;

				<li>Drag the volume line in<a id="_idIndexMarker1147"/> that region (or use any of the previously discussed te<span>chniques):</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.20: Four keyframes, created i<span>n one step</span></p>&#13;
			<p>This technique is faster and easier, and creates four keyframes that can be moved as needed. Move the outer keyframes outward to make the fade less abrupt, and move the line between the two central keyframes to adjust the lowered volume. Two keyframes can be selected and moved at once by moving the line connecting them.</p>&#13;
			<p>Do note that if you use the shortcuts (<strong class="bold">⌃plus</strong> or <strong class="bold">⌃minus</strong>) to change volume by <strong class="bold">1 dB</strong>, existing keyframes are retained, and moved up or down. To remove all keyframes and start again, use <strong class="bold">Modify</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Audio</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Absolute</strong> or <strong class="bold">Modify</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Audi</strong><strong class="bold">o</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Reset</strong>.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">Before you go crazy adjusting the volume a little bit here and a little bit there, in order to try to equalize a clip's volume across its entire length, know that some effects can do this (to some degree) for you, and we'll be looking at them soon. By all means use volume controls for manually ducking audio, but don't proceed with minor tweaks until you've applied some common audio effects.</p>&#13;
			<p>Finally, you'll remember from <a href="B15343_08_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor227"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Neaten the Edges: Trimming Techniques</em>, how to fade volume at the ends of a clip using audio fade handles. These provide a better way to start or end a<a id="_idIndexMarker1148"/> clip softly because they move with the clip edges as a clip is trimmed. Keyframes don't move unless you move them yourself:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer673" class="figure">&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.21: Hover over the edges of a clip's waveform to see the audio fade handles, and then drag t<span>hem inward</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Now that you have a handle on volume, you'll need to understand what's happening in a more complex workflow. The good news is that most simpler cameras will just record two channels, and they are likely to be detected correctly in most situations. However, if your devices record multiple channels in each clip, you'll want to pay attention to <strong class="bold">Audio Configuration</strong> before tackling the full audio workflow.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-394"><a id="_idTextAnchor411"/>Understanding Audio Configuration</h2>&#13;
			<p>At the bottom <a id="_idIndexMarker1149"/>of the <strong class="bold">Audio</strong> tab in the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong>, you'll see a section called <strong class="bold">Audio Configuration</strong>, and you may need to drag a small separator up to expose it. This section will help you make sure you use the right part of your recordings, which may have been a stereo recording, a mono recording, or something fancier. You can adjust panning (audio position in space, in <strong class="bold">Stereo</strong> or <strong class="bold">Surround</strong>) later on, but you'll need to make sure that your clips are tagged correctly first:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer674" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_14.22_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.22: Here's a Dual Mono clip in the Audio Configuration<span> section, </span>&#13;
with the separator line highlig<span>hted above</span></p>&#13;
			<p>With a clip selected, you'll see whether the clip is one of the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Mono</strong> (on<span>e channel)</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Dual Mono</strong> (two<span> channels)</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Stereo</strong> (two channels, left <span>and right)</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Reverse Stereo</strong> (two channels, right<span> and left)</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Multitrack</strong> (multiple channels, such as in a Multicam clip or from a multitrack<span> recorder)</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>One type of source can be<a id="_idIndexMarker1150"/> switched to another if it is incorrectly interpreted, and individual channels can be disabled if they aren't needed. For example, some devices record the same mono microphone input to two tracks at two different recording levels, one channel at a normal level, and the second channel at a lower level. If the recorded sound becomes too loud in the first channel, you can fall back to the second channel instead to avoid distortion. Audio such as this should be interpreted as <strong class="bold">Dual Mono</strong>, and the loudest clean channel should be used. So, if it was incorrectly tagged as <strong class="bold">Stereo</strong>, manually interpret it as <strong class="bold">Dual Mono</strong>, and then turn off the channel you don't need with the appropriate checkbox as shown:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer675" class="figure">&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.23: The first track was fine, so we don't need <span>the second</span></p>&#13;
			<p>If this clip had been <a id="_idIndexMarker1151"/>interpreted as <strong class="bold">Stereo</strong> and no components deleted, all the audio will be slightly panned to the left, as the first channel was louder. This is a surprisingly common problem online, so make sure that you check your final output on a stereo speaker. And if your audio is Stereo but the mics are transposed (each in the wrong channel), you can choose <strong class="bold">Reverse Stereo</strong> now to fix it.</p>&#13;
			<p>With a single speaker, things will be pretty simple. However, more complex Multicam audio situations can require a little extra work, and here's how you can manage &#13;
the process.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-395"><a id="_idTextAnchor412"/>Adjusting multiple audio channels</h2>&#13;
			<p>In most Multicam or <a id="_idIndexMarker1152"/>multi-track recordings, you'll probably use just a single channel of audio — whatever sounds best. But if the chosen microphone has an issue at some point, how do you switch to a backup? And how do you actively incorporate audio from multiple microphones at the same time, as in a multi-person audio recording? There are a few extra tricks for dealing with audio components in the timeline.</p>&#13;
			<p>You'll remember that double-clicking on an audio waveform expands audio, moving it below the video and allowing for split edits. When there's more than one channel, here's an extra trick:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">⌥-double-click</strong> an audio waveform to expand audio c<span>omponents.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Now you can see all the audio components at the same time. To control each channel separately, you can use the volume controls already discussed, adding keyframes and so on, or explore an additional neat trick. With a multi-component clip on the timeline, and audio components visible<a id="_idIndexMarker1153"/> and active, perform the following steps:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Switch to the <strong class="bold">Range Selection</strong><span> tool (</span><span><strong class="bold">R</strong></span><span>).</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Select part of one of the audio waveforms that you want to enable o<span>r disable.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">V</strong> to turn that se<span>ction off:</span><div id="_idContainer676" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_14.24_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.24: With some sections enabled and other<span>s disabled</span></p><p>The section of audio goes dark, just as it would if the entire track was disabled. Pressing <strong class="bold">V</strong> again will bring it back if you change your mind. But let's soften those transitions first.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>At the edge of the disabled audio section, hover near the volume line until you see the teardrop-shaped audio fade <span>indicator.</span><p>That's right — the audio fades that appear at the edges of clips work here too.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Drag the teardrop audio fade indicator sideways, toward the enabled section, to add an a<span>udio fade:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer677" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_14.25_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.25: With fades applied, and some overlap<span>ping areas</span></p>&#13;
			<p>If the edges of any of these regions are in the wrong place, they can be rolled, and you'll see the roll cursor pop up as you hover over the edges:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer678" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_14.26_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.26: Edges in the wrong place? Just roll them to where you<span> want them</span></p>&#13;
			<p>This technique allows you to jump between active microphones or use both at once. This way, you can record two or more subjects independently, and then use as many or as few channels as you wish in the final edit. There's no need to blade, no need to detach audio, and it's a softer approach than simply switching audio along with video in a Multicam clip.</p>&#13;
			<p>One minor gotcha, though. As you <a id="_idIndexMarker1154"/>work with multiple channels at once, remember that if you hover over a single channel and then tap the <strong class="bold">spacebar</strong>, you'll only hear the channel that the red Skimmer is currently visible on. To hear everything, first hover in the timeline bar or in empty space nearby to let the Skimmer cover all channels:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer679" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_14.27_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.27: With the red Skimmer passing through all channels, it's a<span>ll audible</span></p>&#13;
			<p>For a more complex edit, with multiple subjects visible and audible at once, you may also wish to position them within a stereo soundfield. That means controlling <em class="italic">panning</em> as well as volume, and here's how.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-396"><a id="_idTextAnchor413"/>Adjusting panning</h2>&#13;
			<p>Most Projects use <strong class="bold">Stereo</strong> sound, and so<a id="_idIndexMarker1155"/> this is simply the positioning of each audio source in a left-right one-dimensional space. The most common workflow is to ignore this entirely: mono microphones sit in the middle, and stereo background music means that there's a little liveliness in the stereo soundfield. But you can do more, by positioning mono microphones in stereo space. Some cameras will record stereo audio, which is good for environmental sound (atmosphere), but most dedicated microphones are mono, and end up dead center by default.</p>&#13;
			<p>If you want to position your subject in space more flexibly, look for a <strong class="bold">Pan</strong> control below <strong class="bold">Audio</strong> enhancements in the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong>. Show it if necessary, and then follow these steps:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Choose the appropriate channel setup in <strong class="bold">Audio Configuration</strong>, setting <strong class="bold">Mono</strong> for one channel or <strong class="bold">Dual Mon</strong><span><strong class="bold">o</strong></span><span> for two.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>For <strong class="bold">Dual Mono</strong> only, in the individual channels below, select the channel you wish to adjust by click<span>ing on it.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Under <strong class="bold">Pan</strong>, choose <strong class="bold">Stereo Left/Right</strong>, and then an <strong class="bold">Amount</strong> u<span>nderneath.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>Zero is center, negative values pan left, and positive values pan right; each channel can be set to a separate position in space to roughly approximate a sound source's position. This isn't strictly necessary in most productions, but it's a nice touch. Panning can also be keyframed, using the standard controls, to accommodate movement within a frame:</p>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.28: This clip is now positioned a little to<span> the right</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Now, if you want to get really fancy, and your delivery platform can handle it, consider delivering to a surround setup. Your Project can be set to <em class="italic">5.1 surround</em> in its settings, and then you can position any clip in not just 1D space, but 2D space, all around the viewer:</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.29: Switch your Project to Surround with the Inspector's Modify button here — fun to use, but harder <span>to deliver</span></p>&#13;
			<p>At a simple level, you can<a id="_idIndexMarker1156"/> switch panning to <strong class="bold">Basic Surround</strong> and then drag the puck to wherever you'd like it to come from. If you don't have time, use some quick fixes:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Dialogue</strong>: Positioned mostly toward fr<span>ont center</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Ambience</strong>: Positioned more toward the surround (rear<span>) speakers</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Music</strong>: Positioned evenly across the surro<span>und space:</span></li>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.30: The Dialogue surround panning mode emphasizes the fro<span>nt speaker</span></p>&#13;
			<p>And if you're animating a pan, pay more attention to what the <strong class="bold">Amount</strong> control does. Choosing one of these options might not appear to do anything, but the Amount slider behaves very differently in each of<a id="_idIndexMarker1157"/> the options here:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Basic Surround</strong>: A left/right pan within surr<span>ound space</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Create Space</strong>: More of a central/front bias; uses more of the surround fi<span>eld at </span><span><strong class="source-inline">100</strong></span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Dialogue</strong>: <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> means no effect, <strong class="source-inline">100</strong> is all the way to fr<span>ont center</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Music</strong>: Evenly spread around, uses more of the surround fi<span>eld at </span><span><strong class="source-inline">100</strong></span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Ambience</strong>: <strong class="source-inline">100</strong> pushes the audio to surround only, and <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> returns it to the middle of<span> the space</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Circle</strong>: Audio comes from a specific area in <span>360° space</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Rotate</strong>: Any existing audio position is rotated in <span>360° space</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Back to Front</strong>: Moves from the back to the front of the surr<span>ound space</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Left Surround to Right Front</strong>: Like a bullet shot, from behind on the left flying past you to ahead of you on<span> the right</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Right Surround to Left Front</strong>: Like a bullet shot, from behind on the right flying past you to ahead of you o<span>n the left</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>These options are pretty cool, but as you can't currently deliver surround sound to popular video sharing sites, most people won't hear it. Until more delivery methods become available, these techniques are only important for fancier deliverables. Support is improving, so don't be surprised if surround becomes more popular over time:</p>&#13;

			<p>The audio volume <a id="_idIndexMarker1158"/>controls were a great place to start, and keyframes let you take it a lot further.

By the end of this section, you'll understand what can be done here, as well as what can be done better elsewhere. Note that if an audio clip has multiple components, you may need to select a single component (by clicking on it) before you can adjust the options shown here.</p>&#13;
			<p>At the top of the list is <strong class="bold">Equalization</strong>, often known as EQ, and that's followed by <strong class="bold">Audio Analysis</strong> and its <strong class="bold">Loudness</strong>, <strong class="bold">Noise Removal</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Hum Removal </strong>subsections. These are by no means the only ways to make these changes to clips, but they are simple, and built in:</p>&#13;

			<p>In fact, if you<a id="_idIndexMarker1160"/> check <strong class="bold">Analyze and fix audio problems</strong> on import, some of these options may already be active, and if that's the case, turn them all off so that you're &#13;
starting fresh:</p>&#13;

			<p>Bear in mind that these are always the first things applied to a clip, before any other audio effects, and, as you'll find out, that can sometimes be a limitation. Now it's time to dip into EQ.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-399"><a id="_idTextAnchor416"/>Equalization</h2>&#13;
			<p>Every sound is<a id="_idIndexMarker1161"/> made up of waves traveling at specific frequencies. A low frequency (bass) <a id="_idIndexMarker1162"/>sound is deep, like a bass drum or a tuba, while a high frequency (treble) sound is a sharp, piercing noise like a violin or a child's scream. While many headphones advertise a frequency range of something like 20–20,000 Hz, most humans can't hear that full range, and most speakers can't reproduce it anyway. But that's OK, there's plenty to work with.</p>&#13;
			<p><strong class="bold">Equalization</strong> lets you increase the volume of certain frequencies while decreasing others, enhancing some kinds of sounds while making others less audible. You can use EQ to make one clip sound a little more like another, to emphasize or de-emphasize an aspect of a sound, or to do something special. One neat trick is to edit the EQ for a piece of music, turning down the frequencies that speech uses. That makes speech placed over that music sound clearer, and<a id="_idIndexMarker1163"/> means that any volume change (ducking) doesn't <a id="_idIndexMarker1164"/>need to be as obvious:</p>&#13;

			<p>While the Equalization section of Audio Enhancements does allow for a range of presets as well as full manual controls, there are more advanced EQ options in Audio Effects, and we'll get to those soon. We're just getting started.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-400"><a id="_idTextAnchor417"/>Manual EQ</h3>&#13;
			<p>To begin, you'll want to<a id="_idIndexMarker1165"/> hear what a clip sounds like, before you add any EQ. And<a id="_idIndexMarker1166"/> if anything is playing at the same time, it's a good idea to focus on just the one clip. To hear the clip on its own, without background music:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Select a clip in the<span> timeline.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press the <strong class="bold">Solo</strong> icon, the headphones between <strong class="bold">Audio Skimming</strong> and <strong class="bold">Snapping</strong>, or<span> press </span><span><strong class="bold">⌥S</strong></span><span>.</span><p>Now, only that clip can be heard, and all other audio is grayed out and disabled. You can click the <strong class="bold">Solo</strong> button once again to bring it back.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Activate looping by choosing <strong class="bold">View</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Playback Loop Playback</strong> (<strong class="bold">⌘</strong><strong class="bold">L</strong>) and making sure the menu option i<span>s checked.</span><p>When looping is active, you can also see a ring around the <strong class="bold">playback</strong> button below the  Viewer.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Play just the selected clip by pressing <span><strong class="bold">/</strong></span><span> (slash).</span><p>This is the <strong class="bold">Play Selection</strong> command. Listen to the clip once or twice to make sure you know what it sounds like. If <a id="_idIndexMarker1167"/>the clip is too long, you can use the <strong class="bold">Range Selection</strong> (<strong class="bold">R</strong>) tool to select just a range, and then press <strong class="bold">/</strong> once again.</p><p>Now it's time to experiment. Currently, the EQ is <em class="italic">Flat</em>, or deactivated.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>As the region plays, try several different<a id="_idIndexMarker1168"/> options from the <strong class="bold">Equalization</strong> menu, and listen for the di<span>fferences.</span><p>You should be able to clearly hear the difference between opposing settings, such as <strong class="bold">Treble Boost</strong> and <strong class="bold">Treble Reduce</strong>, but it's easiest to see them visually, and there's an interface for that.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Push the small button next to the <strong class="bold">Equaliza</strong><span><strong class="bold">tion</strong></span><span> menu.</span><p>This activates the advanced equalization window, which looks like this:</p></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer687" class="figure">&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.35: Treble Boost pushes up the higher-end f<span>requencies</span></p>&#13;
			<p>At the top left of this window, you can see a menu from which you can choose the same presets as before. In the body of the window, you can adjust pucks corresponding to any of these frequencies independently. It's <a id="_idIndexMarker1169"/>also possible to drag a selection across multiple bands and then adjust selected pucks together, but be careful: to select multiple bands this way, you have to start your drag on one of the lines, not one of the pucks, and not the empty space between the lines. Instead, it's easier to <strong class="bold">right-click and drag across all the pucks at once</strong> to set new values instantly.</p>&#13;
			<p>To the bottom right of the<a id="_idIndexMarker1170"/> window, the <strong class="bold">Flatten EQ</strong> button resets the panel, and the pop-up menu allows you to switch between <em class="italic">10 bands</em> as shown previously, and a more precise <em class="italic">31 bands</em> option shown next. This lets you be more selective about which frequencies are adjusted, but now that you have more sliders to play with, it can take more effort to get the job done: </p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer688" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_14.36_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.36: The 31 band EQ has many pucks to adjust, so right-click and drag to set them al<span>l at once </span></p>&#13;
			<p>What's the goal? Trying to remove unwanted sounds, and enhancing the good ones. If there's a rustle, or a hum, or mic handling noise, you can try reducing sliders where you think the frequencies are, and<a id="_idIndexMarker1171"/> moving to other frequencies until you isolate the<a id="_idIndexMarker1172"/> problem. It's not always possible to invisibly remove a sound unless it's very localized to a particular frequency, but sometimes it works wonders.</p>&#13;
			<p>This window is a good place to start with EQ, but for more powerful adjustments, including a visual display of the frequencies being used in a particular clip, you'll want to use specific advanced audio effects instead. We'll look at them soon, but there's a unique trick to the built-in EQ feature, called <strong class="bold">Match EQ,</strong> that's worth a quick look.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-401"><a id="_idTextAnchor418"/>Match EQ</h3>&#13;
			<p>The Match EQ <a id="_idIndexMarker1173"/>feature<a id="_idIndexMarker1174"/> provides a very quick way to make two clips sound more similar by applying a custom EQ. Like the <strong class="bold">Match Color</strong> feature, it can't be turned down, though it can be turned off. You'll need two audio clips: a target clip, and a source clip. For good results, the two recordings should share some similarities but not all; they could feature the same person in two different environments, or the same person through two different recording devices. With those two clips on a timeline:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Select the target clip you want <span>to change.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">Match</strong> from the<a id="_idIndexMarker1175"/> EQ menu or <strong class="bold">Match Audio</strong> from the <strong class="bold">Audio Enhancements</strong> menu (the magic wand icon at the lower left of th<span>e </span><span><strong class="bold">Viewer</strong></span><span>).</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Click on the so<span>urce clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Click <strong class="bold">Apply Match</strong> to<a id="_idIndexMarker1176"/> apply t<span>he effect:</span><div id="_idContainer689" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_14.37_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.37: The Match EQ in progress doesn't show much in th<span>e Viewer, </span>&#13;
but follow the instruction<span>s below it</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Play the selected cl<span>ip with </span><span><strong class="bold">/</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>With any luck, you'll be able to hear the difference, and also hear that the selected clip now sounds more similar to the source clip. To try again, you can repeat the same steps, or press the new <strong class="bold">microphone icon</strong> that has appeared to the far right of the Match menu to pick a new source clip.</p>&#13;
			<p>Pressing the button<a id="_idIndexMarker1177"/> immediately to the right of the Match menu brings up a <a id="_idIndexMarker1178"/>new window, where the Match EQ effect is shown, and you'll see that this is a more complex adjustment than a simple band-based EQ:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer690" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_14.38_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.38: The Match EQ dialog, with two quite different clips<span> as source</span></p>&#13;
			<p>I find that this feature does do a decent job quite quickly and, if nothing else, it's useful as a starting point for further work. To apply a Match EQ from one clip to another, you can copy it and then select <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Paste Effects</strong> or <strong class="bold">Paste Attributes</strong>, just as with video effects.</p>&#13;
			<p>After EQ, the other Audio Enhancements are worth a look, even if you don't use them often, and we'll look at them in top-down order.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-402"><a id="_idTextAnchor419"/>Audio Analysis</h2>&#13;
			<p>The next<a id="_idIndexMarker1179"/> three sections (<em class="italic">Loudness</em>, <em class="italic">Noise Removal</em>, and <em class="italic">Hum Removal</em>) can be activated automatically, if analysis deems it necessary. Personally, I prefer to leave this off and apply these fixes manually as required, but if you want to try the fully automatic experience, click the <strong class="bold">Magic Wand</strong> button next to <strong class="bold">Audio Analysis</strong>. That <a id="_idIndexMarker1180"/>button analyzes the clip and turns the next few sections on if needed, and in fact, you can do this analysis during the import process if you're in a hurry:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer691" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_14.39_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.39: Was the noise problem here magically fixed<span>? Doubtful</span></p>&#13;
			<p>If a problem is <a id="_idIndexMarker1181"/>detected but you decide to turn the correction off, you'll now see a <a id="_idIndexMarker1182"/>yellow or red warning symbol next to that area. Easy to use, convenient… so why don't I like to use this? Read on to find out more about these adjustments.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-403"><a id="_idTextAnchor420"/>Loudness</h2>&#13;
			<p>This is actually more of a<a id="_idIndexMarker1183"/> complex effect than you might think; it doesn't just turn up the volume, but applies <em class="italic">compression</em>, turning up quiet parts of the audio to make the audio level more consistent. This reduces the dynamic range of the clip, and it's a key part of the audio processing workflow. However, if there's any noise in your recording, you should remove that noise before applying this effect, and unfortunately, <strong class="bold">Loudness</strong> is applied early, straight after EQ. Therefore, if there's any noise or hiss in your recording, this feature can amplify it, and make it harder to remove — a limitation of its early processing position. For more advanced workflows, you'll want to use Audio Effects instead.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-404"><a id="_idTextAnchor421"/>Noise Removal</h2>&#13;
			<p>Noise and <a id="_idIndexMarker1184"/>hiss are<a id="_idIndexMarker1185"/> incredibly common, and include both self-noise (from cheaper microphones) and background noises (air conditioning, traffic, and so on). While this feature does remove noise, it can reduce the quality of what's left, leaving audible artifacts, like a robot talking underwater:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer692" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_14.40_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.40: At 27%, this shouldn't sound too robotic, but you might still hear <span>some noise</span></p>&#13;
			<p>By default, this <a id="_idIndexMarker1186"/>will be set to 50%, and I find that it can cause problems at more than 30%. Personally, I <a id="_idIndexMarker1187"/>use a third-party noise reduction plugin later in the process because this feature is good, but not great.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-405"><a id="_idTextAnchor422"/>Hum Removal</h2>&#13;
			<p>With good<a id="_idIndexMarker1188"/> production<a id="_idIndexMarker1189"/> practices, you won't need this. From time to time, electrical interference (often near cables) can cause an audible hum at the frequency of the electrical system in your country (50 Hz for PAL territories, 60 Hz for NTSC territories). If this happens to you, choosing the correct frequency will remove it nicely. Note that there's an EQ option that does a similar job:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer693" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_14.41_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.41: The Hum Reduction EQ option if you want mo<span>re control</span></p>&#13;
			<p>However, the EQ option, at 64 Hz, is a little less specific than the dedicated <strong class="bold">Hum Removal</strong> option, which targets 50 Hz or 60 Hz.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-406"><a id="_idTextAnchor423"/>Review — Audio enhancements</h2>&#13;
			<p>As a quick fix, these <a id="_idIndexMarker1190"/>options are appreciated, but if you've got more time, their limitations become obvious. Match EQ is useful for a rogue recording or two, and the other EQ options are useful for simple tasks. Still, just as I don't trust a camera's automatic white balance, I'd be very wary of trusting my final output to fully automatic audio analysis. Loudness, Noise Removal, and Hum Removal are important, but you might not find all the controls you need here.</p>&#13;
			<p>To take things further, you may wish to control the order in which operations are performed. For this, along with far more subtle controls, audio effects are the way to go. Many are built in, and they are easy to use.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-407"><a id="_idTextAnchor424"/>Applying and using audio effects</h1>&#13;
			<p>To <a id="_idIndexMarker1191"/>make audio <a id="_idIndexMarker1192"/>sound clearer, or make voice more robotic, or to compress dynamic range, or distort it in all kinds of crazy ways, you need audio effects, and you'll learn about many of them here. As you might expect, audio effects function much like video effects, and are found at the bottom of the same <strong class="bold">Effects Browser</strong> interface pane. There's a wild variety of included effects (including many from Apple's Logic Pro) and third-party effects are also supported, so you'll be able to cover most tasks.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">Audio effects can be added to individual clips, to components of clips, or to many clips at once. While we'll approach this simply at first, applying effects to entire clips, you'll find out how to deal with more complex workflows in the following section, <em class="italic">Using Roles with audio</em>.</p>&#13;
			<p>In this section, you'll discover the basics of audio effect editing, find out how to access some of the more adventurous interfaces, find out what your goals should be when sweetening audio, and use some built-in effects as a starting point to process voice. We'll start with the basics, and it should feel familiar after the last chapter.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-408"><a id="_idTextAnchor425"/>Adding audio effects</h2>&#13;
			<p>To get started, you'll <a id="_idIndexMarker1193"/>need to see the Effects Browser:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Show the <strong class="bold">Effects Browser</strong> by pressing <strong class="bold">⌘5</strong> or by clicking the icon second from the right in the central<span> gray bar.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>As you'll remember, in the sidebar you'll see <strong class="bold">Video </strong>effects on top and <strong class="bold">Audio</strong> &#13;
effects beneath:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.42: The Levels effects within the Ef<span>fects pane</span></p>&#13;
			<p>It's simple to look only at audio effects, or to look at a specific category:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Click <strong class="bold">All</strong>, just under <strong class="bold">Audio</strong>, to see all the audio effects in the pane to <span>the right.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Click any category name to see only the audio effects in that<span> category.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Audio effects can, of course, be previewed before being applied, but you'll need to activate <strong class="bold">Audio Skimm</strong><strong class="bold">ing</strong> first:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">If it's not already active, press <strong class="bold">⇧S</strong> to activate <strong class="bold">Audio</strong><span><strong class="bold"> Skimming</strong></span><span>.</span><p>The Audio Skimming icon will light up blue when it's turned on.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Hover (skim) over an effect to hear that effect applied to the sele<span>cted clip.</span><p>As with video effects, this is only a preview of the default setting of an effect.

Using a voice clip you recorded earlier would be perfectly appropriate.</p></li></ul></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">⌥-click</strong> on a clip to<a id="_idIndexMarker1194"/> select it and move the Playhead to t<span>hat point.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Effects</strong> pane, click on the <strong class="bold">Echo</strong><span> category.</span><p>Within this category, you'll find headings separating three types of effects: <strong class="bold">Final Cut</strong>, <strong class="bold">Logic</strong>, and <strong class="bold">macOS</strong>. While it doesn't matter where an effect came from, the Logic-based effects tend to be more sophisticated, and with more extravagantly diverse interfaces. Let's throw on something crazy first.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Drag the <strong class="bold">Delay Designer</strong> effect to <span>your clip.</span><p>This is one of the <strong class="bold">Logic</strong> effects, and you'll be able to clearly hear what it does.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Play the clip back by p<span>ressing </span><span><strong class="bold">/</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong>, without stopping playback, choose one of the other options from the extensive <strong class="bold">Pr</strong><span><strong class="bold">eset</strong></span><span> menu:</span><div id="_idContainer695" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_14.43_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.43: Melodic patterns do soun<span>d like fun</span></p><p>There are sufficient options here to keep you busy for a few minutes, and some of these options sound awesome.</p></li>&#13;

				<li>Explore the dialog, switching tabs at the top, clicking and dragging, and figuring out what some of the se<span>ttings do.</span><p>Everything can be<a id="_idIndexMarker1196"/> tweaked, but to explore even this one effect in depth would take some time; there's a lot going on. Be careful, as some settings (such as the <strong class="bold">Feedback</strong> option to the right) can produce deafening results. If you do find settings that you'd like to use again, you can save them.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>From the <strong class="bold">Preset</strong> menu in the top-left corner, choose <strong class="bold">Save </strong><span><strong class="bold">Preset...</strong></span><span>:</span><div id="_idContainer697" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_14.45_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.45: The presets are at the effect-level for Logic and mac<span>OS effects</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Type a name and then p<span>ress </span><span><strong class="bold">Save</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>Not all effects work in the same way. While the <strong class="bold">Logic</strong> and <strong class="bold">macOS</strong> effects include their own presets in their menus, the <strong class="bold">Final Cut</strong> audio effects don't. This is because they are a little like native FCP X <strong class="bold">Effects Presets</strong>; each one combines one or more individual audio effects to create a pre-determined outcome. The individual components can be tweaked, but you're stuck with the built-in preset options. In some cases, the preset choices will actually change the underlying effects.</p>&#13;
			<p>If you'd like to explore <a id="_idIndexMarker1197"/>these effects, perform the following steps: </p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">⌥-click</strong> on another clip to select it and move the Playhead to t<span>hat point.</span></li>&#13;

			<p>You'll see that the <a id="_idIndexMarker1199"/>underlying effect (and the visual display) changes from <strong class="bold">AUDelay</strong> to <strong class="bold">Distortion</strong>, an effect from a different category that nevertheless can produce an echo. There are many dials to play with here, and it's worth experimenting with them. When you're done, close the window.</p>&#13;
			<p>While most effects do include a <strong class="bold">User Presets</strong> system, the <strong class="bold">Final Cut</strong> group of audio effects do not. To access presets for the individual effects inside one of these (such as AUDelay or AUDistortion inside Echo Delay), you'll have to find those original effects in the <strong class="bold">Logic</strong> or <strong class="bold">macOS</strong> sections instead.</p>&#13;
			<p>You can tweak an effect's manual settings no matter how you applied it, and you can create your own combinations of multiple effects, too.</p>&#13;
			<p>To re-use the current clip's effects, including all current parameters, you should click the <strong class="bold">Save Effects Preset</strong> button at the bottom of the Inspector, as you did for video effects in the previous chapter:</p>&#13;

			<p>In this section, I'll <a id="_idIndexMarker1201"/>take you through some of the most useful standalone effects and effect combinations. If you'd like to add these to one or more of your clips, go ahead, but just remember the standard effect rules:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Click the checkbox next to an effect's name to turn it <span>on or off.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>To delete an effect, select it by clicking on its title bar and then pre<span>ss </span><span><strong class="bold">delete</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;

			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Along the way, we'll explore some of the goals you should keep in mind when sweetening audio.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-410"><a id="_idTextAnchor427"/>Distortion</h3>&#13;
			<p>Honestly, all these<a id="_idIndexMarker1202"/> options are fun, but none of them make your audio sound <em class="italic">better</em>. Instead, they all make the audio sound much worse, but in very interesting and configurable ways:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.51: Ringshifter is a fun, crazy way to make things sou<span>nd strange</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Final Cut</strong> effects here imitate outdated tech such as radios and walkie-talkies, while if you're looking for a fun <strong class="bold">Logic</strong> interface, <strong class="bold">Ringshifter</strong> is your friend.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-411"><a id="_idTextAnchor428"/>Echo</h3>&#13;
			<p><strong class="bold">Echo Delay</strong> (as you've seen) is a <a id="_idIndexMarker1203"/>simple option that works well, and <strong class="bold">Delay Designer</strong> has the craziest interface:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer704" class="figure">&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.52: Many Logic effects have a modern, clean interface, like St<span>ereo Delay</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The other <strong class="bold">Logic</strong> effects here use simple dials and sliders, and should be straightforward to decipher.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-412"><a id="_idTextAnchor429"/>EQ</h3>&#13;
			<p>This is where it gets pretty <a id="_idIndexMarker1204"/>interesting, as the <strong class="bold">Channel EQ</strong> effect at the top and <strong class="bold">Linear Phase EQ</strong> under <strong class="bold">Logic</strong> provide a much more interactive way to look at your audio. There are many useful presets, but choose <strong class="bold">05 Voice</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Voice-Over EQ</strong> for a quick voiceover fix. During playback, you can click the <strong class="bold">Analyzer</strong> button in the lower-left corner to see the active frequencies in a live graph (pre- or post-effect):</p>&#13;

			<p>Each adjustment point on the<a id="_idIndexMarker1205"/> graph can be pushed up or down manually, or by dragging the numbers under each one. For a simpler, more traditional take, try <strong class="bold">Fat EQ</strong>:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer706" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_14.54_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.54: Fat EQ has an older look, and it's a little s<span>impler too</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Final Cut</strong> effects here provide useful presets to remove high or low frequencies, making use of the <strong class="bold">macOS</strong> or <strong class="bold">Logic</strong> effects. Technical tasks such as high-pass and low-pass are well catered for here.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-413"><a id="_idTextAnchor430"/>Levels</h3>&#13;
			<p>First to the basics. As the<a id="_idIndexMarker1206"/> built-in volume controls can only increase volume by <strong class="bold">+12 dB</strong>, you'll need an effect to make a clip louder than that. The <strong class="bold">Gain</strong> filter can add another <strong class="bold">+24 dB</strong> (as well as phase inversion and stereo swapping), but it's not the only effect that includes a gain feature. The <strong class="bold">Fat EQ</strong>, <strong class="bold">Linear Phase EQ</strong>, <strong class="bold">Limiter</strong>, and <strong class="bold">AUDynamicsProcessor</strong> can do the same job, so consider them instead:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer707" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_14.55_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.55: Gain is very simple, but you can get the same controls<span> elsewhere</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Next, the more advanced options, including the various limiters and compressors, are geared toward reducing the dynamic range between the quietest and loudest parts of a recording. <strong class="bold">Limiter</strong> and <strong class="bold">Adaptive Limiter</strong> are simple enough to understand: push up the input by some amount on the <strong class="bold">Gain</strong> dial, then turn down <strong class="bold">Output</strong> to the maximum level you want to hear, and the <a id="_idIndexMarker1207"/>gaps between the quietest and loudest sounds are reduced, so everything comes out more even:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer708" class="figure">&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.56: Push everything up, and then push the loudest parts <span>down again</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Logic's <strong class="bold">Compressor</strong> is more subtle, using <strong class="bold">Threshold</strong> and <strong class="bold">Ratio</strong> controls to govern the volume changes, and with a built-in <strong class="bold">Limiter</strong> at the end of the chain. This is a powerful effect that takes time to understand (read the built-in help!) and you'll need to tune the settings to suit:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer709" class="figure">&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.57: Sounds above the Threshold ar<span>e reduced </span>&#13;

			<p><strong class="bold">AUDynamicsProcessor</strong> is a lower-level tool with a graphical curves-based interface that shows you when audio is being <a id="_idIndexMarker1208"/>shaped, and over which volume levels that shaping occurs:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.58: Sounds reaching into the red are reduced as the graph indicates, and Master Gain is applied <span>at the end</span></p>&#13;
			<p><strong class="bold">Expander</strong> is the opposite of a <strong class="bold">Compressor</strong>, expanding the dynamic range to make your clip sound more lively.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">Understanding the order of operations is important, and these levels-based controls are often applied as the final step in processing. Remember as you experiment here that you may wish to apply effects not just to individual clips, but to entire Roles at a single stroke.</p>&#13;
			<p>Another effect to know about is <strong class="bold">Noise Gate</strong>, which silences quiet sounds below a certain threshold. This can be used as a simple form of noise reduction, but be careful that it doesn't sound too noticeable:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

			<p>Levels controls are valuable, and <a id="_idIndexMarker1209"/>we'll return to them in just a moment when we look at the <strong class="bold">Voice</strong> controls.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-414"><a id="_idTextAnchor431"/>Modulation</h3>&#13;
			<p>These can best be <a id="_idIndexMarker1210"/>described as <em class="italic">fun distortion</em>. <strong class="bold">Phaser</strong>, <strong class="bold">Phlanger</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Scanner Vibrato</strong> live here:</p>&#13;

			<h3 id="_idParaDest-415"><a id="_idTextAnchor432"/>Spaces</h3>&#13;
			<p>This collection of<a id="_idIndexMarker1211"/> reverberation and echo effects can make a recording sound like it was taken in a much larger room, even in a specific, <a id="_idTextAnchor433"/>real-world hall or cathedral:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.61: Space Designer has a ridiculous number o<span>f presets </span>&#13;

			<p>This is useful when trying to <a id="_idIndexMarker1212"/>make a clip sound more like it was recorded in an entirely different space. For example, you might record replacement audio in a studio, but need that clip to sound as if it's in a large hall.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-416"><a id="_idTextAnchor434"/>Specialized</h3>&#13;
			<p>This group of effects can be<a id="_idIndexMarker1213"/> safely ignored unless you know you need them:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

			<h3 id="_idParaDest-417"><a id="_idTextAnchor435"/>Voice</h3>&#13;
			<p>While most of these effects <a id="_idIndexMarker1215"/>are for pitch-shifting or vocal silliness (Monster, Robot, Helium, Disguised), there's one standout worth further attention. <strong class="bold">Voice Over Enhancement</strong> provides an all-in-one fix for voice, combining a <strong class="bold">Compressor</strong> to equalize volume levels, a <strong class="bold">DeEsser</strong> to reduce sibilance, and a <strong class="bold">Channel EQ</strong> to enhance specific vocal frequencies:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.63: Tempting as an all-in-one starting point, but twe<span>ak to suit</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The presets here provide different Channel EQ settings to enhance male and female voices for smooth or punchy results. This effect can be a great starting point for further tweaking to suit particular voices, and if you work with a voiceover artist regularly, consider saving a preset specifically for their voice. </p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-418"><a id="_idTextAnchor436"/>Third-party effects</h3>&#13;
			<p>Below all the built-in effects, you'll <a id="_idIndexMarker1216"/>find any other effects that you've purchased from third parties. Not every audio effect designed for Logic Pro will work in Final Cut Pro X, so check for compatibility (or test out a trial) before purchasing. Though there are many third-party effects available, if you only buy one, make it a good noise <a id="_idIndexMarker1217"/>reduction plugin. (I can recommend the iZotope RX Elements plug-in pack and its Voice Denoise.)</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-419"><a id="_idTextAnchor437"/>Review — Applying and using audio effects</h2>&#13;
			<p>Now you know: audio<a id="_idIndexMarker1218"/> effects are a lot like video effects. Many effects are original, while<a id="_idIndexMarker1219"/> others function like Effects Presets, and while it's easy to find something silly, the most useful effects are the most subtle ones. You know how to apply effects and make presets, so explore and get comfortable with your options. The categories have a fair bit of crossover, but you'll quickly find your favorites and learn how to tweak the settings to your liking.</p>&#13;
			<p>If you work with voice, like many videographers do, focus your efforts there. Voice Over Enhancement is an effect that could well see a lot of use, and once you grow more confident, you'll be messing with EQ, compressors, and limiters to make the fussiest clients happy. But wait! Before you apply effects to every individual clip, consider an alternative workflow. Read on to find out how to use <strong class="bold">Roles</strong> for audio processing.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-420"><a id="_idTextAnchor438"/>Using Roles with audio</h1>&#13;
			<p>Roles<a id="_idIndexMarker1220"/> make audio processing simpler by allowing adjustments<a id="_idIndexMarker1221"/> and effects to be applied to an entire class of audio, such as Dialogue or Music. In addition, Roles can make it easy to hand over isolated audio stems to another application for more specialized processing, and all without tracks. In this section, you'll learn about how the audio signal flow works, and how to use Compound Clips to control audio at the Role level. By the end, you'll know how to maintain the Roles you defined for your media (way back at import time) all the way through the production process.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-421"><a id="_idTextAnchor439"/>Understanding signal flow</h2>&#13;
			<p>The path that an audio clip <a id="_idIndexMarker1222"/>follows from camera to export doesn't have to be complex, but you'll need to know what's happening to avoid a few issues. Applying an effect at the wrong point in the chain, or to a certain kind of container clip, can cause Audio Roles to be combined, and potentially cause some confusion.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">This topic can be complicated, and since many readers won't need to worry about the finer details, I'll keep it brief here. For all the fine print, search for an online White Paper from Apple called <em class="italic">Audio Roles in Final Cut Pro X</em> [currently available at <a href="https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/docs/Audio_Roles.pdf">https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/docs/Audio_Roles.pdf</a>].</p>&#13;
			<p>Each clip in a timeline can have multiple components, and while usually they would have the same Role (often <strong class="bold">Dialogue</strong>), that's not always the case. More complex clips, such as a Compound Clip, may combine <a id="_idIndexMarker1223"/>different <strong class="bold">Audio Roles</strong>, such as <strong class="bold">Music</strong>, <strong class="bold">Effects</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Dialogue</strong>. It's also possible that a single clip might contain audio from multiple microphones that are assigned to separate Subroles:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer716" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_14.64_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.64: Dialogue and Music are present in this longer Com<span>pound Clip</span></p>&#13;
			<p>In each of these cases, the separate Roles or Subroles are safely separated when viewing the timeline with <strong class="bold">Audio Lanes</strong>, and can also be exported independently. However, applying an effect to a clip that shares Roles or Subroles will cause the distinctions between these Roles to be lost, because the separate audio components are mixed together before any effects are applied. Instead, such clips are given a new <em class="italic">Mixed Audio</em> Role, which is less than ideal.</p>&#13;
			<p>One solution is simply not to apply any effects at all, and let a dedicated audio specialist handle the job. That's certainly an option, but you don't have to go that far. Instead, if a clip has mixed Roles, apply effects to <em class="italic">audio components</em> rather than to entire clips. How is this done?</p>&#13;
			<p>At the bottom of the <strong class="bold">Audio</strong> tab in the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong>, you'll find the audio components section. In a simple clip, this will probably show as <strong class="bold">Mono</strong> or <strong class="bold">Stereo</strong> with a single component underneath, but if you've chosen <strong class="bold">Dual Mono</strong>, there will be two channels underneath, and in a Multicam clip, you'll see a channel for each angle's audio. Each can be selected independently, and when a single audio component is selected, any effects you add will be applied to just that component:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer717" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_14.65_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.65: Choosing Dual Mono shows two individual channels <span>underneath</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The following points <a id="_idIndexMarker1224"/>are important:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>If the first item underneath <strong class="bold">Audio Configuration</strong> is selected (as it is by default), then an effect listed above applies to the w<span>hole clip.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>If a component or channel is selected, effects shown above will only apply to that component. Those effects can only be seen when that component is selected, so be careful — effectively, <em class="italic">you can apply an effect to only one component of a clip</em>, and you won't be able to see that when selecting the w<span>hole clip.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>The situation is a little different for Compound Clips. Instead of channels, the audio components section shows the Roles contained inside this clip. A drop-down menu to the right lets you choose whether you want to show <strong class="bold">Roles</strong> or <strong class="bold">Subroles</strong> as components below, and choosing Roles effectively mixes any Subroles together. You would choose Subroles if, for example, you had applied different Subroles to different character's microphones, and wanted to apply different effects to each one:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer718" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_14.66_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.66: This Compound Clip has dialog from camera and a voi<span>ceover too</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Multicam Clips will<a id="_idIndexMarker1225"/> output their Role components based on the angle currently chosen. Due to the nature of Multicam Clips, those angles are likely to share the same parent Role, though each angle could use different Subroles.</p>&#13;
			<p>Synchronized Clips will show separate Role components for their Storyline (the original camera audio, usually disabled) and the secondary audio (a separate track, usually enabled).</p>&#13;
			<p>The outcome of all this? If Roles are important in your output, don't apply effects to clips with more than one Role, and if Subroles are important, don't apply effects to clips to multiple Subroles. Instead, do one of the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Select a Role or Subrole at the clip level, and apply effects to a single <span>component.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Double-click a Compound Clip to open it, and apply effects to individual clips inside the Comp<span>ound Clip.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>These strategies are especially important when used with the <strong class="bold">Timeline Index</strong> to mix an entire timeline at once.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-422"><a id="_idTextAnchor440"/>Using Compound Clips for audio mixing</h2>&#13;
			<p>If applying<a id="_idIndexMarker1226"/> effects to hundreds of individual clips <a id="_idIndexMarker1227"/>seems daunting — don't. Instead, it's possible to apply effects to entire Roles at once, by turning your entire Project into a Compound Clip, and then viewing individual Roles or Subroles using the <strong class="bold">Timeline Index</strong>. It's going to be useful when exporting (in <a href="B15343_16_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor491"><em class="italic">Chapter 16</em></a>, <em class="italic">You're Done: Exporting Your Edit and Finishing Up</em>), but it's also useful for the audio mixing stage right now.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">Before we continue, it's worth remembering that you don't necessarily have to follow these steps in this order, or even at all. Fairly simple jobs might use just a few audio clips, easy enough to deal with separately. On other jobs, you might be provided with fully processed audio that needs no work at all. And of course, you can tackle the audio processing in multiple stages in whatever order you wish. You might apply some effects to a few problematic clips, finish the visual side of the edit by adding titles, and then return for the final audio mix. Alternatively, you might do the final audio mix first in a Compound Clip, and then dip inside that Compound Clip to add the titles. Either approach is fine; don't feel constrained to strictly follow the order of every chapter in this book.</p>&#13;
			<p>The first step before <a id="_idIndexMarker1228"/>beginning an overall audio mix is to duplicate <a id="_idIndexMarker1229"/>your Project, in case something goes badly wrong. For this exercise, you'll need a near-complete Project with several different Audio Roles, and Subroles if you'll be using them too. So, grab that TV pilot you've been working on (or a test Project with multiple Audio Roles) and follow these steps to get started:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">In <strong class="bold">Browser</strong>, click to select your Project, and then press <strong class="bold">⌘D</strong> to duplicate th<span>e Project.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Rename the new duplicate to add "audio mix" to<span> the name.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Double-click the new duplicate Project t<span>o edit it.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Click in the <strong class="bold">Timeline</strong> pane, and then press <strong class="bold">⌘A</strong> to select all <span>its clips:</span><div id="_idContainer719" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_14.67_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.67: In a complex timeline, this might take a f<span>ew seconds</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">⌥G</strong> to convert the <a id="_idIndexMarker1230"/>entire timeline to a new Compound Clip, and name it in the sheet <a id="_idIndexMarker1231"/>tha<span>t appears:</span><div id="_idContainer720" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_14.68_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.68: All combined into a single Com<span>pound Clip</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>If it's not already visible, show the <strong class="bold">Timeline Index</strong> by clicking <strong class="bold">Index</strong> at the left of the central gray bar or by pre<span>ssing </span><span><strong class="bold">⇧⌘2</strong></span><span>.</span><p>You'll remember the Timeline Index from <a href="B15343_10_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor271"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">Explore a Little: Compound Clips and Timeline tricks</em>.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>If it's not already selected, click <strong class="bold">Roles</strong> at the top of <span>this pane.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Click <strong class="bold">Show Audio Lanes</strong> at the bottom of <span>this pane.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Clip Appearance</strong> menu to the right of the central gray bar, check <strong class="bold">Clip Roles</strong> and then uncheck <strong class="bold">C</strong><span><strong class="bold">lip Names</strong></span><span>:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer721" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_14.69_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.69: Showing Clip Roles instead of Clip Names to keep thi<span>ngs simple</span></p>&#13;
			<p>At this point, each<a id="_idIndexMarker1232"/> Role within the Compound Clip is shown as a<a id="_idIndexMarker1233"/> clip-length item in its own lane, with a small icon indicating that a mixdown has occurred:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer722" class="figure">&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.70: The audio in each Role can have effects applied or volume adjusted (this ne<span>eds work!)</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Each component can be adjusted just as easily as if it were a single clip, including volume adjustments, audio enhancements, panning, and effects. Selecting a component in the timeline selects the appropriate Role component in the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong>, and everything works just as it does on individual clips.</p>&#13;
			<p>If you've tagged your clips with appropriate Roles and Subroles, you can use this technique to do the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Apply the same Voice Over Enhancement effect to every<span> voiceover</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Apply different Voice Over Enhancement effects to male and female <span>voiceovers</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Apply different audio effects to each characte<span>r speaking</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Apply different compression or EQ effects to music, effects, <span>and dialog</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Apply different volumes to music, effects, <span>and dialog</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Apply different surround panning treatments to music, effects, <span>and dialog</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Duck (reduce) the volume of all music and effects elements while a person i<span>s speaking</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>While overall<a id="_idIndexMarker1234"/> adjustments are useful and powerful, you can still<a id="_idIndexMarker1235"/> adjust the clips inside the Compound Clip, so don't be afraid to double-click your way inside. If a particular clip needs special treatment, go ahead and add that effect or change those levels. A Compound Clip doesn't need to be a locked-off silo, but usually the overall audio mix is a step you'd perform last, or near the end of the process.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-423"><a id="_idTextAnchor441"/>Review — Using Roles with audio</h2>&#13;
			<p>Roles<a id="_idIndexMarker1236"/> are a <a id="_idIndexMarker1237"/>unique feature for Final Cut Pro X, and one which saves a lot of time. And even if you don't use Compound Clips to perform Role-level adjustments or add effects, you might want to use them to control how your work is exported — stay tuned to the final chapter for more on that. And finally, even if you're just exporting a simple video yourself, and don't need Roles for their mastering or export controls, you can use them simply to add color to your timeline. It's nice to be able to see what a clip does at a quick glance, and Roles do that too. Let's wrap this up.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-424"><a id="_idTextAnchor442"/>Summary</h1>&#13;
			<p>Audio is a critically important part of a video. Even though it's often treated as less important by an editor who's more aligned with the video side of things, bad audio will ruin a good video every time. The standard approach, to buy good equipment and use it properly, will work most of the time, but however careful you are, you'll need to be able to turn down that uncontrollable air conditioner or bird, level out that person who spoke at an inconsistent volume, and find a way to deal with the microphone that's rubbing on that jacket or suffering electronic interference.</p>&#13;
			<p>Now that you know how to add a voiceover, control its volume, add effects, and manage Roles, those tasks are much easier. Because you also understand how Roles can be applied, more complex tasks should be easier too. With the audio taken care of, at least for now, it's time to look at the world of titling and captioning.</p>&#13;
