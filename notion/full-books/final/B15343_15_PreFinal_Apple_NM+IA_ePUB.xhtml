			<p class="author-quote">"FCP X not only changed the lives of editors who use it in post production, it also changed that way those editors interact with directors/story-producers like me. I use it e<span>very day."</span></p>&#13;
			<p class="author-quote-source">— Cirina Catania: filmmaker, host of OWC RADiO, a partner in Lumberjack System and most known for co-founding the Sundance Film Festival <a href="http://cirinacatania.com">cirinacatania.com</a> </p>&#13;
			<p>Words are an important part of many videos, especially today. As more of us consume more video online, we're doing so in more places, often without audio, and augmenting the audio with words is a great way to compensate. Titles can be purely informational or can bring extra emphasis to important points, while captions allow anyone who can't hear your audio to understand what's being said. Generators fill in the gaps that your videos and photos can't, and give your work some extra flair.</p>&#13;
			<p>In this chapter, you'll learn all about the process of choosing, adding, and manipulating titles, including an extra look at the most flexible general-purpose option, the <strong class="bold">Custom</strong> title. Generators are important too; they can provide not only backgrounds for titles but also ways for an editor to build complex composites, with built-in and third-party options available. You'll also learn about captioning, which is important for accessibility, searchability, and more.</p>&#13;
			<p>In bullet-point form, you'll discover more about the following topics:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Adding and edit<span>ing titles</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Advanced title <span>techniques</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Adding and editing <span>Generators</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Captioning and<span> subtitles</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Titling is a key task, and the strong integration between Motion and Final Cut Pro X (FCP X) makes amazing titles easy. In other non-linear editing systems (NLEs), it's common to outsource production of titles to a separate motion graphics artist, or use extremely simple static titles that simply fade in and out. Here, you can do it all yourself, and you can go as crazy as the job allows, or create something with elegant, subtle movement that can enhance the most restrained timeline.</p>&#13;
			<p>Usually, titles are used to add words, but you can enter emojis to include color symbols as well. It's also possible to use dingbat fonts such as Zapf Dingbats, Google's Material Icons, or FontAwesome to add custom symbols, arrows, and other shapes. If you're happy with <a id="_idTextAnchor447"/>single-color titles, these fonts (unlike emoji fonts) also work in 3D and are an excellent idea if you want to label a shot without words, or just point at something. An example can be seen in the following screenshot:</p>&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.1: Yes – this 3D arrow <span>is a title</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The titling workflow in FCP X is really excellent: fast, flexible, and powerful. If you want to go beyond what the built-in templates allow, you can build your own or modify any existing templates, with Apple's companion product Motion. But it all begins with a basic title, so let's get started there.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-428"><a id="_idTextAnchor448"/>Adding and editing titles</h1>&#13;
			<p>In this section, you'll<a id="_idIndexMarker1238"/> find out how to add one of the many built-in title<a id="_idIndexMarker1239"/> templates to add a full-screen title, a lower third, or anything else you wish. You'll find out how to edit text parameters on every title, learn how to change any parameters that a particular title template has exposed for editing, and understand <strong class="bold">Find and Replace T</strong><strong class="bold">itle Text</strong>.</p>&#13;
			<p>The very first titles we'll add are static, simple, and boring, but don't worry — we'll animate them soon enough! </p>&#13;
			<p>To start, you'll need a timeline with some clips in it, and ideally, you'll also include a shot of a person who needs an onscreen title:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer725" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_15.2_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.2: A timeline with a person needing a lower third title in the clip to the<span> top right</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Any resolution<a id="_idIndexMarker1240"/> and frame rate will do, and when you've got it ready, follow these<a id="_idIndexMarker1241"/> steps:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Click on the <strong class="bold">Titles and Generator</strong> icon at the top of the <strong class="bold">Browser</strong>, as shown her<span>e in blue:</span><div id="_idContainer726" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_15.3_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.3: The third icon along is the one you're l<span>ooking for</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Browser</strong>, click the small disclosure triangle next to the word <strong class="bold">Titles</strong>, to expose the categori<span>es within.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Bumper/Opener</strong><span> category.</span><p>All these titles can be previewed by hovering over them, though obviously you'll only see their default state this way:</p><div id="_idContainer727" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_15.4_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.4: The Titles browser, with many third-party titles and some Motion-based experimen<span>tation too</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Drag the <strong class="bold">Basic Title</strong> to <a id="_idIndexMarker1242"/>a<a id="_idIndexMarker1243"/> spot in the Primary <span>Storyline.</span><p>Though each title defines its own standard duration, you can change its length by trimming, as you would with any other clip. Skimming over this particular title in the timeline will simply show the word <strong class="bold">Title</strong> in a default font, but each title is different. It'll look like this:</p><div id="_idContainer728" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_15.5_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.5: A title placed on the primary storyline takes up a full c<span>lip height</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Viewer</strong>, double-click on the word <strong class="bold">Title</strong> to edit it, then overtype with your <span>own title.</span><p>There's plenty of flexibility in how the text appears, and we'll look at that soon.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Lower Thirds</strong> title category, and drag <strong class="bold">Basic Lower Third</strong> to connect<a id="_idIndexMarker1244"/> above <a id="_idIndexMarker1245"/>ano<span>ther clip.</span><p>This time, the title includes two text elements and takes up much less height in the timeline, displaying no thumbnail filmstrip:</p></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer729" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_15.6_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.6: A connected title is more compact than a re<span>gular clip</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The default positions and sizes are appropriate for giving a name and position to a person on the screen, so it's ideal for use as a connected title. Each of the two elements can be edited and repositioned independently, using these controls:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Double-click a text element in the <strong class="bold">Viewer</strong> to <span>select it.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Overtype the selected text t<span>o edit it.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Drag the text element's crosshair to repo<span>sition it.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">Escape</strong> to stop editing a tex<span>t element.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Use the <strong class="bold">Text Layer</strong> arrows at the very bottom of the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> to switch to other text<a id="_idIndexMarker1246"/> elements within the same title. Multiple text elements will<a id="_idIndexMarker1247"/> appear <span>like this:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer730" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_15.7_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.7: Double-click on a text element to edit it; Esca<span>pe to stop</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Most of the time, you'll need to reposition the text with regard to the content of the frame, the size of the text, and overall composition, but there are subtleties, as you'll discover next.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-429"><a id="_idTextAnchor449"/>Positioning text elements</h2>&#13;
			<p>While most text <a id="_idIndexMarker1248"/>elements in the built-in titles feature a crosshair, some text elements are designed to accept an entire paragraph of text, with resize handles at the corners and sides. These boxes will automatically wrap text at their edges and are more convenient for larger amounts of text. Line breaks can be added manually to either type of text, though.</p>&#13;
			<p>When you move text elements around the Viewer, consider how the video will be viewed. Text at the bottom of the screen is often obscured by a playback bar, at least for the first few seconds of playback, so avoid that zone early on. It's also a good idea to choose <strong class="bold">Show</strong> <strong class="bold">Title/Action Safe Zones</strong> from the Viewer's <strong class="bold">View</strong> drop-down menu:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer731" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_15.8_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.8: Use the Title/Action Safe Zones when positioning your tex<span>t elements</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Two yellow boxes will <a id="_idIndexMarker1249"/>appear on the screen: the <strong class="bold">Action Safe</strong> (90%) box outside, and the <strong class="bold">Title Safe</strong> (80%) box inside, indicating where the edges of the screen might be cropped off entirely or distorted on an older TV set.</p>&#13;
			<p>It's now possible (<em class="italic">new in 10.4.9</em>) to use a <strong class="bold">Custom Overlay</strong> in a similar way to the safe zones. This overlay file can be any image, though using a mostly transparent PNG file that matches your project's aspect ratio and resolution is recommended. Your image could include custom safe zone areas, a reference example of previous text or image positioning, a screenshot to remind you where playback controls are often shown, or simply a grid. The process is straightforward:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Create or download you<span>r graphic.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>From the Viewer's <strong class="bold">View</strong> menu, select <strong class="bold">Choose Custom Overlay</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Add Custo</strong><span><strong class="bold">m Overlay</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Locate you<span>r graphic.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Change the opacity of the overlay (to 25%/50%/75%/100%) with the submenu underneath <strong class="bold">View</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Show Custo</strong><span><strong class="bold">m Overlay</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Hide or show the overlay by selecting the <strong class="bold">Show Custom Overlay</strong> option directly, rather than an opacity in th<span>e submenu:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer732" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_15.9_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.9: This custom grid includes safe zones, extra <span>markings, </span>&#13;
and a reminder that the bottom part of the screen is ofte<span>n obscured</span></p>&#13;
			<p>A custom overlay can <a id="_idIndexMarker1250"/>help you to make sure that you position your text in exactly the same spot every time, and when used with the safe areas, can help you make sure that your text is always seen.</p>&#13;
			<p>While images are cropped less often on modern devices than on CRT televisions, the edges of a video can still be cropped off in some circumstances, so avoid putting text at the very edges of the screen. Some modern TV guidelines call for text to sit within the 90% outer boundary, so if you position the text within the outer Action Safe box, you should be safe on most devices. However, a wide phone set to fill its screen might crop into that zone on the top and bottom, so consider using the height of the original Title Safe box for critical elements. Also, remember that the text will be unreadable if it's too small.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-430"><a id="_idTextAnchor450"/>Editing basic text properties</h2>&#13;
			<p>You're not stuck<a id="_idIndexMarker1251"/> with the default font or size, but you'll need<a id="_idIndexMarker1252"/> the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> to edit most text properties. As you might expect, <strong class="bold">⌥-clicking</strong> on a title is a good way to make sure that you're working (in the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong>) on the same thing you're looking at (in the <strong class="bold">Viewer</strong>). With titles, there's another option, because <em class="italic">double-clicking on a title</em> selects the title and moves the Playhead to its center.</p>&#13;
			<p>There are two tabs in the Inspector that are important to understand when working with titles. The <em class="italic">first icon</em> (a <strong class="bold">T</strong> in a box) is the <strong class="bold">Title Inspector</strong>, and it's different for every title. We'll come back to that soon, but here, the second icon is highlighted in blue:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer733" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_15.10_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.10: The Text Inspector (second icon along) is sel<span>ected here</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The <em class="italic">second icon</em> (a few lines of text) is the <strong class="bold">Text Inspector</strong>, and it offers the same controls for every text element in every title. No matter which title you're using, the <strong class="bold">Text</strong> controls will be reliable and predictable, selected automatically after you double-click on a text element. Importantly, if pasted text includes styles (font, size, and color information) then those styles will be <em class="italic">maintained if you paste into the Viewer, but discarded if you paste into the Inspector</em>. Because I usually want to style the text myself, I nearly always select the text in the Inspector before pasting.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">Choosing a good font is important, doubly so because many editors never do. Many years ago, in the <em class="italic">Classic Final Cut Pro</em> days, I remember watching a famous awards presentation in which 9 of the 10 nominees for best short and long documentary had used the same default font (<strong class="bold">Lucida Grande</strong>) for their titles. I've since seen people in the real world using titles that I've designed, using (you guessed it!) the default font that I chose in the first place. Whichever font you end up with, make sure it's not the default, because your work will look like everyone else's if you do.</p>&#13;
			<p>To start editing the text properties, find the <strong class="bold">Basic Lower Third</strong> title you've already added, and then follow these steps:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Double-click the title to select it and move the Playhead to t<span>hat point.</span><p>Double-clicking also selects all the text within the first <strong class="bold">Name</strong> element in this title. If you want to replace the text with new words that's fine, but be sure to reselect the text with <strong class="bold">⌘A</strong> if you do so.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong>, experiment <a id="_idIndexMarker1253"/>with the settings<a id="_idIndexMarker1254"/> in the <strong class="bold">Basic</strong> section, including <strong class="bold">Font</strong> and <strong class="bold">Size</strong>, <strong class="bold">Alignment</strong>, <strong class="bold">Line Spacing</strong> (leading), and<span> </span><span><strong class="bold">Tracking</strong></span><span>.</span><p>A client will often provide a style guide to define how their titles should appear. Here, we'll use the principles of <strong class="bold">Contrast</strong>, <strong class="bold">Repetition</strong>, <strong class="bold">Alignment</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Proximity</strong> from <em class="italic">The Non-Designer's Design Book</em> by Robin Williams.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Set <strong class="bold">Font</strong> to <strong class="bold">Avenir Next Bold</strong> and <strong class="bold">S</strong><span><strong class="bold">ize</strong></span><span> to </span><span><strong class="source-inline">70</strong></span><span>.</span><p>This is big and bold, but not so big that longer names would be hard to accommodate.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Double-click on the smaller <strong class="bold">Description</strong> text element, and then set <strong class="bold">Font</strong> to <strong class="bold">Avenir Next Regular</strong>, <strong class="bold">Size</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">40</strong>, <strong class="bold">All Caps</strong> on, and <strong class="bold">All Caps Size</strong><span> to </span><span><strong class="source-inline">100.0</strong></span><span>:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer734" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_15.11_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.11: Contrast between the two lines of text draws the eye to the most important informa<span>tion first</span></p>&#13;
			<p>This is a good combination with the bolder name style, allowing <strong class="bold">Contrast</strong> to draw the eye to the name first, and their title second. With the two styles working well together, we can reuse these<a id="_idIndexMarker1255"/> easily in future titles. This <strong class="bold">Repetition</strong> principle <a id="_idIndexMarker1256"/>ensures consistency and makes your job easier. To save these text settings for future use:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Double-click again on the larger <strong class="bold">Name</strong> text element t<span>o edit it.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>At the top of the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong>, where <strong class="bold">Normal</strong> is currently shown, choose <strong class="bold">Save</strong> <strong class="bold">Format Attributes</strong> from the drop-<span>down menu.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>In the dialog that appears, name the style as <strong class="bold">Big Av</strong><span><strong class="bold">enir Bold</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Double-click on the smaller <strong class="bold">Description</strong> text element t<span>o edit it.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>At the top of the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong>, choose <strong class="bold">Save Format Attributes</strong><span> from the </span>&#13;
drop-down menu, and name the style as <strong class="bold">Smaller Aveni</strong><span><strong class="bold">r Regular</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>These styles can be used again any time you want them. While it's pretty easy to duplicate titles with a quick <strong class="bold">⌥-drag</strong>, saving styles makes it easier to apply the same look to other kinds of titles. Here are a few I prepared earlier:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer735" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_15.12_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.12: Saving text styles lets you reuse common settings across multiple jobs – <span>Repetition</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Now, it's time to<a id="_idIndexMarker1257"/> reposition the two elements a little closer<a id="_idIndexMarker1258"/> to the edges of the screen. You'll want to keep them lined up with one another (<strong class="bold">Alignment</strong>) and make sure they're still close to one another and not too close to the edges of the screen (<strong class="bold">Proximity</strong>). Here, I'll position the text in the upper third of the screen rather than the lower third, though either can work. Here's how to do it:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Drag the upper <strong class="bold">Name</strong> text element to just inside the left edge of the outer <strong class="bold">Action Safe</strong> line, and position the top edge to the edge of the inner <strong class="bold">Title </strong><span><strong class="bold">Safe</strong></span><span> line.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Drag the larger <strong class="bold">Description</strong> text element to just below the <strong class="bold">Name</strong> element, aligned v<span>ertically:</span><div id="_idContainer736" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_15.13_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.13: Alignment and Proximity are both importan<span>t settings</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Turn off the <strong class="bold">Action/Title Safe Zones</strong> setting with the <strong class="bold">View</strong> menu in t<span>he </span><span><strong class="bold">Viewer</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>You'll be able to see the <a id="_idIndexMarker1259"/>overall composition much more clearly<a id="_idIndexMarker1260"/> without the safe zones, so reposition the text elements if you need to. If you're using closed captions (and you should be!), remember that captions might obscure the titles. Consider using a higher "upper third" text placement if you expect your video to be shown on small screens, and especially if it's an advertisement.</p>&#13;
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Basic</strong> text properties can be seen in the following screenshot:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer737" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_15.14_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.14: Use the numbers in the Positio<span>n section </span>&#13;

			<p>While you can always<a id="_idIndexMarker1261"/> position text with a drag in <a id="_idIndexMarker1262"/>the <strong class="bold">Viewer</strong>, the <strong class="bold">Position</strong>, <strong class="bold">Rotation</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Scale</strong> properties in the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> (just below the other options) allow you to be as precise as you want to be. And there's more to come.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-431"><a id="_idTextAnchor451"/>Editing other text properties</h3>&#13;
			<p>Underneath<a id="_idIndexMarker1263"/> the <strong class="bold">Basic</strong> text properties, you'll find five more categories<a id="_idIndexMarker1264"/> full of properties: <strong class="bold">3D Text</strong>, <strong class="bold">Face</strong>, <strong class="bold">Outline</strong>, <strong class="bold">Glow</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Drop Shadow</strong>. Each of these categories is hidden by default, so hover over the name to see the word <strong class="bold">Show</strong> appear, and then click on the word itself. Here's a quick explanation of what these options cover:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">3D Text</strong> — A huge amount of power with some subtle tricks hiding there, and we'll return to this one in the next section. Let's leave it off for no<span>w, though.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Face</strong> — Important controls over the color or gradient that fills the text, along with blur and opacity<span> controls.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Outline</strong> — An outline can be added to the text, with a variable width, color,<span> and blur.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Glow</strong> — An even blurrier outline that can be pushed well beyond<span> the text.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Drop Shadow</strong> — A dark shadow behind the text that has come in and out of fashion over the past few years, and is due for a resurgence. A subtle shadow can be important when separating white text from a lighter background (remember <strong class="bold">Contrast</strong>), but don't o<span>verdo it. </span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>These text <a id="_idIndexMarker1265"/>appearance o<a id="_idIndexMarker1266"/>ptions can be seen here:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.15: Text appearance options, activ<span>e and set </span>&#13;
to their defaults – remember to ch<span>ange them!</span></p>&#13;
			<p><strong class="bold">Face</strong> is obviously critical to control the color of text, and while you might not need to use all the other controls for every title, it's great that the options are there. An important use for these controls is to animate them so that the text can, for example, appear transparent and blurry at first, but then come into focus. Luckily, there are title templates that can do that for you, and you may not need to play directly with these settings very often.</p>&#13;
			<p>The 2D Styles<a id="_idIndexMarker1267"/> presets <a id="_idIndexMarker1268"/>can be seen here: </p>&#13;

			<p>To see a few of these extended properties in action, check out a few of the presets at the top of the Inspector, just underneath the tabs. From the menu there, choose <strong class="bold">2D Sty</strong><strong class="bold">les</strong>, then:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Block</strong> — to see how the glow can be used to create a blocky, pseudo<span>-3D effect</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Retro Neue</strong> — to add a gradient and crazy colors to that <span>same look:</span></li>&#13;

				<li><strong class="bold">Neon</strong> — to see gradients, outlines, and shadows all used at once with a ro<span>unded font</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Outline</strong> — to see that you don't always have to <span>use a fill</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Paper</strong> — to see one of the built-in textures used as a fill (normally, you'd use a <strong class="bold">Blend Mode</strong> for th<span>is effect)</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>There are many more, and you can of course make your own. When you get the settings right and want to save a new preset text style, use <strong class="bold">Save All Format and Appearance Attributes</strong> from the drop-down menu to preserve the extended settings (collectively, <strong class="bold">Appearance</strong>), as well<a id="_idIndexMarker1269"/> as the font settings (<strong class="bold">Format</strong>).</p>&#13;
			<p>But what's<a id="_idIndexMarker1270"/> that <strong class="bold">3D</strong> option in the presets? Let's take a look.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-432"><a id="_idTextAnchor452"/>Editing 3D text parameters</h3>&#13;
			<p>If you check <a id="_idIndexMarker1271"/>the <strong class="bold">3D Text</strong> option in the text properties for any<a id="_idIndexMarker1272"/> title, the <strong class="bold">Face</strong> and <strong class="bold">Outline</strong> sections disappear, replaced by:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">3D Text</strong> — Depth, weight, and bevel controls to change how thick the letters are in all three d<span>imensions.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Lighting</strong> — To redirect the light source and its <span>intensity.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Material</strong> — Offering a huge variety of fabrics, woods, stones, and metals, among others. Pick from the <strong class="bold">Appearance</strong> drop-down list, then (depending on your choice) finesse the <strong class="bold">Options</strong>, <strong class="bold">Finish</strong>, <strong class="bold">Paint</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Substance</strong><span> settings.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Here's an example of the Redwood preset:</p>&#13;

			<p>Probably the most important control is to be found in the Viewer, where the old position control has made way for a 3D position and rotation widget. Clicking once on a 3D text element displays three arrows, for movement, and three circles, for rotation. Each arrow is shown in a color (red, green, and blue) that corresponds to movement in the <em class="italic">x</em>, <em class="italic">y</em>, and <em class="italic">z</em> axis respectively. Understanding the arrows and circles is important for careful movement, so let's take a look by doing the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Click and drag on any arrow to move the 3D text along that axis — red = <em class="italic">x</em>, green = <em class="italic">y</em>, and<a id="_idIndexMarker1275"/> blue = <em class="italic">z</em>. The arrows can be seen <a id="_idIndexMarker1276"/>in the following s<span>creenshot:</span></li>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.20: The R/G/B arrows allow for movement in the <span>x/y/z axes</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Each circle is white, but shows red, green, or blue when you hover over it. Which is which?</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Click and drag the top (red) circle to rotate around <em class="italic">x</em> (tilt,<span> or pitch)</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Click and drag the left (green) circle to rotate around <em class="italic">y</em> (pa<span>n, or yaw)</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Click and drag the right (blue) circle to rotate aroun<span>d </span><span><em class="italic">z</em></span><span> (roll)</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>The green circle is being dragged in the following screenshot:</p>&#13;

			<p>It's quite powerful to be able to place editable 3D text on your timeline without thinking about it, and the only issue is that a 3D title could be overkill when used in the wrong situations. Use with restraint.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">If you're looking for 3D controls, but you've already double-clicked and the text is selected for editing, you've gone too far. Press <strong class="bold">Escape</strong> and click just once on the text element to see its 3D controls. If you ever get stuck editing text and you can't access the controls you're looking for, click elsewhere in the timeline to select nothing, then <strong class="bold">⌥-click</strong> once on the title and start over.</p>&#13;
			<p>As well as the <a id="_idIndexMarker1277"/>universal 2D and 3D text controls, each title allows <a id="_idIndexMarker1278"/>access to unique properties that can completely change how they look and how they animate on or off the screen. Understanding how these controls work is crucial, and that's next.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-433">Editing unique parameters and <a id="_idTextAnchor453"/>adding animation</h2>&#13;
			<p>Some<a id="_idIndexMarker1279"/> animated titles have quite a distinctive look, and<a id="_idIndexMarker1280"/> while this can be effective, if you use a title style that viewers have seen many times before, it'll feel stale. It's therefore important to add your own stamp on a title by changing its unique parameters, at least a little. To the left of the <strong class="bold">Text</strong> icon at the top of the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong>, you'll find the <strong class="bold">Title</strong> icon, a <strong class="bold">T</strong> in a box, and the <strong class="bold">Title</strong> section is where you'll make changes to the specific options that each title allows. This blue icon is what you're looking for:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer745" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_15.22_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.22: Select the Title tab to exami<span>ne unique </span>&#13;
settings and any built-in<span> animation</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Basic Title</strong> and <strong class="bold">Basic Lower Third</strong> titles don't actually include any settings here, so you'll need to add in something else. While many titles do include some settings, the <strong class="bold">Custom</strong> title is the king of them all. As it only includes a single text element, if you want two independent lines with different styles you can add two titles one above the other, or type two lines of text, and select and format each line independently. We'll add it now, as follows:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Click on the <strong class="bold">Build In/Out</strong> title<span> category.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Drag the <strong class="bold">Custom</strong> title to a spot above the primary <span>storyline.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Viewer</strong>, double-click on the word <strong class="bold">Title</strong> to edit it, then overtype with your <span>own title.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Click on<a id="_idIndexMarker1281"/> the <strong class="bold">Text</strong> icon in the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> (the <a id="_idIndexMarker1282"/>small lines), then choose one of the text presets you saved earlier, such as <strong class="bold">Big Av</strong><span><strong class="bold">enir Bold</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Title</strong> icon in the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> (the <strong class="bold">T</strong> in a box) to see all the other<span> controls.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Custom</strong> title exposes far more controls than most other titles, with more flexibility than most. The <strong class="bold">In</strong> settings here govern the initial state of the text as it builds in, animating to a "normal" appearance. After a short period of normality for viewers to read the text, the <strong class="bold">Out</strong> settings then govern the final state of the text as it builds out. Right now, though, the In and Out settings aren't doing anything at all.</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Change <strong class="bold">In Opacity</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>, <strong class="bold">In Scale</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">60</strong>, and <strong class="bold">In B</strong><span><strong class="bold">lur</strong></span><span> to </span><span><strong class="source-inline">20</strong></span><span>.</span><p>Because the <strong class="bold">Blur</strong> slider has a limit of <strong class="source-inline">10</strong>, that last change can only be done by dragging on the numbers directly, or selecting the number and typing in a new value. Always drag on the numbers for quickest results.</p><p>The settings can be seen here:</p><div id="_idContainer746" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_15.23_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.23: During playback, the "h" is now unblurring as it grows an<span>d fades in</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Timeline</strong>, click above the start of this title and press the <strong class="bold">spacebar</strong> to start<span> playback.</span><p>You'll see that<a id="_idIndexMarker1283"/> the text fades in as it grows and <a id="_idIndexMarker1284"/>unblurs. You could use any of these settings on their own, but they also look good together. Currently, only one letter animates at a time, though, and we can soften that.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Make sure the title is still selected, and click back to the <strong class="bold">Title</strong> tab if <span>necessary.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Change <strong class="bold">In Sp</strong><span><strong class="bold">read</strong></span><span> to </span><span><strong class="source-inline">5</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>The <strong class="bold">In Spread</strong> value controls how many elements animate onto the screen at once, and you can change the <strong class="bold">In Unit Size</strong> parameter to fade words, lines, or everything rather than just characters.</p>&#13;
			<p>You can see the change here:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer747" class="figure">&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.24: Now, several characters animate at the<span> same time</span></p>&#13;
			<p>You can tweak this title all day to produce unique results, and it's a great way to add your own touch to a simple title. While the <strong class="bold">Out</strong> controls do work, you may need to experiment <a id="_idIndexMarker1285"/>with the <strong class="bold">Custom</strong> title's duration to get the<a id="_idIndexMarker1286"/> fade out to happen in exactly the right place. Often, I'll build a title in to grab attention, but then just hard cut it out with a shot change underneath:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer748" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_15.25_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.25: Often, a shot change is a good opportunity to hard cut away fr<span>om a title</span></p>&#13;
			<p>While <strong class="bold">Custom</strong> can be a little complicated to fade out, most animated titles offer simple checkboxes for <strong class="bold">Build In</strong> and <strong class="bold">Build Out</strong> that make this easy, as seen here: </p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer749" class="figure">&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.26: Here's Pixie Dust, with optional Build In and Build Out <span>parameters</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Another option is to use a transition to build it away; after all, there's a huge range of unusual transitions included. It's possible to add a transition (<strong class="bold">⌘T</strong> for the default <strong class="bold">Cross Dissolve</strong>) to build it in and out, but you'll see that the title gets much taller, as it will be placed in a connected storyline. (Transitions can only be added within a storyline, so one will always be created if you add a transition to a connected title.) You'll see this:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer750" class="figure">&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.27: To fade this title out earlier, use the Title controls, or perhaps add a <span>transition</span></p>&#13;
			<p>If you'd prefer to <a id="_idIndexMarker1287"/>keep the original small height of a connected <a id="_idIndexMarker1288"/>title, you could use the Opacity fade handles found in <strong class="bold">Video Animation</strong> (<strong class="bold">⌃V</strong>) instead, as seen here:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer751" class="figure">&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.28: If you use the Video Animation Opacity fade handles, the clip stays at a regu<span>lar height</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Of course, this will only help you to fade a title as a single unit, and as you're about to find out, there are <a id="_idIndexMarker1289"/>more exciting ways to transition text. Here are<a id="_idIndexMarker1290"/> some of the best included title templates.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-434"><a id="_idTextAnchor454"/>The best titles</h2>&#13;
			<p>In this section, you'll find<a id="_idIndexMarker1291"/> out about some of the hidden gems of the built-in titles. Remember to customize all these titles to see their true potential, and as you're trying out new titles, here's a shortcut:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Select an existing title, then double-click a replacement in the <strong class="bold">Title</strong><span> browser. </span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>The existing title will be replaced with a new one, and any text previously entered will be copied across.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-435"><a id="_idTextAnchor455"/>3D</h3>&#13;
			<p>If a 3D title is<a id="_idIndexMarker1292"/> appropriate for your Project, start here. The <strong class="bold">Basic 3D</strong> title isn't entirely <a id="_idIndexMarker1293"/>bare-bones like its 2D equivalent; it includes several different animation styles such as slides, zooms, swivels, and tumbles:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer752" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_15.29_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.29: A Custom 3D example with different formatting for the first and se<span>cond lines</span></p>&#13;
			<p>For more control, go for <strong class="bold">Custom 3D</strong>, starting from scratch but letting you add anything you want to the <strong class="bold">In </strong>or <strong class="bold">Out</strong> builds. For simpler controls over a single type of animation, use <strong class="bold">Fade 3D</strong>, <strong class="bold">Rotate 3D</strong>, <strong class="bold">Scale 3D</strong>, <strong class="bold">Text Spacing 3D</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Tumble 3D</strong>, and the <strong class="bold">Lower Third 3D</strong> provides<a id="_idIndexMarker1294"/> two <a id="_idIndexMarker1295"/>lines and a blurry gray bar. These are all good.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-436"><a id="_idTextAnchor456"/>3D Cinematic</h3>&#13;
			<p>Less flexible than<a id="_idIndexMarker1296"/> the regular <strong class="bold">3D</strong> category, these effects are quite <a id="_idIndexMarker1297"/>distinctive and should be used sparingly. Here's Graphical:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer753" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_15.30_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.30: This Graphical title punches the text through from the background, wi<span>th shadows</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Shadow</strong> title has some versatile options, as does the <strong class="bold">Graphi</strong><strong class="bold">cal</strong> title.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-437"><a id="_idTextAnchor457"/>Build In/Out</h3>&#13;
			<p>Probably one of the <a id="_idIndexMarker1298"/>most versatile categories, including several simple <a id="_idIndexMarker1299"/>yet effective options. Try <strong class="bold">Blur</strong>, to unblur the text in then blur it away; <strong class="bold">Continuous</strong>, with several persistent options under the <strong class="bold">Style</strong> drop-down option; and <strong class="bold">Custom</strong>, which we have already explored. Here's <strong class="bold">Knock Out</strong>:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer754" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_15.31_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.31: Knock Out repeats a trick which Blend Modes can do, but with some useful ani<span>mation too</span></p>&#13;
			<p><strong class="bold">Fade</strong> is a simplified version of <strong class="bold">Custom</strong> with only opacity controls; <strong class="bold">Highlight</strong> provides a passing sparkle; and <strong class="bold">Knock Out</strong> shows the video behind it. <strong class="bold">Soft Edge</strong> provides a paragraph of text <a id="_idIndexMarker1300"/>with a little movement, and <strong class="bold">Tracking</strong> stretches the<a id="_idIndexMarker1301"/> text in and out as it fades. Here's an example of <strong class="bold">Tracking </strong>in action:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer755" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_15.32_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.32: Tracking, in mid-animation, is a pop<span>ular style</span></p>&#13;
			<p>While there are several <a id="_idIndexMarker1302"/>other options here, they're quite distinctive, so be sure <a id="_idIndexMarker1303"/>not to overuse them.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-438"><a id="_idTextAnchor458"/>Bumper/Opener</h3>&#13;
			<p>Many of these options <a id="_idIndexMarker1304"/>bring a lot of their own style, but you can <a id="_idIndexMarker1305"/>make them your own. Try <strong class="bold">Ink</strong>, then change the font, the background, and the <strong class="bold">Ink Dab Width</strong>. Here's an example of that:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer756" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_15.33_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.33: The Slate background on Ink looks very different from th<span>e defaults</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Look to the themed collections below the standalone Titles to see related options, such as the <strong class="bold">Data</strong> theme's <strong class="bold">Reveal</strong> and <strong class="bold">Endpage</strong> options, and the <strong class="bold">Event</strong> theme's <strong class="bold">List</strong>, <strong class="bold">Push</strong> and <strong class="bold">Ribbon</strong> options. All of these options are changeable.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-439"><a id="_idTextAnchor459"/>Credits</h3>&#13;
			<p>If you want to add <a id="_idIndexMarker1306"/>scrolling credits to your piece, <strong class="bold">Scrolling</strong> will automatically retime <a id="_idIndexMarker1307"/>the text you provide to the duration you allow. Below this, several themes here can manipulate everything in the timeline under the title, allowing the camera to zoom out with a <strong class="bold">Push</strong>, <strong class="bold">Turn</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Slide</strong> to reveal that you've been watching a <strong class="bold">Comic Book</strong>, or a <strong class="bold">Photo Album</strong>, or a <strong class="bold">Scrapbook</strong>. These are best used as connected titles to include the Primary Storyline within them. An example of the <strong class="bold">Turn</strong> option can be seen in the following screenshot:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer757" class="figure">&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.34: Your video can become a postcard if you use Bulletin Board's <span>Turn title</span></p>&#13;
			<p>If you do find a title that includes the background as this does, be sure to avoid using its <strong class="bold">Transform</strong> controls, as they will affect not just the text but the entire image. This occurs because they <a id="_idIndexMarker1308"/>make use of the same background-controlling feature that<a id="_idIndexMarker1309"/> enables Adjustment Layers, as discussed in <a href="B15343_11_PreFinal_Apple_SK+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor296"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, <em class="italic">Play with Light: Color Correction an</em><em class="italic">d Grading</em>.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-440"><a id="_idTextAnchor460"/>Elements</h3>&#13;
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Instant Replay</strong>, <strong class="bold">Score</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Stats</strong> options are all useful for sports, while <strong class="bold">Speech Bubbles</strong> can be handy<a id="_idIndexMarker1310"/> to present a character's idea in a comic book <a id="_idIndexMarker1311"/>style. &#13;
Here's another:</p>&#13;

			<p>This section is <a id="_idIndexMarker1312"/>probably the most useful, because the primary use for these <a id="_idIndexMarker1313"/>titles is to give your subjects a name and a caption. <strong class="bold">Gradient – Edge</strong> and <strong class="bold">Gradient – Center</strong> are useful, simple options with controls over the size and position of a gradient bar:</p>&#13;

			<p>This new and useful <a id="_idIndexMarker1316"/>category of titles is a great choice if you're creating<a id="_idIndexMarker1317"/> movies that will change aspect ratio: these titles will adapt if your project changes shape, from wide to tall or square. Several of these titles also include a spot for a logo by utilizing Drop Zones, which you'll learn about soon, and others include a "bump," pushing in the underlying video for emphasis.</p>&#13;

			<p>That probably<a id="_idIndexMarker1320"/> felt like a lot of information, but it should have made <a id="_idIndexMarker1321"/>sense. As well as understanding the full range of titles available, you know how to find the Titles Browser, then preview a title and add it to your timeline. You also know how to set the text properties, and how to save or recall formatting presets. With the formatting out of the way, you can attack the specific animation properties of that particular title, make it unique, and make sure it stands out for the right reasons.</p>&#13;
			<p>What next? Some advanced techniques that will get you out of a jam someday.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-444"><a id="_idTextAnchor465"/>Advanced title techniques</h1>&#13;
			<p>In this section, you'll learn<a id="_idIndexMarker1322"/> how to find and replace text across all titles, how to retime titles to insert pauses or control speed, and how to reuse a complex composite of several titles and other elements. While you won't use these techniques in every Project, if you ever have to incorporate bullet points or correct a typo in someone's name, these are the tools you'll need. You'll also discover how to use Drop Zones to include a clip as part of a title. First up, replacing text.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-445"><a id="_idTextAnchor466"/>Replacing text in titles</h2>&#13;
			<p>Text replacement <a id="_idIndexMarker1323"/>is quite easy, but it's still worth mentioning. To replace one word with another in a Project (or all Projects), follow these steps:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Choose <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Find and Replace Title Text</strong> to<span> see this:</span><div id="_idContainer763" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_15.40_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.40: Here, I'm searching for an abbreviation and re<span>placing it</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>In the dialog that appears, type in the word(s) to search for and the re<span>placement.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Click <strong class="bold">Next</strong> to move to the first instance, to confirm that it's been found <span>correctly.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Click <strong class="bold">Replace &amp; Find</strong> to replace one instance and move to the next, <strong class="bold">Replace</strong> to replace and not move on, or <strong class="bold">Replace All</strong> to make all replacements. (If only one instance is found, you can only select <strong class="bold">Rep</strong><span><strong class="bold">lace All</strong></span><span>).</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>If the new text is longer than the old text, it's possible that not all the new text will fit. If this is the case, use <strong class="bold">Replace</strong> and check that it's good before moving on to the next instance. There's another way to search that can be useful, but it only finds text in the first text element within a title. To search with the Timeline Index:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Press <strong class="bold">⌘F</strong> to open the search field in the <strong class="bold">Timel</strong><span><strong class="bold">ine Index</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Click <strong class="bold">Clips</strong> at the top of <span>the panel.</span><p>Optionally, you could click <strong class="bold">Titles</strong> at the bottom of the panel to limit the search further.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Click in the search field at the top, then type the word(s) you want to s<span>earch for.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>If you have already replaced these same words in the titles (or they're in the second Description line in a lower third), you shouldn't find anything. However, you can search for more than just text in titles here: names of clips and text in captions can both be found this way, as <a id="_idIndexMarker1324"/>illustrated:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer764" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_15.41_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.41: Trying out a few titles? They'll a<span>ll be here</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Of these two options, <strong class="bold">Find and Replace Title Text</strong> is more powerful because it searches through multiple text elements within titles, and also because you can replace text across multiple Projects at once. The <strong class="bold">Find</strong> feature searches only the current Project, and you may need to replace text in more than one Project. But it's important: remember that if you're correcting a misspelled title, that same text may appear in captions too, and you should fix both. (If you haven't added captions, no problem — they're coming up soon!)</p>&#13;
			<p>Now that typos are <a id="_idIndexMarker1325"/>under control, how can you present a bulleted list properly?</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-446"><a id="_idTextAnchor467"/>Retiming titles with Compound Clips</h2>&#13;
			<p>Bulleted lists<a id="_idIndexMarker1326"/> aren't the most exciting way to<a id="_idIndexMarker1327"/> present information, but they can be a necessary evil. If a Project demands that you retime multiple bullet points to match a voiceover or a presenter on screen, here's how to do it:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Create a <strong class="bold">Custom</strong> title with all the bullet points<span> included.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Adjust the <strong class="bold">Custom</strong> title's animation to animate in a character at a time, with <strong class="bold">Spread</strong> at <strong class="source-inline">1</strong>, <strong class="bold">In Opacity</strong> at <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>, and <strong class="bold">In B</strong><span><strong class="bold">lur</strong></span><span> at </span><span><strong class="source-inline">10</strong></span><span>.</span><p>You could use <strong class="bold">In Fade</strong>, <strong class="bold">In Position</strong>, or anything else you like, but make sure that only one element is animating at any one time. Animation by line or character is OK.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Select that title in a<span> timeline.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">⌥G</strong> to create a Compound Clip, the<span>n name it.</span><p>Creating a Compound Clip is the key here. While a title can't be paused and will stretch out to the time given, a Compound Clip is fixed and can be retimed easily. The following screenshot shows how to create one:</p><div id="_idContainer765" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_15.42_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.42: I like to use "CC" in the name of Comp<span>ound Clips</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Skim to the frame immediately after the first bullet point has fully<span> appeared.</span><p>Make sure the second bullet point isn't visible yet.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">⇧H </strong>to create a <strong class="bold">Hold Frame</strong> at t<span>hat point.</span><p>The <strong class="bold">Retime Editor</strong> now appears above the clip with a red area to indicate the Hold Frame.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Skim to a frame at the end of each subsequent bullet point, and press <strong class="bold">⇧H</strong> to create a <strong class="bold">Hold Frame</strong> at each one,<span> as shown:</span><div id="_idContainer766" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_15.43_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.43: With all the Hold Frames in position, you'l<span>l see this</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Drag the single-line handle at the right of each red area (from left to right) to change the duration of each H<span>old Frame:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer767" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_15.44_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.44: After extending the length of each Hold Frame, you'l<span>l see this</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The length of time<a id="_idIndexMarker1328"/> that each bullet point stays<a id="_idIndexMarker1329"/> fixed on screen is up to you: adjust the timing to fit a voiceover or an onscreen presenter. The single-line handle can be dragged as far to the left or right as you need to adjust the length of the pause before the next bullet animates on.</p>&#13;
			<p>What if you've been given a video recording of a presentation rather than titles you created? The same <strong class="bold">⇧H</strong> technique for adding Hold Frames lets you pause in the same way, but you won't need to make a compound clip first.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">For these pre-recorded presentations, an additional trick can help to remove the background easily. If your presentation uses white text on a black background, the <strong class="bold">Screen</strong> blend mode will remove the background, leaving only the white text. This means that rather than placing a presentation in a box next to your presenter, you can integrate the two in the same frame.</p>&#13;
			<p>Bulleted lists are one thing, but are Compound Clips good for any other title-related tasks? I'm glad you asked.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-447"><a id="_idTextAnchor468"/>Creating complex titles with Compound Clips</h2>&#13;
			<p>Compound Clips can<a id="_idIndexMarker1330"/> turn<a id="_idIndexMarker1331"/> any number of titles into a single unit that can be reused and retimed, and the most common workflow they enable is easy reuse of common title elements across different Projects in a series.</p>&#13;
			<p>Some titles, such as an introductory bumper title, will be used unchanged in a series of different videos, and wrapping a common bumper in a compound clip is sensible: if the bumper needs to change late in the process, you only need to edit that one Compound Clip, not a loose title (or several layered clips) at the start of every edit. This simplifies your timeline too:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer768" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_15.45_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.45: Here's a composite of a few clips and a title in a compound below, with a changing t<span>itle above</span></p>&#13;
			<p>A hybrid approach can also work, involving a composite of several elements you expect to remain the same, and one or more titles on top that will change each time. To reuse only some elements of a complex multilayered title, a good approach is to create a "base" Compound Clip with all the common elements, then change additional elements on top of each instance. A background generator with a fixed logo and two different text elements would be a good candidate for this — you could put the logo and background together in a compound, then add two independent titles on top. When you reuse it, copy the entire chunk, then double-click each title and change them.</p>&#13;
			<p>Remember: editing any underlying Compound Clip causes changes to ripple through to all instances of it. Compound Clips are therefore a sensible choice if you expect there to be changes, such as when you just haven't had time to design a background behind a title yet, and you're going with something basic for now.</p>&#13;
			<p>While you'll mostly want to use reuse a compound clip across multiple Projects, it's also possible for each instance of a compound clip to be independent of other instances. One way to do this is to duplicate your Compound Clip a few times in the Browser, then place each independent duplicate where you want them. You'll see something like this:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer769" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_15.46_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.46: Three different versions of a titl<span>e can all </span>&#13;
be used and edited separately<span> if needed</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Another way to create independent Compound Clips is to select a single Compound Clip instance in a timeline, then choose <strong class="bold">Clip &gt; Reference New Parent Clip</strong>, which creates a duplicate compound clip in the Browser for you, then points the selected timeline copy at the new duplicate. Neat.</p>&#13;
			<p>Either way, you'll find it easy enough to use Compound Clips as a wrapper for one or more titles. They enable easy reuse of one or more assets, and can be duplicated and edited independently if you want something more complicated.</p>&#13;
			<p>Another way to<a id="_idIndexMarker1332"/> manage<a id="_idIndexMarker1333"/> complexity within a title or generator is to incorporate another element (a regular clip or a compound clip) inside it, and allow the editor to scale and reposition that element. That magic happens through <strong class="bold">D</strong><strong class="bold">rop Zones</strong>.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-448"><a id="_idTextAnchor469"/>Using Drop Zones</h2>&#13;
			<p>Drop Zones allow <a id="_idIndexMarker1334"/>you to include one or more <a id="_idIndexMarker1335"/>additional clips within a title — or, indeed, within a generator, or even a transition. Titles can already include the clip below them, though: in the <strong class="bold">Bumper/Opener</strong> category, there's a title called <strong class="bold">Keynote</strong> that moves whatever's placed underneath it to the left, and then introduces text to the right with a gradient background. Drop Zones allow you to bring in another clip entirely, and you'll find one in <strong class="bold">Bold Fin</strong>, also in the <strong class="bold">Bumper/Opener</strong> category. Let's explore it through an exercise, as follows:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Add the <strong class="bold">Bold Fin</strong> title above an existing clip in your<span> timeline.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Double-click the title to select it and move the Playhead to i<span>ts center.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Overtype the selected text element, then double-click and change the other elements. (Type a space if you want an element le<span>ft blank.)</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Title</strong> tab (the <strong class="bold">T</strong> in a box) at the top of the <span><strong class="bold">Inspector</strong></span><span>.</span><p>You'll see several controls, including a <strong class="bold">Media Well Inset</strong> control, currently set to <em class="italic">No source</em>. This is a Drop Zone that you'll add your own clip to:</p><div id="_idContainer770" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_15.47_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.47: Here's a title you could use just before a commer<span>cial break</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Click in the <strong class="bold">Image Well</strong> next<a id="_idIndexMarker1336"/> to <strong class="bold">Media Well Inset</strong>, where the downward-pointing <a id="_idIndexMarker1337"/>arrow<span> is shown.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Library</strong> icon in the top left of the <strong class="bold">Browser</strong> to access y<span>our clips.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Click on the filmstrip of a clip (not just its name) to load it into the I<span>mage Well.</span><p>It's possible to use a Browser clip or a timeline clip as the source. Importantly, the frame you click on is the first frame that will be used in the Drop Zone, so be sure to click on the section of the clip that you want to see first. If you click late in a clip, you could see a still frame at the end if the clip isn't long enough. At this stage, you should see something like this:</p><div id="_idContainer771" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_15.48_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.48: Click on a clip in the Browser to see it play in this Viewer sp<span>lit screen</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Click <strong class="bold">Apply Clip</strong> to the lower left of the <strong class="bold">Viewer</strong> to confirm t<span>he choice.</span><p>Note that if several Drop Zones are present, you can click on each one, then click on a source clip each time, and finally click <strong class="bold">Apply Clip</strong> once to approve them all.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Play back the<a id="_idIndexMarker1338"/> title in the timeline to<a id="_idIndexMarker1339"/> see (but not hear) the clip in the <span>Drop Zone.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Pause, then double-click the Drop Zone in the <strong class="bold">Viewer</strong> to <span>select it.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Scale the clip up by dragging the corners of the Drop Zone, and reposition it by dragging it, as <span>seen here:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.49: Content in a Drop Zone can be scaled and re<span>positioned</span></p>&#13;
			<p>If you can see a Drop Zone, you should be able to double-click it, change its scale, and re-crop it easily. However, in some complex titles with overlapping elements, double-clicking on the right element can be difficult, and you might prefer to use Inspector-based <strong class="bold">Pan</strong> and <strong class="bold">Scale</strong> controls, like these:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer773" class="figure">&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.50: A third-party "gallery" Generator might use many Drop Zones and Inspector <span>parameters</span></p>&#13;
			<p>A trickier issue is <a id="_idIndexMarker1340"/>timing. Sometimes, it can be difficult<a id="_idIndexMarker1341"/> to put exactly the right region of a clip in a Drop Zone, and this can happen for subtle reasons. Firstly, the clip will always play at normal speed, while other elements in the clip will retime themselves to match the duration of the clip. Secondly, the Drop Zone may start to play before it is visible, so you may see content in the clip that appears some time after the exact frame you clicked on.</p>&#13;
			<p>A nice workaround is to create a Compound Clip from the source clip that you place inside a Drop Zone. That way, you can Slip the content of the Compound Clip in time (or even retime it) to make sure that exactly the right part of the clip is used. This strategy can be important with dealing with long, complex animations such as this:</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.51: This is only part of a long animated<span> sequence </span>&#13;
with 20+ Drop Zones, from<span> motionVFX</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Drop Zones are more frequently used in third-party Titles (and Generators) but you'll also find them in the <strong class="bold">Build In/Out</strong> category's <strong class="bold">Fold</strong>, in the <strong class="bold">Bumper/Opener</strong> category's <strong class="bold">Stacked</strong>, and <a id="_idIndexMarker1342"/>elsewhere in the <strong class="bold">Sports</strong> theme. They're <a id="_idIndexMarker1343"/>worth using, though the innate ability of Titles to repurpose the content beneath them means that you won't always have to.</p>&#13;
			<p>Time for a quick look back.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-449"><a id="_idTextAnchor470"/>Review — Advanced title techniques</h2>&#13;
			<p><strong class="bold">Find and Replace Title Text</strong> is one<a id="_idIndexMarker1344"/> of the boring but necessary features that will save your bacon at some point, and Compound Clips are too. Bulleted lists are one occasion you'll need them, but a bigger reason is to ensure that you deliver consistent titles and bumpers over time.</p>&#13;
			<p>Many jobs are repeat jobs, either multiple videos in a single larger job or multiple similar videos for a single client. For any repeat jobs, consider creating Compound Clips to ensure consistency. If you'll be working with a client for many years, also consider making a dedicated library to hold those Compound Clips, to make it easier to reuse them across multiple libraries.</p>&#13;
			<p>Now that you know how to replace text, how to use Compound Clips for retiming and reuse, and how to place, size, crop, and retime Drop Zones, you're all set. And yet, titles aren't always enough, so you'll also want to be across <strong class="bold">Generators</strong>, up next.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-450"><a id="_idTextAnchor471"/>Adding and editing generators</h1>&#13;
			<p>While titles generally add text, Generators generally add background elements: images, generated graphics, patterns, or something else. Here, you'll learn how to add and edit Generators, including some of the fancier controls accessible in the Inspector and the Viewer. Finally, you'll find out about some of the best Generators included with the app, remembering of course that there are plenty of free and cheap third-party Generators out there too.</p>&#13;
			<p>The most common uses for Generators are to stand in for other content (such as the Placeholder generator, which you learned about back in <a href="B15343_06_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor164"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Build the Spine of the Story: Quick Assembly</em>) or to act as a background behind other elements such as titles or keyed green-screen shots. But some types of videos, such as slideshows, might be built entirely from Generators — they can do quite a bit.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">An alternative to Generators is to use real still images or video instead — possibly stock photos or stock footage. Before you do, consider if it's projecting the right message; the generic, staged look that many stock shots and clips share can feel dated. You can find good imagery at free stock libraries such as <a href="http://pexels.com">pexels.com</a>, <a href="http://unsplash.com">unsplash.com</a>, and <a href="http://pixabay.com">pixabay.com</a>, though paid stock libraries offer a wider range of choices.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">However, always remember that anyone can access the same clips that you can. Shooting your own stills or video will always ensure a unique result.</p>&#13;
			<p>You'll find Generators to be largely similar to Titles, but with some key differences. Some are animated while others are static; some offer many controls while others offer none. We'll start by adding some Generators, then move on to editing them.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-451"><a id="_idTextAnchor472"/>Adding and editing a simple Generator</h2>&#13;
			<p>The simplest<a id="_idIndexMarker1345"/> way to get started with Generators is to add one of the most useful<a id="_idIndexMarker1346"/> ones, and here's how:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">If it's not already visible, click on the <strong class="bold">Titles and Generators</strong> icon at the top of the <strong class="bold">Browser</strong> (the third icon), as illustr<span>ated here:</span><div id="_idContainer775" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_15.52_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.52: Once more to Titles and <span>Generators</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Browser</strong>, click the small disclosure triangle next to the word <strong class="bold">Generators</strong>, to expose the categori<span>es within.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Solids</strong><span> category.</span><p>As with titles, all these Generators can be previewed by hovering over them, though only their default state will be visible:</p><div id="_idContainer776" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_15.53_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.53: The Solids generators aren't flashy, but they <span>are useful</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Drag <strong class="bold">Custom</strong> to a spot in the Primary <span>Storyline.</span><p><strong class="bold">Custom</strong> defaults to a black background, but we can change that now.</p></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">⌥-click</strong> on the new <strong class="bold">Custom</strong> clip in the timeline to select the clip and move the Playhead to t<span>hat point.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong>, click on the first icon to the left — the <strong class="bold">Gene</strong><span><strong class="bold">rator</strong></span><span> tab.</span><p>There's only one item here: the color of the background. You can click on the <strong class="bold">Color</strong> box to bring up the macOS color picker, or the small arrow to the right to bring up a small color-picking spectrum. Both are shown here: </p><div id="_idContainer777" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_15.54_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.54: Both the macOS color picker and the quick color picker are <span>shown here</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Click on the <a id="_idIndexMarker1347"/>box (not the arrow) to bring up the macOS col<span>or </span><span><a id="_idIndexMarker1348"/></span><span>picker.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Click on the small eyedropper icon in the macOS color picker to activate the system e<span>yedropper.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Click on any color anywhere on the screen to <span>sample it.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>This technique allows you to use any color you like behind a title. Of course, if you prefer, you could use a still image or a low-contrast video, or a video with a blur effect applied instead — but a solid color is still a popular choice. Still, there are many more complex generators with many more settings to change.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-452"><a id="_idTextAnchor473"/>Changing advanced Generator settings</h2>&#13;
			<p>Just as with titles, each<a id="_idIndexMarker1349"/> Generator offers its own set of controls. You'll find them in the <strong class="bold">Generator</strong> tab at the top left of the Inspector, and as this process is very similar to how you would change the Title properties on a title, I won't go into too much detail. Briefly, you'll need to do the following:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">⌥-click</strong> on a Generator clip in the timeline to select the clip and move the Playhead to t<span>hat point.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong>, click on the first icon to the left — the <strong class="bold">Generator</strong> tab. The following screenshot shows an example of the <strong class="bold">Clouds</strong> <span>Generator:</span><div id="_idContainer778" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_15.55_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.55: The Clouds Generator offers a partly transparent ba<span>ckground, </span>&#13;
just visible here as a ch<span>eckerboard</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>To change a <a id="_idIndexMarker1350"/>Generator's settings, drag on a property's numbers, choose new items from drop-down menus, and choose new colors from the macOS color picker or the built-in square col<span>or picker.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>If a Drop Zone is present, click the image well, then click on a frame in a filmstrip of a browser clip and click on <strong class="bold">A</strong><span><strong class="bold">pply Clip</strong></span><span>.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>If desired, add color correction or video effects to change how the cli<span>p appears.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>There's really nothing difficult here, and if you've played with effects and titles, you shouldn't have any trouble. It's the Inspector; you know what to do. Now, should you always put a Generator on the Primary Storyline? No.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-453"><a id="_idTextAnchor474"/>Positioning a Generator</h2>&#13;
			<p>While in most <a id="_idIndexMarker1351"/>circumstances you <em class="italic">would</em> simply place a Generator on the Primary Storyline and connect a title above it, that's not always the case. One exception is if you're adding a background behind a green-screen shot that now has (thanks to the <strong class="bold">Keyer</strong> effect) a transparent background, as shown here:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer779" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_15.56_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.56: This checkerboard background (indicating transparency) can be shown in Preferences &gt; Player under Player <span>Background</span></p>&#13;
			<p>As this transparent-background shot should be the main clip driving the edit, it should be on the Primary Storyline, and the Generator should be connected underneath it. That way, you can safely edit the main shots without worrying about creating gaps, like this:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer780" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_15.57_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.57: A green-screen clip in the primary and two G<span>enerators </span>&#13;
to create a stripy <span>background</span></p>&#13;
			<p>An exception to this strategy occurs if you need to transition between keyed clips. Sometimes, it's safe to transition between two background elements (in a connected Storyline) at the same time as you transition between two keyed foreground elements (in the primary storyline).</p>&#13;
			<p>This usually works, but for technical reasons some transitions can look strange, as they're expecting to manipulate the entire frame, not just a keyed element. In those cases, create Compound Clips from each foreground-background set, then transition between the two resulting Compound Clips.</p>&#13;
			<p>Now that you know <a id="_idIndexMarker1352"/>where to put Generators and how to integrate them with Compound Clips, here's a list of the best of them.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-454"><a id="_idTextAnchor475"/>The best Generators</h2>&#13;
			<p>While there aren't that<a id="_idIndexMarker1353"/> many Generators included with FCP X, the options here are more flexible than you'd expect. Remember that you can scale, rotate, color-correct, and add effects to any of these to change their look totally, and even animate these properties with keyframes.</p>&#13;
			<p>Most Generators are fast to work with, but some can be a little complex and might slow down your Project on a slower Mac. If that happens to you, consider exporting a Generator on its own, then re-importing the resulting movie and using it instead.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-455"><a id="_idTextAnchor476"/>360°</h3>&#13;
			<p>These Generators<a id="_idIndexMarker1354"/> are useful if you're working with 360° Projects, but not otherwise.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-456"><a id="_idTextAnchor477"/>Backgrounds</h3>&#13;
			<p>This category has plenty<a id="_idIndexMarker1355"/> of useful options: some organic, some real-world, some abstract, and many themed options. Of the abstract Generators, <strong class="bold">Lines</strong> is extremely flexible, generating animated stripes with several controls, and <strong class="bold">Beam</strong> is surprisingly flexible too. <strong class="bold">Lines</strong> is shown here:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer781" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_15.58_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.58: Lines can be configured in many diff<span>erent ways</span></p>&#13;
			<p><strong class="bold">Blobs</strong>, <strong class="bold">Clouds</strong>, <strong class="bold">Curtain</strong>, <strong class="bold">Organic</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Underwater</strong> are all useful in the right context, but be sure <a id="_idIndexMarker1356"/>to add your own touches with effects or color:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer782" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_15.59_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.59: Useful in context, but change th<span>e settings</span></p>&#13;
			<p>If you've made use of some of the themed transitions (including <strong class="bold">Bulletin Board</strong>, <strong class="bold">Comic Book</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Event</strong>), then consider using their matching backgrounds behind a title.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-457"><a id="_idTextAnchor478"/>Elements</h3>&#13;
			<p>The familiar <strong class="bold">Placeholder</strong> lives<a id="_idIndexMarker1357"/> here, but it's still quicker to add it with <strong class="bold">⌥⌘W</strong>. You'll also find <strong class="bold">Counting</strong>, a great way to create numbers that count up or down; <strong class="bold">Timecode</strong>, to display the Project or clip timecode for technical purposes; and <strong class="bold">Shapes</strong>, to create one of several kinds of shapes with controllable fill, outline, and shadow:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer783" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_15.60_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.60: Two Shapes above some purpl<span>e Curtains</span></p>&#13;
			<p>When used with <a id="_idIndexMarker1358"/>blend modes inside a Compound Clip, the <strong class="bold">Shapes</strong> Generator is perfect for placing video inside a random shape.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-458"><a id="_idTextAnchor479"/>Solids</h3>&#13;
			<p>You know about the <strong class="bold">Custom</strong> Generator <a id="_idIndexMarker1359"/>already, and it's the best option here. The others (<strong class="bold">Whites</strong>, <strong class="bold">Pastel</strong>, <strong class="bold">Vivid</strong>, and so on) offer solid colors from drop-down menus, but the macOS color picker is more useful.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-459"><a id="_idTextAnchor480"/>Textures</h3>&#13;
			<p><strong class="bold">Gradient</strong> is a good <a id="_idIndexMarker1360"/>option when a flat color is too boring, but you want to stay with a simple, synthetic look. Most of the other options (<strong class="bold">Fabric</strong>, <strong class="bold">Grunge</strong>, <strong class="bold">Metal</strong>, <strong class="bold">Natural</strong>, <strong class="bold">Paper</strong>, <strong class="bold">Stone</strong>, <strong class="bold">Wood</strong>) follow the same template, offering a menu with several themed background choices and an optional tint. Pretty pictures at your fingertips:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer784" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_15.61_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.61: One of many images in the Natural<span> generator</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The remaining Generators here are essentially a single still image, and of course there's an entire world of high-quality free and paid still images out there you could be using instead.</p>&#13;
			<p>That's it for the <a id="_idIndexMarker1361"/>built-in Generators, but of course you'll find third-party ones for purchase and for free online. Note that Generators are sometimes packaged as Titles to gain access to their background-manipulating powers, so check in the Titles Browser if you can't find what you're looking for in the Generators Browser.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-460"><a id="_idTextAnchor481"/>Review — Adding and editing generators</h2>&#13;
			<p>Backgrounds are<a id="_idIndexMarker1362"/> important behind many opening titles, and if video's not appropriate, generators are often a good answer. The <strong class="bold">Placeholder</strong> Generator is especially useful when you haven't shot the video yet, but there are plenty of other ways to fill in a gap. As with titles and effects, be sure to change the default settings so that you aren't using exactly the same Generators as everyone else.</p>&#13;
			<p>You're very nearly finished with your edit, and it's time to explore captions.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-461"><a id="_idTextAnchor482"/>Captioning and subtitles</h1>&#13;
			<p>In this section, you'll <a id="_idIndexMarker1363"/>learn how to put words at the bottom of the screen, for people <a id="_idIndexMarker1364"/>who either can't hear the audio, choose not to hear the audio, or don't understand the audio. This isn't a small audience either; a huge number (around 90%!) of social media viewers watch videos without sound, at least initially, and captions can fill the gap:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer785" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_15.62_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.62: Automatically generated captions aren't terribly accurate<span> or pretty</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Captioning is therefore incredibly important if you're creating videos that people didn't ask to see, and of course captions are important for accessibility. Before we continue, it's important to understand that captions aren't quite the same as subtitles, though they do have a lot in common. Have a look at the following description:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Subtitles</strong> are usually intended for a hearing audience, to provide a translation from another<span> language.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Captions</strong> are usually intended for a deaf or hard-of-hearing audience, or for any audience who chooses to watch a video without the audio. Captions may therefore include audio descriptions to indicate music or sound effects, while subtitles <span>would not.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Therefore, the difference between subtitles and captions comes down to content. Both of them are "words on screen", but if you're providing a text version of the audio in the same language, you're probably providing captions rather than subtitles.</p>&#13;
			<p>First, you'll learn <a id="_idIndexMarker1365"/>about caption formats, then how to import them, how to make<a id="_idIndexMarker1366"/> them from scratch, and then how to edit them, including splitting and joining. Exporting will be covered in <a href="B15343_16_PreFinal_Apple_NM+IA_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor491"><em class="italic">Chapter 16</em></a>, <em class="italic">You're Done: Exporting Your Edit and Finishing Up</em>, but there's plenty to learn before we get there. Some groundwork first.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-462"><a id="_idTextAnchor483"/>Understanding caption formats</h2>&#13;
			<p>In practical terms, your <a id="_idIndexMarker1367"/>choice of delivery method is more important to the finished product than the type — subtitles or captions — of the text you're adding. You can create optional Closed Captions, or permanently burned-in Open Captions, as &#13;
detailed here:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Closed Captions</strong> are provided in addition to the video, and can be turned on or off by the viewer. These captions could be in one of several formats and will be delivered in a separate file, or embedded as part of the video container. The playback mechanism (an app, a website, a TV) has to be able to understand the closed caption format to be able to display them. Because the playback device or app generates the captions itself, you have little control over formatting. In fact, the user may be able to change the size and font they prefer, and closed captions will automatically move out of the way of playback controls. As they are text-based, Closed Captions can be indexed by search engines, and even automatically translated to other languages. Here's an example of Closed<span> Captions:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer786" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_15.63_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.63: These Closed Captions (on Vimeo) can be disabled and moved up and down with the playbac<span>k controls</span></p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Open Captions</strong> are burned in to the video, just like regular titles, and cannot be turned on or off by the viewer. However, you have total control over formatting and positioning, just as with any title. Unfortunately, Open Captions placed at the traditional lower third of the screen are likely to be covered up by playback controls. As they are no longer text, Open Captions cannot be indexed by search engines or automatically translated. Here's an example of Open<span> Captions:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer787" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_15.64_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.64: Burned-in Open Captions such as these may be obscured by controls, and they cannot be moved o<span>r disabled</span></p>&#13;
			<p>For the widest use and greatest accessibility, I recommend creating Closed Captions. At export time, you can burn these in to create Open Captions if it's absolutely necessary, but today, more and <a id="_idIndexMarker1368"/>more playback environments can accept Closed Captions. It's the more accessible choice; they're easier to correct if an error is found after exporting; and they return control over the appearance of captions to the user.</p>&#13;
			<p>In technical terms, you can choose to create Closed Captions in one of the following formats:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">iTT</strong> — <strong class="bold">iTunes Timed Text</strong>, used for iTunes Store deliverables. Allows a degree of flexibility with regard to placement and color, but not widely accept<span>ed online.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">CEA-608</strong> — A broadcast standard (<strong class="bold">CEA</strong> stands for <strong class="bold">Consumer Electronics Association</strong>) with a wide degree of control over color and placement, though it appears in a monospaced font in the Viewer. Limited acceptance online, but this is the only caption format that can be embedded as part of an exported file and viewed on an iOS device. It can also be exported independently as an <span><strong class="source-inline">.scc</strong></span><span> file.</span></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">SRT</strong> — A common standard online (<strong class="bold">SRT</strong> stands for <strong class="bold">Secure Reliable Transport</strong>), and though some formatting controls are available, many delivery platforms don't recognize those formatting options. This is the format you want to use for delivery to most online video sharing platforms such as YouTube <span>and Vimeo.</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Note also that that you may need to deliver captions to other standards (including <strong class="bold">WebVTT</strong>, which stands for <strong class="bold">Web Video Text Tracks</strong>), and conversion services &#13;
are available.</p>&#13;
			<p>For a new <strong class="bold">Project</strong>, the <strong class="bold">iTT</strong> format will be active, and <strong class="bold">SRT</strong> will be an option. To use <strong class="bold">CEA-608</strong> captions, you'll need to edit the <strong class="bold">Caption Roles</strong> setting for your Project by choosing <strong class="bold">Modify</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Assign Caption Roles</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Edit Roles</strong> and then pressing the <strong class="bold">plus</strong> to the top right. (Note that switching to <strong class="bold">CEA-608</strong> won't be necessary unless that format has been specifically requested by a client, or you want captions to be embedded directly in<a id="_idIndexMarker1369"/> video files.) Here's an illustration:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer788" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_15.65_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.65: Three caption formats are available; activate a<span>ny format </span>&#13;
(and language) you nee<span>d in Roles</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Multiple languages are supported in the same dialog. Just as a Project can use Subroles within Roles, a Caption Role can include several languages within that format. For now, we'll assume that you're working in English, but of course if you translate your work to other languages, you'll widen its reach.</p>&#13;
			<p>While multiple languages can be accommodated in a single Project, if any changes are needed to other elements (such as visual effects or titles) you may prefer to duplicate the Project instead of juggling Roles or Subroles. Another option is to consider creating an <em class="italic">audio description</em> track so that blind users can understand the visual component of your video.</p>&#13;
			<p>It's important to know that the capabilities of video sharing services and social media platforms vary, and not all of them support Closed Captioning. Therefore, you won't always be able to deliver Closed Captions but will sometimes have to burn them in to create "always on" Open Captions. This list will become outdated as these services and apps become more accessible, but at the time of publication, the following information was accurate:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">YouTube</strong> — accepts SRT; can create captions automatically through audio transcription; allows <a id="_idIndexMarker1370"/>caption editi<span>ng online:</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.66: Captions on YouTube can be edited an<span>d retimed </span>&#13;

			</ul>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer790" class="figure">&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.67: In the Distribution tab on Vimeo, you can add one or more cap<span>tion files</span></p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Twitter</strong> — accepts SRT, but in the app, captions are only shown if audi<span>o is muted</span></li>&#13;

				<li><strong class="bold">TikTok</strong> — doesn't currently accept SRT captions; Open Cap<span>tions only</span></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>The bottom line right now is that if you plan to put your videos online, you'll need to make SRT captions, and if you're going to use Instagram or TikTok, you'll need to burn them in.</p>&#13;
			<p>Social media videos<a id="_idIndexMarker1371"/> often include more titles than other types of videos, and they can happily co-exist with captions. There's no need to duplicate your titles in caption form, but do position your titles so that they won't be hidden by captions, and check how they look on a few different devices to make sure.</p>&#13;
			<p>With that in mind, how do you actually create your captions? You have a few options.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-463"><a id="_idTextAnchor484"/>Creating captions</h2>&#13;
			<p>Captions can be created <a id="_idIndexMarker1372"/>one at a time by hand, but a third-party captioning service can enable a much faster workflow. Here, we'll just add a few captions by hand, but if your Project runs for more than a few minutes, you'll probably want to use a third party to create the captions as they'll be much more efficient. While most <a id="_idIndexMarker1373"/>captioning services use <strong class="bold">artificial intelligence </strong>(<strong class="bold">AI</strong>)-powered voice-to-text conversion, you can pay a higher rate for humans to do it instead. Some AI-based options today include <strong class="bold">Simon Says</strong>, <strong class="bold">SpeedScriber</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Scribeomatic</strong>, while <strong class="bold">Rev</strong> offers human translation for a higher cost. </p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">Some transcription services are designed to be involved earlier in the editing process, to allow a rough cut to be created by editing a transcribed text file. While these workflows go beyond the scope of this book, they could save a significant amount of time earlier in the editing process, especially for large-scale documentary work. Third-party services from Lumberjack and Scribeomatic can both enable this workflow.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">Another way to use captions is to use them to make note of client feedback, as you would use <strong class="bold">To Do Markers</strong>. The advantage of captions is that they're shown in the Viewer during playback, while Markers are less visible.</p>&#13;
			<p>As I personally prefer to have the final say over the captions on my work, I use an automated service for the first pass, but check and edit every caption by hand to make sure that even industry jargon is correctly spelled. Computer-powered dictation is improving all the time but won't ever be 100% accurate, and even a human can make mistakes if they're not aware of all the specialist terms and acronyms used in a particular video. As an editor, you should probably be aware of those specialist terms and can fix any problems yourself.</p>&#13;
			<p>To get started creating <a id="_idIndexMarker1374"/>captions, you'll need a video where someone talks; try with a short video first. Here's how:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">In the <strong class="bold">Timeline</strong>, click to place the Playhead when a person starts<span> to speak.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Type <strong class="bold">⌥C</strong> or choose <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Captions</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Ad</strong><span><strong class="bold">d Caption</strong></span><span>.</span><p>A new light-blue caption will be added at the top of the timeline, connected to whatever clip is below it. You'll also see an empty box in which you can type. (Captions should be on by default, but if they're off, choose <strong class="bold">Show Captions</strong> in the <strong class="bold">View</strong> drop-down menu in the <strong class="bold">Viewer</strong>.)</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Type the words that the person speaks into<span> this box.</span><p>It's also possible to use the Inspector to enter text, but I prefer to stay on the timeline for this. If you have an untimed transcript of your video, you can paste the text here instead of typing it, and if the box disappears, double-clicking will bring it back, ready for editing. This is what it will look like:</p><div id="_idContainer791" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_15.68_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.68: Editing a caption on the timeline is a c<span>onvenient </span>&#13;
way to position a<span>nd trim it</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Trim the duration of the caption clip to match the length of the words spoken, up to two line<span>s of text.</span><p>Accurate placement<a id="_idIndexMarker1375"/> and duration are important, for viewers and for standards compliance, and two lines of text is a regularly accepted amount of text to include in a single caption.</p><p>As this is the first caption you've added, you'll also need to set the format from <strong class="bold">iTT</strong> to <strong class="bold">SRT</strong>, easily done at the top of the caption box on the timeline.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>From the small menu at the top of the caption, choose <strong class="bold">English</strong> just <span>under </span><span><strong class="bold">SRT</strong></span><span>:</span><div id="_idContainer792" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_15.69_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.69: Switching format to S<span>RT is easy</span></p><p>A warning pops up, as shown, to let you know that you're changing between formats. That's OK, as we won't be using formatting in SRT captions:</p><div id="_idContainer793" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_15.70_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.70: Formatting isn't as important as accessibility, so <span>this is OK</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Click on <strong class="bold">Continue</strong> in the warning dialog tha<span>t appears.</span><p>As only one caption <a id="_idIndexMarker1376"/>format can be used at one time, new captions will automatically be placed into the <strong class="bold">SRT</strong> format.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Repeat <em class="italic">Steps 2–4</em> to add, edit, and correct duration of captions for all other speech in y<span>our video.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>Captioning by hand isn't painful for a short video but can take a while for a longer video. If you've decided to use an online service to create your captions, the workflow (and cost) can vary widely, but it'll probably go something like this:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Export a low-resolution video or audio file from you<span>r Project.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Upload the file to the conversio<span>n service.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Process<span> the file.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Download an<span> SRT file.</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>Some applications are more tightly integrated with FCP X, and you may be able to obtain captions without leaving the app at all. A free way to obtain (not very good) captions is to upload your video to YouTube, then download its automatically generated captions file. However, I won't document the workflow here as it is expected to change soon, and accuracy is better with inexpensive paid services.</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>&#13;
			<p class="callout">An SRT file, as with most other caption formats, is a text file, and that makes it easy to edit the actual captions with a text editor. Feel free to edit the caption text with TextEdit or another text editor of your choice before importing it to FCP X. Changing the existing text is easy, but the specific numbered formatting can make it difficult to insert new captions or to delete existing captions this way.</p>&#13;
			<p>Whichever method you've used to obtain an SRT file for your Project, you can easily import it with <strong class="bold">File</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Import</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Captions</strong> and then locate the file, with these options:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer794" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_15.71_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.71: Importing generated captions, even if they aren't<span> perfect, </span>&#13;
is a big <span>time saver</span></p>&#13;
			<p>One final alternative<a id="_idIndexMarker1377"/> is that if you're given media with embedded CEA-608 captions, you can extract them to make changes or convert them to other formats. Select the clip, then right-click and choose <strong class="bold">Extract</strong><strong class="bold"> Captions</strong>.</p>&#13;
			<p>With all your captions in place, you'll need to fix up any mistakes, and here's how.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-464"><a id="_idTextAnchor485"/>Editing captions</h2>&#13;
			<p>Editing captions isn't<a id="_idIndexMarker1378"/> just about editing the text of a caption but will also involve splitting long captions and potentially joining shorter captions, as well as adding formatting if you're using a format that supports it.</p>&#13;
			<p>Typing and editing text is straightforward, but beware: some text shortcuts you might be used to are already assigned to operations in FCP X. For example, <strong class="bold">forward delete</strong> will always delete an entire caption, not the character to the right of the text insertion point. The handiest shortcuts are <strong class="bold">⌘</strong><strong class="bold">←</strong> and  <strong class="bold">⌘→</strong> to move between captions; they're the standard shortcuts to jump between clips using the same role, and they'll save you a lot of double-clicking.</p>&#13;
			<p>To split a long caption into multiple smaller captions, follow these steps:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Double-click the caption t<span>o edit it.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Click at the point you want to start a new caption, and press the <strong class="bold">return</strong> key once to create a new paragraph, as illustr<span>ated here:</span><div id="_idContainer795" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_15.72_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.72: Longer captions will be split where the line breaks <span>are placed</span></p></li>&#13;
				<li>Repeat this step to create three lines rather<span> than two.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Right-click the caption and choose <strong class="bold">Split Captions</strong>, as s<span>hown here:</span><div id="_idContainer796" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_15.73_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.73: If you end up splitting captions ofte<span>n, assign </span>&#13;
a more convenient custom keyboard shortcut, as I<span> have here</span></p><p>You will now see <a id="_idIndexMarker1379"/>three captions taking up an equal amount of space on the timeline.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Trim the duration of each caption to make sure they correspond to the correct audio, something <span>like this:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer797" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_15.74_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.74: Trimming captions so that they start and finish at the correct time is<span> important</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The opposite operation is also important: sometimes, you may prefer to combine multiple short statements into a single caption. To join two or more captions, follow these steps:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Drag a selection box around multiple neighboring captions to select them al<span>l at once.</span></li>&#13;
				<li>Right-click any of the captions and choose <strong class="bold">Join</strong><span><strong class="bold"> Captions</strong></span><span>:</span><div id="_idContainer798" class="figure"><img src="Images/Figure_15.75_B15343.jpg" alt=""/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.75: Joining captions is easy, but remember to remove extra return characters if you want lines to ru<span>n together</span></p><p>The captions will<a id="_idIndexMarker1380"/> now become one, taking up all the space covered by the previous captions and any gaps between them.</p></li>&#13;
				<li>Edit the new caption and remove any unwanted return characters by pressing <strong class="bold">delete</strong>, as illustr<span>ated here:</span></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer799" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_15.76_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.76: The first two captions have now been<span> rejoined </span>&#13;
and the extra line bre<span>ak removed</span></p>&#13;
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Join Captions</strong> command doesn't have a shortcut by default, so if you'll be doing this regularly, add a shortcut (to <strong class="bold">Join Clips or Captions</strong>) using <strong class="bold">Final Cut Pro</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Commands</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Customize</strong>.</p>&#13;
			<p>Positioning captions accurately is important: make sure that each caption is correctly timed, appearing with and lasting for the same length as its matching speech. While you won't always get it right the first time, moving and trimming captions is straightforward. Captions can be moved with the mouse just as with any other clips, and trimmed by dragging their edges. You can also nudge them with the <strong class="bold">comma</strong> and <strong class="bold">period</strong> shortcuts, use <strong class="bold">Trim Start</strong> and <strong class="bold">Trim End</strong>, and so on.</p>&#13;
			<p>Normally, captioning is a job done just before final delivery, and so it's unlikely that the edit will change after captioning. But if you do need to edit, you can — even major editing changes can still be made after captioning, due to the magic of the Magnetic Timeline. As you can see in the timeline, captions are connected and will move if their underlying clips move. But crucially, captions can be connected to <em class="italic">connected clips</em>, not just clips on the Primary Storyline, so moving <em class="italic">any</em> clip will move any captions connected to it. To reconnect a<a id="_idIndexMarker1381"/> caption to another clip, or another point on another clip, simply select the caption, then <strong class="bold">⌥⌘-click</strong> where you want the connection point to be placed, like this:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer800" class="figure">&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.77: The first two captions here are connected to the v<span>oiceover, </span>&#13;
making <span>edits easy</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Moving underlying clips can sometimes cause captions to overlap, and this can also happen with an incorrectly formatted SRT file. Overlapping captions will change from blue to red to indicate that they are invalid, because only a single caption can be shown at one time:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer801" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_15.78_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.78: The two red captions here are invalid and should<span> be edited</span></p>&#13;
			<p>To fix this automatically, select both captions together, then right-click and choose <strong class="bold">Resolve Overlaps</strong>. You can also fix it manually by dragging or moving the edge of one caption so that it no longer <a id="_idIndexMarker1382"/>overlaps another, or joining the two captions together if that would be appropriate.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-465"><a id="_idTextAnchor486"/>Understanding standards and formatting</h3>&#13;
			<p>Some standards are more <a id="_idIndexMarker1383"/>restrictive than others. SRT is fairly loose, but with CEA-608, if you use more than four lines of text in the default monospaced font, you'll fail validation and your captions will switch to red, as illustrated here:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer802" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_15.79_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.79: These captions will need a bit of editing to be valid <span>in CEA-608</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Other limits apply to how close your captions can be to the start of the Project or to each other — it's easy for most of your captions to go red if you're not careful, as you can see here:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer803" class="figure">&#13;
					<img src="Images/Figure_15.80_B15343.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.80: Just a couple of the errors you might see listed in the Inspector under an inval<span>id caption</span></p>&#13;
			<p>Even without that <em class="italic">four lines of monospaced text</em> restriction in SRT, try to keep captions to — at most — two lines in the default font in the Viewer. This is only a rough rule of thumb; different players will render the text at different sizes, so your captions can easily spill out over a larger area.</p>&#13;
			<p>Also, make sure to add in captions for music or sound effects. During a conversation, use a dash preceding a line of dialogue, to indicate that the active speaker has changed. Unwanted sounds such as <em class="italic">um</em>, <em class="italic">ah</em>, and breaths can be omitted, as can any obvious minor mistakes or repetitions in what was said.</p>&#13;
			<p>Depending on delivery requirements, you may have to abridge the text if speech is especially quick and/or complex. If you're not sure, check your delivery requirements, which can be quite specific for larger distributors, or simply outsource this job to a professional service.</p>&#13;
			<p>You may have noticed a number of formatting options in the Inspector, but unfortunately, many <a id="_idIndexMarker1384"/>jobs can't make use of them:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer804" class="figure">&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.81: SRT offers italic, underline, placement, and color, but you can't alway<span>s use them</span></p>&#13;
			<p>If you're using the CEA-608 format, formatting can be helpful, and this section will let you use different colors for different speakers or position the captions at the top of the screen to avoid a lower third title. But SRT, the most widely understood option online, doesn't offer the same functionality. YouTube, for example, doesn't display color information in SRT files correctly, and positioning information (top, bottom, and so on) can't even be stored in the format. Sadly, the formatting section is best left alone if you're going to export to SRT.</p>&#13;
			<p>Exporting captions is covered in the next and final chapter, so let's take a quick &#13;
look back.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-466"><a id="_idTextAnchor487"/>Review — Captioning and subtitles</h2>&#13;
			<p>You've learned<a id="_idIndexMarker1385"/> about caption formats and that SRT is probably the way to go if <a id="_idIndexMarker1386"/>you're distributing your video online. You know how to create captions from scratch, but you'll probably have realized that you're better off purchasing your captions for anything over a few minutes, and then editing them.</p>&#13;
			<p>You know that formatting captions is possible but not always useful, and how to edit, reposition, trim, join, and split captions to get good results. Various kinds of deliverables have standards to follow, and for the most particular clients, captions may be something you outsource entirely. But that's OK. The majority of captioning jobs for many people can indeed be handled on your own timeline, and I've certainly handled captions myself on many larger jobs over the last few years.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-467"><a id="_idTextAnchor488"/>Summary</h1>&#13;
			<p>You've learned about a number of ways to augment your videos with words, and backgrounds behind or between those words. Any time there's speech there should be captions, not just because it's a legal requirement in many countries but because it's the right thing to do. And besides captions, good titles can bring so much life to a video that it's simply disappointing to see so many videos that don't do titling well. This is largely because many other NLEs don't have the controls or integration that you can enjoy here, and if a fancy title means outsourcing or juggling another application, many editors don't bother.</p>&#13;
			<p>Do bother! Clients will appreciate that extra effort, and, if used well, a few changes to the <strong class="bold">Custom</strong> title are enough to lift your lower thirds and bumpers way above the norm. Generators, especially if you explore the wild third-party world out there, allow you to perform all kinds of tricks with animated split screens and galleries, so don't overlook them either. A little animation goes a long way:</p>&#13;
