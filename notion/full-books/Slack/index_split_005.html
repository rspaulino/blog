I particularly value the patient guidance they offered about changes required for the work to be able to fulfill its promise. Thanks as well to my agents Emma Parry and Michael Carlisle of Carlisle and Company for help in finding the perfect publisher.</p><p class="calibre_12">The ideas and philosophies that make up <span class="italic">Slack</span> did not come to me out of a vacuum. They were formed and tested over years of interaction with clients and coworkers. Thanks to all of them. For specific insights and (just as important) useful ways to articulate them, I owe a special debt to my colleagues at the Atlantic Systems Guild: Peter Hruschka, Steve McMenamin, John Palmer, James Robertson, and Suzanne Robertson. Each has contributed at least one thing to the book. I am particularly indebted to Tim Lister, who, over the course of nearly twenty-five years of close interaction, has helped to shape my thinking on most aspects of organizational life. (He has sometimes made me go, “Ahah!” so hard it hurt my chest.) Thanks as well to Rob Austin, James Bach, Sheila Brady, Karen Coburn, Allan DeMarco, Ernst Denert, Lesley DeVoe, Rose Ann Giordano, Jim Highsmith, Norm Kerth, Jut Kodner, Ken Orr, Sally O. Smyth, Bruce Taylor, John Taylor, Jerry Weinberg, and Ed Yourdon for ideas and phrasings and nuances that made their way into the pages of <span class="italic">Slack</span>.</p><p class="calibre_13">—Tom DeMarco</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_5"></div>
