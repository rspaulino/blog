Let me now try to quantify their aggregate effect. In my experience, there is never less than a 15 percent penalty due to time-sharing a knowledge worker between two or more tasks. Moving a person who had been assigned to a single job to work part-time on a second exposes you to a loss of at least six hours per week of that person’s time. And the penalty is greater when the partitioning is greater. I limit this statement to knowledge workers, since manual and blue-collar workers may not be affected, or may be less affected, by some of the components of the task-switching penalty. For knowledge workers, though, the minimum penalty is 15 percent.</p><p class="calibre_12">The only method I have used so far to substantiate the 15 percent minimum penalty is a time-honored approach called <span class="italic">proof by repeated assertion</span>. Its conclusiveness rests on the fact that I have stated that there is a 15 percent minimum penalty and then stated it again (and again and again and again). Although widely used, proof by repeated assertion, you may argue, lacks a certain amount of satisfying rigor. To which I answer, “Compared to what?” Before I waded in, the presumption seemed to be that the task-switching penalty was essentially zero. We see this as companies everywhere assign knowledge workers in fragments, sometimes with as many as eight or ten different tasks allocated to a single person. The prevalence of this practice amounts to a frequently repeated assertion that there is <span class="italic">no penalty</span> or that it is so minor as to be ignorable.</p><p class="calibre_12">“Even without further” proof of which of these two assertions is more likely to be correct, 0 percent or 15 percent, I hope you would feel at least a little bit uncomfortable with the 0 percent premise. As it turns out, though, I have some evidence that is stronger than repeated assertion. Starting in 1984, my colleagues and I at the Atlantic Systems Guild began a three-year empirical study of software developers.<a id="filepos46007"></a><sup class="calibre6"><small class="calibre7"><a href="index_split_026.html#filepos48651"><span class="calibre8">1</span></a></small></sup> We enticed some six hundred programmers from more than a hundred organizations to test their skills against a benchmark of software development tasks. Participants worked in their own space, using their own facilities. They were also subjected to the normal run of interrupts, task switches, and ambient noise. We collected information about the environment and recorded each and every task switch. To no one’s surprise, people who were interrupted less often performed better. We modeled performance against task-switching frequency and came to the conclusion that the best way to understand task switching was to assume that each switch imposes a direct penalty of a bit more than twenty minutes of lost concentration. We also noted an average of nearly 0.4 switches per hour. This results in a direct loss of productive effort of more than one hour per day.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_25"></div>
