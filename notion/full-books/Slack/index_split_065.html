Whatever work is accomplished during the week is traditionally divided by the number of hours reported, not the number of hours really worked. Workers who have been assured that their managers are deeply cognizant of their overtime hours may be unaware that the productivity figures used to measure those same managers leave out the overtime hours entirely.</p><p class="calibre_12">This leads to an unfortunate management dynamic: Reported productivity can apparently be inflated by goading workers into working overtime; managers who extract more overtime from their workers look like more effective managers.</p><p class="calibre_12">I say this is an apparent inflation of productivity, because the worker is almost certainly less productive during all those extra hours. So we have an approach to productivity enhancement that <span class="italic">leads directly to productivity reduction</span>. This may not be immediately evident because the work produced by knowledge workers is not easy to measure. But suppose for a moment that it were …</p><p class="calibre_39"><span class="bold"> Gedankenexperiment in Productivity Measurement</span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_11">Imagine that you had a magical meter that could measure actual work performed by your knowledge workers, expressed in Total Useful Mental Discriminations. Suppose it shows that a given worker produces 800 TUMD over the course of an eight-hour day. Productivity is therefore 100 TUMD per hour.</p><p class="calibre_12">Now you somehow persuade that worker to stay an extra two hours. Your meter shows some drop-off in TUMD over the extra hours. The guy is tired and a bit distracted. He manages to achieve only 70 TUMD during hour nine and 30 TUMD during hour ten. Work accomplished during the full ten-hour day therefore total 900 TUMD. Real productivity for the day is reduced to 90 TUMD per hour (900 TUMD/10 hrs.). However, the <span class="italic">reported</span> productivity goes up:</p><p class="calibre_38">Reported Productivity = 900 TUMD/8 hrs. = 112.5 TUMD per hour</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_12">The fiction of basing productivity measurement on hours paid rather than hours worked leads directly to “productivity improvement” schemes that make people less productive.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_65"></div>
