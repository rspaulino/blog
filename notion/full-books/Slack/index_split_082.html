Corporate litigations are enormously expensive, typically costing the two parties a total in legal fees that dwarfs whatever settlement is finally imposed. Neither side wins, everybody loses. That is almost a defining characteristic of modern litigation: Everybody always loses. Nobody ever comes out ahead as a result of litigation. Legal fees are only part of the cost; the litigants may end up using as much or more manpower on the litigation as was expended on the entire contract under dispute. Litigations drag on forever, often longer than the term of the original contract. When the whole sad charade is over, morale of both organizations is depressed. All involved know they have just wasted years of their lives on something pointless and destructive.</p><p class="calibre_12">So why do they do it? Why enter into a litigation? When things go awry, why not just take your lumps and get on with the business of business? In my experience, there are two important reasons why litigation happens in spite of the most dismal prospects for it ever achieving anything worthwhile:</p><p class="calibre_21"><span class="bold">1.</span> Litigation can be an effective way to deflect blame. A failure that cannot be blamed on someone outside the organization must be accepted within the organization. And some highly political organizations exact a very high price for that.</p><p class="calibre_12"><span class="bold">2.</span> Litigation can be a consequence of an intrinsically flawed contract. The underlying agreement at the heart of the dispute leaves one party egregiously victimized by the other from the git-go. The redress that the aggrieved party seeks is more a matter of principle than profit.</p><p class="calibre_21">As you can see, these two causes don’t appear to have a lot in common. And, to add to the confusion, litigations of the first type are often obliged to masquerade as litigations of the second type. No matter which is the real cause, a Culture of Fear is sure to be involved.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_82"></div>
