MBO sends the message “Do everything the same as last year, only this year do more of X.” Setting increased X as the objective is a sign that management has determined that increments of X (assuming nothing else changes) will make their way into the bottom line.</p><p class="calibre_12">Continuing stasis is a consequence of the first flawed assumption at the heart of MBO: the ingenuous belief that success of the overall organization can be viewed as a simple arithmetic combination of lower-level objectives. The assumption is almost impossible to implement unless nearly everything is in steady state. Without a year or two of experience with current approaches, management has no way to scale the objectives. There is nothing to base a target on. Formulating the “simple arithmetic combination of lower-level objectives” is just too difficult without being able to use a stable model for guidance.</p><p class="calibre_12">But stasis plus just a bit of tinkering with the particulars is hardly a recipe for success in the new economy. Companies that are succeeding today have very little stasis. For example, the entire concept of “production” is going away. Production implies a steady state. In its place we find a state of almost constant flux. The new central organizing principal is the project. A company in this kind of flux can be viewed as a portfolio of projects. Each project seeks to effect some change.</p><p class="calibre_12">In an older, simpler time, projects were a way to move from one status quo to another. The project was a disruption, but the new status quo, once established, could be expected to last for an extended period. Now there is no new status quo.</p><p class="calibre_12">MBO depends on status quo. It assures merely incremental change. It guides you to make tactical adjustments only, always under the limitation that you mustn’t muck with the present strategy, whatever it may be. This is a sure path toward extinction.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_104"></div>
