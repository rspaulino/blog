Today I would tell you that Scott Adams, Dilbert’s creator, is one of my heroes. Adams gives insight and wisdom on nearly a daily basis and serves it up with a delightful twist of humor. What a marvelous body of work he has created!</p><p class="calibre_12">Adams is a hero, but Dilbert himself—the geeky guy with the pointed-up necktie—is no hero. Dilbert is a jerk. He keeps his head down, doesn’t object to even the most absurd of corporate absurdities, never makes waves, never puts his job on the line. It’s Dilbert and his ilk who make stupid management possible. If you’ve got people like that working for you, you start each management day at a disadvantage.</p><p class="calibre_12">It’s a rare company I visit these days that doesn’t have a Dilbert cartoon posted somewhere. I guess the message of these cartoons is “Our company is in some ways like Dilbert’s company, ” or, even worse, “My boss is in some ways like Dilbert’s boss.” When I encounter these cartoons, I always want to find the person who posted them and ask, “Yes, but are you like Dilbert?” Are you keeping your head down? Are you accepting senseless direction when it’s offered? Are you letting the bureaucracy dominate at the expense of the real goals? If so, I’d like to tell that person, then you’re part of the problem.</p><p class="calibre_12">At the risk of being a total killjoy, I propose that you look at the next Dilbert cartoon that falls under your eye in a totally different way. I propose that you ask yourself about Dilbert’s role in whatever corporate nonsense is the butt of the joke. Ask yourself, How should Dilbert have responded? (The real Dilbert, of course, never responds at all.) How could Dilbert have made this funny situation distinctly nonfunny? What could he have done to put an end to such absurdities? There is always an obvious answer. Sometimes the action is one that would get Dilbert fired.</p><p class="calibre_12">It’s easy (and fair) to blame lousy management on lousy managers. But it’s not enough. It’s also necessary to blame the people who allow themselves to be managed so badly. At least partly at fault for every bad management move is some gutless Dilbert who allows it to happen.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_116"></div>
