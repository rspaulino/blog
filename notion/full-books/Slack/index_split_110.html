The “ask not” statement is a call to action that depends for its force on an unspoken ending: Ask what you can do for your country <span class="italic">because this is what we are all about</span>. Without that unspoken ending, the challenge falls flat. The assertion at the heart of the quoted visionary statement is that the community lend-a-hand ethic is so deeply entrenched in this culture as to be positively definitional.</p><p class="calibre_12">The successful visionary statement will typically have the following characteristics:</p><p class="calibre_21"><span class="bold">1</span>. There has to be an element of <span class="italic">present</span> truth to the assertion. The challenge “Run a four-minute mile <span class="italic">because that’s what we are all about</span> ” would not inspire most of us because we wouldn’t see the present truth of the “what we’re all about” part.</p><p class="calibre_12"><span class="bold">2.</span> There is always an element of proposed <span class="italic">future</span> truth in the statement. Though it masquerades as “what we <span class="italic">are</span> all about, ” it is at least partly urging us toward “what we <span class="italic">could be</span> all about.”</p><p class="calibre_12"><span class="bold">3.</span> When the statement walks perfectly between what is and what could be, and the could-be part is wonderful but not impossible, acceptance by those listening is almost assured.</p><p class="calibre_21">People want to sign on. They want to be enrolled. Nobody listening to the president that day had the reaction “Oh damn, now I have to do stuff for my country.” On the contrary, they were delighted. The emergence of a leader is a source of satisfaction and completion for all. People want to be led toward a vision that is consistent with reality and their present assessment of the culture. When an organization is in drift and then suddenly everyone is aware that a hand has taken the helm, the sense of relief is palpable.</p><p class="calibre_12">The fact that people want to be led is what makes leadership possible at all.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_110"></div>
