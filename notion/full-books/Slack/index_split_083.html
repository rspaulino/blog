<p class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Litigation as a Means of Passing Blame</span></span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_11">Let’s say Buyer Corporation contracts with Seller Corporation for construction of a Somethingorother. Making Somethingorothers is the particular forte of Seller Corp., not Buyer Corp. That’s why the contract happened in the first place. But Buyer Corp. still has a role to play in successful completion of the contract: Buyer will almost certainly have to specify requirements for the Somethingorother to make sure it will receive exactly what it wants; it may have responsibility for acceptance-testing the delivered result consistent with the requirement. Buyer is also responsible for its selection of Seller. Finally, Buyer always has the responsibility to be sure that it really had a use for the Somethingorother, that it won’t turn out to be just another expensive fiasco.</p><p class="calibre_12">Suppose that Buyer Corp. fails in any one of its responsibilities. Failure doesn’t just happen, it’s somebody’s fault. Somebody was responsible for specifying the correct requirement, for example. If the requirement was imprecise, vague as to essential details, or just wrong, then that responsible party at Buyer is left holding the bag.</p><p class="calibre_12">In a healthy organization, a certain amount of failure is okay. At Microsoft, for example, there has long been an almost official policy of “sink, then swim.” People are loaded down with so much responsibility that they sink (fail). Then they have a chance to rest up, to analyze and modify their own performance. Finally, they are loaded again with a comparable amount of responsibility, but this time they succeed. If they don’t sink the first time, that just shows they weren’t challenged enough. They can be sure that the next time out they will be challenged a lot more aggressively. To the extent that this policy is applied company-wide, Microsoft seems to be run as an Outward Bound adventure. Finding your weaknesses by failing is not just incidental; it is designed into the corporate philosophy.</p><p class="calibre_12">Healthy companies know that they have to allow people to fail without assessing blame. They have to do that or else no one will take on anything that’s not a sure bet. Healthy companies know that, but Culture of Fear companies do not. In a Culture of Fear company, failure <span class="italic">must</span> be rewarded with punishment. (“What would we be, we sinful creatures, without fear?”) A typical punishment is that you get fired. If the people above you are insufficiently powerful, some of them may get fired as well. This creates a powerful incentive to pass responsibility for failure on by blaming someone outside the organization. When Seller, in my example, delivers exactly what Buyer Corp. asked for in its erroneous specification, the incentive is to sue Seller for delivering such a useless Somethingorother.</p><p class="calibre_12">You might think that such a suit would be doomed to fail, that Seller Corp. will trot out the erroneous specification, prove that the whole melancholy business was Buyer’s fault, and thus win the litigation. If you think that, you haven’t been paying attention. Nobody ever wins a litigation. Everybody always loses. To make matters worse, litigation is such a crapshoot that the relatively innocent party may end up losing worse than the relatively guilty party. This happens because today’s contracts are so technical and complex that our courts are overwhelmed by the issues. The results are more likely to be decided by quality of the legal team, or the relative comprehensibility of one side’s contention, than by the true merits of the case.</p><p class="calibre_12">When it’s all done, Buyer has suffered the failed project and then suffered further losses due to the litigation. But some people within Buyer Corp. may have successfully deflected blame from themselves to Seller. Even if the court disagrees, by the end of the infinitely long legal process, the guilty parties at Buyer have almost certainly been promoted out of the domain of responsibility or have left the company on their own schedule.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_83"></div>
