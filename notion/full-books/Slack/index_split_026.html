This has drastically increased fragmentation of workers. Such a restructuring tactic only makes sense if the task-switching penalty is smaller than the potential savings. In practice, it only makes sense if the penalty is essentially zero. But it never is.</p><p class="calibre_12">To the extent that a hidden task-switching penalty is now using up the resources of an overfragmented organization, the savings have been illusory. Fragmented knowledge workers may look busy, but a lot of their busyness is just thrashing, switching continually from one activity to another.</p><p class="calibre_12">To make matters worse, the decision about who should go and who should stay was usually based on proven performance. But work performance is not an abstraction: You can’t say that Ted is a high-performance worker in general, only that he has proved himself good at doing some one particular thing. Fragmentation will result in his doing less of that thing and more of something else, something he probably isn’t so good at. Even without the task-switching penalty, his performance is worsened.</p><p class="calibre_12">Knowledge workers aren’t fungible. Treating them as if they were will increase busyness but make it harder for them to get useful work done.</p><p class="calibre_21"><sup class="calibre6"><small id="filepos48651" class="calibre7"><a href="index_split_025.html#filepos46007"><span class="calibre9">1</span></a></small></sup>One of the study’s published reports was “Programmer Performance and the Effects of the Workplace,” <span class="italic">Proceedings of the 8<sup class="calibre6"><small class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9"><span class="italic">th</span></span></small></sup> International Conference on Software Engineerin</span> (London: IEEE Computer Society Press, 1985).</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_26"></div>
