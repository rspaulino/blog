<p class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Task-Switching Penalties</span></span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_11">The problem is that human workers are not entirely fungible. Even the most dedicated advocate of matrix management will understand that there are limits to how many ways an individual can be divided. They might think it okay for Lamar to have two assignments, for example, but begin to feel queasy about five. And ten or more are obviously too many.</p><p class="calibre_12">The reason ten are too many ways to split Lamar has to do with the cost he incurs in switching tasks. For example, if he’s working on each of his tasks at least part of each day, then he has to make at least nine switches per day. If each switch uses up ten minutes (to put away one set of drawings and take out the other, find the right instruments and media, locate the job description and the notes from the last meeting), then ninety minutes of Lamar’s day are lost to switching. Over an eight-hour day that works out to a nearly 20 percent penalty. That time is not spent productively on any one of his tasks; it is simply wasted.</p><p class="calibre_12">This ten-minute task-switching penalty is used up on the mechanics alone of the change: putting stuff away and taking other stuff out. But depending on what kind of work Lamar is doing, the switching penalty may be far more substantial than that. Suppose he’s not now in the drawing and layout phase of a project, but is conceptualizing. He is thinking out an ad campaign or concocting an interesting mix of images to convey a point. This rather mysterious activity is essential to his work, but not very well structured; Lamar himself probably couldn’t divide conceptualization into component pieces or impose an order on its subtasks. That means that if he has to stop in the middle, he won’t have a perfectly clean partitioning between work aborted today and restarted tomorrow. To get himself going tomorrow, he may have to go through some of the same mental steps that he’s just been through today. This rework is added to the mechanical components of the task-partitioning penalty.</p><p class="calibre_12">Even this may still be a too-optimistic model for what task switching really costs. There are certain kinds of work that require <span class="italic">immersion</span> into the task before progress can begin. In this category I include jobs like writing, research, analysis, invention, and programming. The immersion time is required to overcome a kind of mental inertia. Most of us are reluctant to begin on such a task unless we have a large block of time set aside.</p><p class="calibre_12">There may also be emotional inertia to overcome in some tasks. You can imagine a nurse, for example, pausing with her hand on the doorknob of a patient’s room, gathering her forces before a difficult procedure, or a salesperson building up confidence before a call.</p><p class="calibre_12">When highly immersive tasks are interrupted, a second immersion period is required to get going again. There may also be a frustration component if interruption is frequent. Workers who are frustrated have to use up some of their energy and time to calm themselves and face up to the potential for further frustration when they begin again.</p><p class="calibre_12">The waste associated with time-sharing between two tasks is the sum of time lost to the mechanics of the switch <span class="italic">plus</span> rework required upon restart <span class="italic">plus</span> immersion time <span class="italic">plus</span> frustration cost. You pay the penalty each time you switch.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_23"></div>
