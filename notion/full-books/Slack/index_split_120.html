<p class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Sine Qua Non of Change</span></span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_11">The single must-be-present ingredient of successful organizational change is safety. (Again, my catchphrase “successful organizational change” means proactive change, not reactive change.) Since people define themselves—in part at least—by what they do professionally, changing what they do gets deep into the matter of personal definition. This is scary stuff.</p><p class="calibre_12">Resistance to this kind of change can be fierce. It can also be hidden, angry, vituperative, and destructive. Against all this, managerial coercion is simply no match. You can’t <span class="italic">make</span> proactive change happen; the best you can do is <span class="italic">help</span> it to happen. In place of coercion, your only workable tool is urging.</p><p class="calibre_12">Change always implies abandonment. What you’re abandoning is an old way of doing things. You’re abandoning it <span class="italic">because</span> it’s old, because time has made it no longer the best way. But it is also (again because it’s old) a familiar way. And more important, it is an approach that people have mastered. So the change you are urging upon your people requires them to abandon their mastery of the familiar, and to become novices once again, to become rank beginners at something with self-definitional importance.</p><p class="calibre_12">People can make this kind of change, but they can only make it if they feel safe. In an unsafe environment, people are not likely to let themselves be thrust into a position of inexperience. They will resist the change, and all your urging won’t shake them from their determination to have no part of it.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_120"></div>
