<p class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">The Busy Worker</span></span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_11">Extreme busyness is injurious to the real work of the organization. I will make that point as carefully as I can in the chapters to follow, stressing the effect in particular on management. But first, I ask you to consider how busyness may hurt the effectiveness of even the lowest-level workers.</p><p class="calibre_12">Take, for example, the secretary. (You remember secretaries, don’t you? A once-common element of corporate life.) A secretary’s job may involve document preparation, appointment scheduling, coordinating, and generally facilitating the smooth functioning of one manager’s work life—let’s say yours. We’ll call her Sylvia.</p><p class="calibre_12">A good secretary is a treasure, as anyone who has ever worked with one knows, and Sylvia is definitely a treasure. With Sylvia around, everything goes more smoothly. When you’re away from the office—it never looks this way officially, but whom are we kidding?—Sylvia is effectively in charge. She is the one who coordinates and distributes work to be done. If she ever left, it would set you and your organization back a few months, at least.</p><p class="calibre_12">But now into this happy scenario drop a consultant with a charter to reduce cost, the “corporate restructuring agent.” Whoa, he says, what’s this? A secretary? And what’s she up to this very minute? He parks himself beside Sylvia’s desk with his trusty stopwatch in hand. To no one’s surprise, he finds that Sylvia is really only busy 43 percent of the time. The rest of the time she is … available. She’s available to do stuff that you or your people find you need to have done. That’s part of what’s so great about Sylvia: When something comes up, she can usually get cracking on it right away.</p><p class="calibre_12">A look of triumph now comes over the consultant’s face. If Sylvia is only busy 43 percent of the time, 57 percent of her cost is potentially savable. Why, all we have to do is dump Sylvia into a “pool” and allocate 43 percent of her time to you and the rest to other people. Or have you share her with some other manager who needs only 57 percent of a full person. Or even get rid of Sylvia entirely and hire a temp for that 43 percent of the time that you really need someone. (You can be sure that the consultant will be checking back later to find out if you <span class="italic">really</span> need that much help.)</p><p class="calibre_12">What an improvement. Sylvia’s gone or gone 57 percent of the time, and 57 percent of what she was costing the organization goes directly down to the bottom line. Wow. In place of a person who was idle 57 percent of the time, we now have someone who is busy 100 percent of the time. Talk about efficiency!</p><p class="calibre_12">The problem, of course, is that the now-slackless secretary or portion thereof is simply not as responsive as Sylvia was. This highly efficient person doesn’t get cracking right away on anything new that comes up, because this highly efficient person is too busy.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_18"></div>
