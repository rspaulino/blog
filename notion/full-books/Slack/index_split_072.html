On a political level, the First Law explains the conduct of America’s war on drugs, among other things. (Maybe it explains <span class="italic">everything</span> that happens in politics.)</p><p class="calibre_12">In corporations, First Law abuse is a direct result of trying to manage without benefit of talent. Talented managers are largely immune to this stuff; they’re all sense organ, constantly attuned to the effect their leadership is having on their people, constantly adjusting and refining their focus for maximum effect. If something isn’t working, they stop doing it and try something else. Managers without such talent find themselves relying on formulas and “principles” of management. They reason, “This thing I’m trying to do <span class="italic">should</span> work; the fact that it isn’t working probably suggests that I’m doing it halfheartedly.” And so they do more of whatever they’ve been doing.</p><p class="calibre_12">While the First Law is amusing and certainly explains some of the worst organizational fiascoes, it is intrinsically pathological. Thus, it doesn’t provide useful guidance to basically capable managers who are striving to become better. My consulting work puts me in constant contact with such good people. I see them succeed and I sometimes see them fail. I try to help them capitalize on their strengths and combat their weaknesses. My purpose in this chapter is to offer a concise observation to help these good managers avoid one of the dumbest and yet most common and damaging errors of management.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_72"></div>
