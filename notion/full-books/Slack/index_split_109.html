Without vision, a company can react, but it can’t pro-act. It can lay off workers or close plants or retrench. Those are changes, in a sense, but they aren’t Change; they don’t deliver the much-vaunted benefit we’re supposed to get from whatever flexibility we manage to build into the organization.</p><p class="calibre_12">Without vision, flexibility is just an abstraction. It is a measure of what we could do if we ever got the gumption to try it (but we haven’t and we won’t).</p><p class="calibre_12">Successful change can only come in the context of a clear understanding of what may never change, what the organization stands for. This is what Peter Drucker calls the organization’s <span class="italic">culture</span>. Culture, as he uses the term, is that which cannot, will not, and must not change. We talk a lot about changing corporate culture, as though it were just another parameter of the organization, like an SIC code or address. But Drucker would have us look at culture entirely differently, as the bedrock upon which any constructive change will have to rest.</p><p class="calibre_12">If nothing is declared unchangeable, then the organization will resist <span class="italic">all</span> change. When there is no defining vision, the only way the organization can define itself is its stasis. Like the human creature that fights wildly to resist changing whatever it considers its identity, the corporate organism without vision will hold on to stasis as its only meaningful definition of self.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_109"></div>
