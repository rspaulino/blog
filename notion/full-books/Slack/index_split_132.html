The answer is, during time that is not used up directing the day-to-day business. The fact that managers have time on their hands (i.e., their operations tasks use up less than eight hours per day) gives them time for reinvention. The extra time is not waste but slack. Without it they could function in only their operational roles. Reinvention would be impossible because the people who could make it happen are just too busy to take the time.</p><p class="calibre_12">Even companies that didn’t fire their change centers have hurt themselves by encouraging their middle managers to stay extremely busy. In order to enable change, companies have to learn that keeping managers busy is a blunder. If you have busy managers working under you, they are an indictment of your vision and your capacity to transform that vision into reality. Cut them some slack.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_132"></div>
