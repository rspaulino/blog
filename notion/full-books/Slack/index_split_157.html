If so, you do have all your eggs in one basket: that project. You understand that the role allocated to you is to succeed at that project because <span class="italic">the company is counting on it!</span> The bad news is that risk management does not give you a way to force the success of that project, only to maximize the odds of its success. If enough of the project’s component risks actually materialize, the entire effort may fail—that is, it may fail to complete on time, it may overspend its budget, it may not be able to deliver enough value by the deadline.</p><p class="calibre_12">The control that risk management gives you is stochastic, not deterministic. You have <span class="italic">deterministic</span> control, for example, over the pressure of a given weight of gas in a vat; how you set the temperature and alter the volume will determine the pressure absolutely. As long as you get to set these parameters, you are totally in control. You have <span class="italic">stochastic</span> control over the rate at which employees leave your company to take jobs with the competition. Variables like salary and benefits and work hours and pressure have a tendency to affect the leave-rate, but no matter how correctly you set them, there is no guarantee that Harold will stick it out till the project ends.</p><p class="calibre_12">Stochastic control may be fine for the company, but not so good for an individual manager who comes up a winner or a loser based on a single undertaking. But it’s important to realize that <span class="italic">it is good for the company</span>. Furthermore, some projects are large enough to be considered complete portfolios of risks, and it may be possible to use stochastic control within the project to achieve overall success.</p><p class="calibre_12">Added to the bad news of no deterministic control is more bad news that the tools of risk management are more than a little counterintuitive. Since they deal with uncertainty, they are of necessity probabilistic in nature, hence not so easy to grasp. Finally, a last bit of bad news: A risk management approach is distinctly at odds with an article of corporate theology called Can Do Management. (More about Can Do at the end of this chapter.)</p><p class="calibre_12">I’ve presented the negatives of risk management up front. All the rest is good news. But the negatives make quite a devastating package: nondeterministic control, counterintuitive tools, and misfit with an important part of corporate culture. Why on earth would you want to do such a thing?</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_157"></div>
