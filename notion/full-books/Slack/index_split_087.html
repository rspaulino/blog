Consider: Your new Lucent telephone uses the exact same modular connector (RJ-11 in the United States) to plug into the line jack as your older Panasonic phone used. It has the same ten number keys and two special-character keys as your old phone, and they are arrayed in the same 3 X 4 layout. It sends the same multifrequency tones, works on the same signal and ringing voltages, respects the same tip-and-ring wiring convention. If it draws house current, it does so through a standard plug that will fit into your standard wall receptacle. If it didn’t respect all these standard conventions, the new phone would be useless; your only option for installing it at all would be to connect to an entire telephone infrastructure supplied by the same maker. Changing anything would force you to change everything.</p><p class="calibre_12">Widespread and widely respected standards assure that you can drop a Fuji film canister into a Kodak camera and the ensemble will work every bit as well as if you dropped it in a Kodak canister. You can buy floppy disks and tape cassettes and pencil lead and batteries and staples and gasoline and copy paper from any of a host of different providers and never worry about fit. Standards are not just good; they are <span class="italic">essential</span> to our modern way of life.</p><p class="calibre_12">Which brings us to the subject of process standards. If standards in everything else are good, why not a standard way to develop an ad campaign, or a standard way to review employee performance, or a standard way to write computer programs, or a standard way to do any of the myriad tasks that make up the modern world of knowledge work? What could be more sensible than adopting one way of doing any particular task and then imposing that way on all employees? The advantage is obvious: We’ll be able to switch people from one part of the organization to another and the work procedures will be so familiar that adaptation is easy. (We might even switch them around several times a day!)</p><p class="calibre_12">There is enough perceived value in this proposition, and enough precedent for it all around us, that our every inclination may be to accept the validity of standard process and set out to standardize everything we do. This can lead to a positive obsession with process. Process obsession is the problem. Process obsession is not just an anomaly that occurs now and again. It is an epidemic. Process obsession is as common in knowledge-worker organizations today as the common cold … and, in my opinion, about as desirable.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_87"></div>
