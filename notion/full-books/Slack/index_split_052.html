Could it be that in the commitment stage of project work something comes over us the way the evil Mr. Hyde could take over kindly Dr. Jekyll? We take an already risky endeavor and complicate it further by making or signing on to commitments that are at or beyond the hairy edge of possibility.</p><p class="calibre_12">Managers during the commitment process can be like little boys posturing before a schoolyard fight: “I’m gonna knock your block off.” “I’m gonna wipe up the floor with you.” “I’m gonna hit you so hard your teeth will rattle.” This posturing is inconsistent with the desultory performance of the fight that follows (if there even is one), and even further removed from the demonstrated performance of fights past. So, too, the over-committing manager. He/she promises a level of performance not achieved in the past and not likely to be achieved in the future.</p><p class="calibre_12">Overcommitment is not just an accident. Companies sometimes take purposeful steps to build an overcommitment ethic into their managers and into the corporate culture. I recently visited an off-site training experience where a hundred or so professional project managers were subjected to one whole evening of Formula One race videos, complete with the requisite number of clips showing horrible crashes and near-death experiences. Formula One is a sport in which participants risk their lives to push the envelope of performance by tiny increments. There is no prize for finishing second. What message was the company sending by showing its managers these videos? The clear implication was that it wanted its managers to go for broke. Small wonder, then, that so many of the projects they manage do in fact end up broke.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_52"></div>
