<p class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Why Achieving Both Is Not Easy</span></span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_11">Let’s face it, the implicit goal in all organizations is to be both: to make effective choices about what to do and then carry those choices out efficiently. That presumption is so strongly built into organizational cultures everywhere that their executives sometimes can’t see when it isn’t happening. It’s absolutely supposed to be happening, so it must be. The fact that the organization <span class="italic">is</span> moving in a given direction is strong a priori evidence that that must be the <span class="italic">right</span> direction. They are annoyed when anyone in the organization challenges direction. “We wouldn’t be doing this stuff at all if it weren’t right; now what we need is for everyone to get on board to help us do it as efficiently as possible.”</p><p class="calibre_12">Unfortunately, momentum in some direction or other does not necessarily imply carefully thought-out strategic thinking. A company can begin to move (or be moved) by a process that is more or less <span class="italic">drift</span>. The Brownian motion within the company asserts a net force in some direction and “By God we’re moving.” The difference between strategic thinking and drift is a matter of whether the key choices are made mindfully or mindlessly.</p><p class="calibre_12">It may sound like a harsh charge that organizations are setting directions mindlessly, that they’re prone to get their tactics right but not their strategy. But tactics are a lot easier than strategy. Tactics can be handled in isolation. You as head of a single department in your company can optimize that department to make it more efficient in what it does, but you can’t unilaterally redirect it to do something different. That change would have to be effected above you, where the issues are an order of magnitude more complex. And it would have to be done in such a way as to build wide consensus among disparate interest groups. This requires both powerful vision and charismatic leadership. The idea that drift is often substituted for strategic direction-setting is no more surprising than the observation that visionary, charismatic leaders are few and far between.</p><p class="calibre_12">All this suggests that a lot of companies are not really led at all. If that’s true, why isn’t it more apparent? Why don’t they seem leaderless? That is the direct result of what I call the Easy Executive Option.</p><p class="calibre_38">Directing an entire organization is hard. <span class="italic">Seeming</span> to direct it, on the other hand, is easy. All you have to do is note which way the drift is moving and instruct the organization to go that way.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_12">It was the Easy Executive Option at work, for example, that caused General Motors to cede the small-vehicle sector to foreign competition or to lag behind during the eighties and nineties in energy-efficient engines and nontraditional fuels.</p><p class="calibre_12">In addition to being flat-out hard to do, building effectiveness into an organization often comes into direct conflict with increasing efficiency. This is an unfortunate side effect of optimization, first noted by the geneticist R. A. Fisher, and now referred to as Fisher’s fundamental theorem: “The more highly adapted an organism becomes, the less adaptable it is to any new change.” Fisher’s example was the giraffe. It is highly adapted to food found up among the tree branches, but so unadaptable to a new situation that it can not even pick up a peanut from the ground at the zoo.</p><p class="calibre_12">The more optimized an organism (organization) is, the more likely that the slack necessary to help it become more effective has been eliminated.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_100"></div>
