Burned-out workers have no heart for anything—not for more overtime, not even for putting in a sensible eight hours a day. They are simply lost to the effort. If they have any capacity left at all, they will use it to conceal the burnout, or at least to try to do so. But they won’t be able to do any real work. In my reviews of overstressed projects, I am constantly amazed at the presence of so many zombies on the staff, people who go through the paces but no longer contribute. And they are often the ex-stars of the enterprise.</p><p class="calibre_12">Burned-out workers usually leave and thus fall into the turnover category, discussed below. But not always. Sometimes they stay on as zombies. Organizations with a lot of burnout begin to have a weighty, lethargic feel, just what you’d expect of a staff made up largely of the living dead.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_60"></div>
