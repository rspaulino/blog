We sought out a pair of overstuffed chairs and gave ourselves the luxury of an hour to catch up on each other’s recent doings and to shoot the breeze. Capers is the founder of a now-prestigious company that specializes in scheduling and estimation of complex development projects. The company makes a sophisticated line of parametric analysis tools. Capers pulled out a laptop and, right there in the hotel lobby, gave me a spiffy demo of the most recent version. The tool asks you a series of questions about your project and then proposes likely schedules, manpower loading patterns, interim deliverables, and the like. In the query stage, the package asks for guidance about what to optimize. You are presented with a pair of radio buttons:</p><blockquote class="calibre_30"><img src="images/00044.jpg" class="calibre_23"/> Minimize time</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_40"><img src="images/00044.jpg" class="calibre_23"/> Minimize cost</blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_11">You have to pick one or the other.</p><p class="calibre_12">“My clients give me a lot of grief about this choice,” Capers told me. “They tell me that what they really want to do is minimize <span class="italic">both</span> time and cost.”</p><p class="calibre_12">Capers patiently explains to them the impossibility of minimizing both of two mutually dependent variables. You can minimize some weighted combination of the two, he tells them, but it doesn’t make sense to … By this time, their eyes would be glazing over.</p><p class="calibre_12">“I’m half tempted,” he told me, “to put in a third radio button for ‘Minimize <span class="italic">both</span> time and cost.’ It’s a logical absurdity, of course, but they seem to need it. Then the tool would have to make some reasonable assumption about the relative weighting of the two.”</p><p class="calibre_12">The need for that third radio button tells us something more than a little bit sad about modern-day management: Managers in all parts of our economy are under enormous pressure to do everything much faster and much more cheaply, to minimize <span class="italic">both</span> time and cost. Logically absurd or not, that is the charter given to them, and they’ve got to work with it.</p><p class="calibre_12">When you’re torn between two mutually exclusive goals, when there is no room for give in either one, the result is stress. Managers everywhere are under stress, and stress, as we all know, is bad for the health, tough on relationships, and causes poor judgment. That’s the effect of stress on the individual. What’s less well appreciated is the effect of stress on organizations. In the following chapters, I examine some of the symptoms and behaviors of overstressed organizations. Among those symptoms and behaviors are declining health, failing relationships (with customers and employees), and a lot of lousy judgment.</p><p class="calibre_12">When stress is the problem, slack is the solution. From this perspective, organizational stress looks like nothing more than a sign of deficient slack. For want of needed slack, organizations become frenzied, fearful, and risk averse, and their key employees wander away, looking for someplace more sensible to work.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_45"></div>
