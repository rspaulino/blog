Going faster increased risk (more sail kept aloft in high winds, more chances taken in unknown and shoal waters, more fatigue and more human error). In such a time, the naval forces would instruct their captains to “proceed with all prudent speed” to arrive in a timely manner at an engagement. Prudent speed is something other than breakneck speed. It’s slower. We have to learn to move our knowledge endeavors “at all prudent speed.”</p><p class="calibre_12">The key to this is to look at entire risk diagrams, not just the rosy-scenario point where they intersect the axis. If a given strategy moves the weight of your risk diagram markedly to the left, then it is a good strategy. Do whatever it tells you to do. If the risk subsequently doesn’t materialize, you will have spent some extra time along the way that turned out not to be necessary. Put that in the same category as the money you spent last year on life insurance that turned out not to be needed.</p><p class="calibre_12">The difference between the time it takes you to arrive at “all prudent speed ” and time it would take you at “breakneck speed” is your slack. Slack is what helps you arrive quickly but with an unbroken neck.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_168"></div>
