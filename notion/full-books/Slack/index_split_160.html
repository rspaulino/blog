It sounds like lying. But being a Can Do manager sounds good. We’re all expected to have a certain Can Do attitude. Admit it: You feel a little thrill of approval when the big boss calls for extraordinary performance and his/her subordinates respond, “Can do.” This is the throwing-down and the accepting of a challenge. And accepting challenge is neat. You tell yourself, “Nobody would ever do anything ambitious if they didn’t commit to it, no matter how undoable it sounds at the beginning.” Can Do thinking is a fixture in most modern companies.</p><p class="calibre_12">Can Do is, unfortunately, antithetical to risk management. Risk management has to acknowledge directly the Can’t Do possibilities. There is no way to be a complete Can Do manager and also practice risk management.</p><p class="calibre_12">You can’t do both yourself, but there is no reason why your company couldn’t. The individual manager has to be Can Do or Can’t Do in attitude; the two don’t mix. The company, on the other hand, could have a mix of complete Can Do managers and a few Can’t Do’s. The charter for most of you would be to psych yourselves up for success. “But,” the boss would explain at the beginning, “Lillian is our Can’t Do specialist, our risk manager. It’s her job to focus on the uglies, all the could-go-wrongs that might interfere with our plans. All the rest of you succeed if you achieve your most ambitious goals. And Lillian succeeds if she warns me of every possible eventuality that might reasonably be expected to thwart us. She fails if I get blindsided by anything she hasn’t warned me about.”</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_160"></div>
