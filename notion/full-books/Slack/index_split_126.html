One other person who had decided to wait was a mother with her two little girls, a few rows ahead of me. Since I had only one shoulder bag on that flight, I paused beside her and asked if I could help with some of her gear (it’s always amazing to me how much stuff mothers need to carry with them). “I’ve got an arm free,” I said. “Could I carry something for you?”</p><p class="calibre_12">“You sure could, ” the woman answered. And she plunked an angelic little blond-haired girl into my arm. I went off the flight as high as a kite. The mother had brought along a two-kid stroller, which she unfolded just inside the terminal. I put the little girl into her side of the stroller and said good-bye. The entire incident took up three minutes of my life and it was nineteen years ago. But I haven’t forgotten it and I never will.</p><p class="calibre_12">The giving of trust is an enormously powerful gesture. The recipient gives back loyalty as an almost autonomous response. Gifted leaders know in their bones how to entrust. It is something they do on a daily basis. They give responsibility well before it’s been completely earned. They know when to turn their backs and take their chances.</p><p class="calibre_12">As a young engineer, I was privileged to work under a succession of great managers at Bell Telephone Laboratories, Computer Applications, La CEGOS Informatique, and Swedish Philips. Beside each of those managers’ names I could write down a specific act of undeserved trust, a responsibility they assigned to me just slightly before the rest of the world (even I myself) would have been ready to acknowledge I had earned it. Even today I feel emotional about some of those assignments. At the time, I was proud and delighted, and also scared stiff. Most of all I was determined that the person who had so trusted me would not ever regret it.</p><p class="calibre_12">I’ve written about the giving of trust as though it were a simple formula for building loyalty. But it isn’t simple at all. The talent that is an essential ingredient of leadership tells the leader whom to trust and how much to trust and when to trust. The rule is (as with children) that trust be given slightly in advance of demonstrated trustworthiness. But not too much in advance. You have to have an unerring sense of how much the person is ready for. Setting people up for failure doesn’t make them loyal to you; you have to set them up for success.</p><p class="calibre_12">Each time you give trust in advance of demonstrated performance, you flirt with danger. If you’re risk-averse, you won’t do it. And that’s a shame, because the most effective way to gain the trust and loyalty of those beneath you is to give the same in equal measure.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_126"></div>
