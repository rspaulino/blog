Managers who think of pushing the lever as a major part of what management is all about are missing most of what management is all about. Yet it is not entirely their fault. They were drawn into management because they wanted to do something more gratifying than apply endless pressure on the poor souls lower down the hierarchy.</p><p class="calibre_12">It’s the stressed-out organization that elevates the use of pressure to its prominent status. It makes its managers apply far too much. The long-term effect of too much pressure is demotivation, burnout, and loss of key people. The best managers use pressure only rarely and never over extended periods.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_50"></div>
