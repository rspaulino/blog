All of this spells out opportunity, and opportunity implies risk. Nobody is going to succeed without taking chances and we all know it. Risk-taking has come to be recognized as a modern necessity. Even the most staid of today’s corporations know that risk is something they dare not run away from.</p><p class="calibre_12">An appealing definition of success in such an environment is this: <span class="italic">Take lots of risks and overcome each and every one of them</span>. When the specifics of all these little triumphs are entered into the official plan, the result is an approach called Plan for Success. Plan for Success is a staple of management philosophy, particularly in our high-tech industries. It leads us to pour desired outcomes into concrete, and make commitments based on achieving those outcomes.</p><p class="calibre_12">Plan for Success is the intellectual equivalent of: Make big bucks by winning fifteen consecutive hands of blackjack without taking any money off the table till the end. It works when it works, but leaves you in the lurch when it doesn’t (which is most of the time). It also puts an effective damper on risk-taking. An organization that is expected to overcome <span class="italic">all</span> adversity can’t afford to take on any but the most trivial risks. Conversely, an organization that has suffered no important setbacks has in fact taken no real risks.</p><p class="calibre_12">Risk management is almost the opposite of Plan for Success. Risk management is—take a deep gulp of air here, this is going to be unsettling—a discipline of <span class="italic">planning for failure</span>. Companies that practice risk management make explicit provision for lots of small (but expensive) failures along the way to overall success. Overall success means taking a lot of money off the table at the end.</p><p class="calibre_12">Taking a risk means exposing yourself to additional cost or delay. If you take lots of risks, some will end up costing you and others won’t. You may catch a break on the whole: Say only one in ten of the bad stuff that might have happened actually does happen and actually costs you extra time or money. But you can’t count on dodging all risk consequences. You need to set aside some slack of time and money to accommodate a likely break on risks that materialize as opposed to those that evaporate. The science of risk management guides you as to how much slack to provide.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_155"></div>
