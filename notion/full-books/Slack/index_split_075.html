<p class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Flight from Challenge</span></span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_11">We don’t do this dumb Second Law thing only because we forget how essential management really is. There are other, much graver causes. The first of these is safety. In a sufficiently overstressed organization, it is positively <span class="italic">unsafe</span> to manage. Only the work itself—the lowest-level work, such as making product—keeps you safe. So if you manage at all, that has to be a parttime task. The rest of the time you are making product, bringing in revenue. Bringing in revenue makes you safe; the time you spend managing therefore won’t count too heavily against you … <span class="italic">provided</span> you keep it to a minimum. This is hardly a formula for thoughtful management.</p><p class="calibre_12">We also assign ourselves to lower-level work because we’re fleeing from challenge. Yes, I know, we all love a good challenge, but that doesn’t mean we don’t sometimes get cold feet and look for a way out. The challenges of management are daunting: They lead us into the scarily intangible world of people relations, motivation, societal formation, conflict, and conflict resolution.</p><p class="calibre_12">In my own case, I was promoted into a management position, fresh from a technological job where there were <span class="italic">no</span> intangibles. I had been a real-time system designer just before my promotion. Systems design is deliciously black-and-white: Your design works or it doesn’t. It is sufficiently flexible and accommodating to change or it isn’t. You may not know this perfectly at design time, but the implementation phase, which comes next, will quickly prove your design acceptable (even elegant) or not. There are few nuances.</p><p class="calibre_12">But management is all nuance. Why on earth is Maria so irritable? What’s the tension between Armand and Elwood? Is Danny looking for a new job, and what will we do if he leaves? Have I sold the due date as difficult but doable, or is everybody giggling at my naïveté? Did I hit the right tone in my briefing? Is my boss suddenly out of favor, and what does that mean to me?</p><p class="calibre_12">While I was still coming to grips with all this, one of my designers upped and quit. I unhesitatingly covered the job myself. Whew, what a relief. Now I was not only a manager, but able to spend my days doing sublimely black-and-white work. It seemed like the best of all worlds. But it wasn’t. I was walking away from the challenge of management to return to work I knew cold. The relief it gave me was the relief of retreat.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_75"></div>
