Middle-level managers need to work <span class="italic">together</span> to conceive of and make any meaningful change happen. And middle managers almost never work together. In fact, managers at all levels tend to work in relative isolation.</p><p class="calibre_12">Even first-time managers, brand-new at the task, might find themselves sitting alone in a closed office, wondering how their peers would deal with some of the problems they’ve just been handed. You might think they’d buttonhole some older manager and say, “Hey, however did you deal with [whatever]?”</p><p class="calibre_12">That certainly would be sensible, but it’s not so easy. The comfortable, shared involvement and collaboration that is common among nonmanagerial knowledge workers is less common among managers. In its place is an uneasy tension, a sense of competitiveness. That competitive tension is particularly evident when middle managers don’t feel safe. They are all thinking that if somebody has to go, let it be one of the others. This is hardly an attitude to foster collaboration.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_133"></div>
