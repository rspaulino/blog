<p class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">How Much Is Human Capital Worth?</span></span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_11">It’s worth going through the exercise to quantify the human capital represented by the people who work for you. Think of an average performer in your group. I’m going to call him Orin. We could assess the value of Orin’s domain knowledge by following him around over the years as he acquired it and charging the learning part of his salary and overhead to capital (the rest would be treated as expense).</p><p class="calibre_12">Rather than go through this laborious exercise, let’s approximate with a trick: Assume that Orin is about to leave. He waltzes in one day and informs you that he will be gone at the end of the month. His job doesn’t go away, so you scurry about to hire a replacement. Let’s say the replacement’s name is Oliver. Oliver arrives the day after Orin departs. I think you will agree that Oliver is essentially useless on his first day, since most of what he’s doing is getting his bearings (this, too, is part of the acquisition of domain knowledge). He’s even worse than useless, as he is using up other people’s time to get him jumpstarted.</p><p class="calibre_12">On some day in the future, you will conclude that Oliver has learned enough to be essentially as useful as Orin was. How long this takes is a function of how unique your domain is, and how different it is from the last place that Oliver worked. If you’re the pension accounting group of a plain-vanilla insurance company, and your Oliver last worked for one of your competitors doing almost the exact same work in the same context, then he will probably be completely up to speed in a month. If you’re a telecommunications company that makes specialty packet sniffers, like one of my clients, and Oliver has only a general background in communications protocols, he may take as much as two years to be able to carry as much weight as Orin was carrying before he left. Write down your best guess of how long it will take Oliver to become the total equivalent of Orin. Express the result in months. My approximation for the value of the investment in Oliver is:</p><p class="calibre_38">Human Capital = Time to get up to speed × (Salary + Overhead) × 50%</p><p class="calibre_12">Oliver is 0 percent useful on the first day of this period and 100 percent useful on the last day, so I have made a simple straight-line assumption about his improving usefulness over the period. Thus, if it takes him six months to get up to speed, then your investment in his domain knowledge is 50 percent of that, or three times his total monthly cost.</p><p class="calibre_12">Viewed another way, when Orin left, your capital loss was, similarly, three person-months.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_40"></div>
