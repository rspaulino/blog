As soon as it’s apparent that this new approach is superior to what they have been doing for years, there is an unspoken “Oh shit” that ripples through the room. Their faces turn white. You can practically hear the flip-flops in their stomachs.</p><p class="calibre_12">At such a moment, it helps the learner to be able to glance over at someone else whose face is also white, who’s also got a little perspiration showing on the upper lip. The presence of the co-learner, the patient urging of the facilitator, and a lot of easy, unthreatening reinforcing material are necessary to help get people past this professional’s learning block. Without all these elements in place, many or all of the potential learners will dismiss the troubling new idea as “preposterous.”</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_139"></div>
