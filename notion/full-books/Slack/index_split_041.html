<p class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Aggregate Human Capital and Capital Drain</span></span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_11">Assume for a moment that all your people have a human capital invested in them similar to Orin’s. Multiply the capital writedown for the loss of an Orin by number of Orins. This is your aggregate human capital. Example:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><table border="0" valign="top" class="calibre_18"><tr valign="top" class="calibre_19"><td class="calibre_20"><span class="bold">Knowledge-worker staff </span></td><td class="calibre_20"><span class="bold">30 people </span></td></tr><tr valign="top" class="calibre_19"><td class="calibre_20"><span class="bold">Average ramp-up time </span></td><td class="calibre_20"><span class="bold">6 months </span></td></tr><tr valign="top" class="calibre_19"><td class="calibre_20"><span class="bold">Average cost per person-month (plus overhead) </span></td><td class="calibre_20"><span class="bold">$7,500 </span></td></tr><tr valign="top" class="calibre_19"><td class="calibre_20"><span class="bold">Aggregate human capital </span></td><td class="calibre_20"><span class="bold">(30 × 6 × $7,500 × 50%) $675,000 </span></td></tr></table><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_12">Similarly, you could calculate the rate at which this capital asset is draining out of your organization due to the loss of people. Multiply the frequency of personnel turnover that you’ve been experiencing recently by the human capital of one person.</p><blockquote class="calibre_30">Human Capital Drain = <span class="calibre2">LOSSO<sub class="calibre10"><small class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">Orin</span></small></sub></span> × % staff turnover per month</blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_12">For a turnover of 24 percent (2 percent per month), the drain is $13,500 per month. If it takes a full year rather than half a year to bring an Orin up to speed, then the drain due to turnover is twice as high, or $27,000 per month. This comes to 12 percent of your entire manpower budget (30 × $7,500). Twelve percent of your entire productive capacity is burned up replacing lost human capital. None of that effort is available to do any useful work. As you can see, ongoing human capital drain can be a substantial burden on your ability to get work done.</p><p class="calibre_12">The analysis so far is of an organization in relative stasis. If things are changing, the human capital loss is worse. Whenever you act to change an organization, the cost of the change ends up as increased human capital in the heads of the people who implement the change. During the change, each person who drifts away costs you as much as double what such a loss would be in the steady state.</p><p class="calibre_12">Before getting to the relationship between slack and turnover, I need to mention the special case of organizations doing project work. On projects, the turnover calculus works somewhat differently. First of all, the extent of required domain knowledge is larger, since there are two important domains to master: the business area being impacted by the project, and the project itself (its technology, for example). Further, since projects have a finite end in the not-too-distant future, untimely loss of project personnel can be still more injurious to the effort: The entire human capital replacement cost of someone who quits has to be borne by the project even though the ramp-up time may extend out beyond the project end. It might make perfect sense from the viewpoint of the organization as a whole to replace an Orin when he leaves near the end of your project, but it might not make sense from the project’s point of view. You as project manager may realize that you could finish earlier by limping along to the end with no one in Orin’s place. The burden of bringing an Oliver up to speed may not be paid back in the short period between his arrival and project end.</p><p class="calibre_12">All of this explains why the loss of even nonstar performers can be a serious burden on effectiveness. Companies within a single industry often have variations of turnover rate of as much as three or four times. Those with the higher turnovers are laboring under a huge penalty. But what can they do about it?</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_41"></div>
