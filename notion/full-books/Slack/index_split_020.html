I have argued that the potential to do harm in this endeavor is substantial. In other words, improving efficiency may in many cases be countereffective. But that is not to imply that improving efficiency is therefore easy. It isn’t. In fact, it takes a huge amount of work and real ingenuity. It’s hard to make an organization more efficient because the workers of that organization have been constantly trying to make themselves more efficient. They’ve been doing that for years, since they are frustrated by waste and bored by idleness. The efficiency expert who now comes into the organization is obliged to plow over terrain that has been plowed over by many thoughtful persons before. Up against this daunting challenge, who can blame him if he takes the odd shortcut from time to time to show a little apparent progress?</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_20"></div>
