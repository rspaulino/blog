The efficiency-optimized organization recognizes quality as its enemy. That’s why many corporate Quality Programs are really Quality Reduction Programs in disguise.</p><p class="calibre_12">A common way to make yourself more efficient at the expense of quality is to shift some of your cost to your customer. I think of this as “taking it out of the customer’s hide.” You see it in airlines when they reduce the cost of meals essentially to zero (you then have to pick up dinner on your own tab), or in hotels where cost reduction leads to ever smaller rooms for the same price. Since so much of the cost of today’s business is labor, the ultimate efficiency saving is to transfer to your customer labor that used to be done by your employees. I encountered this in dealing with my company’s HMO, NYLCare at the time. The monthly bill came with an extra employee added, someone we’d never heard of. We fired off a complaint and received a letter back from NYLCare, containing the following amazing paragraph:</p><blockquote class="calibre_30">We do apologize for the error on the billing. When the application for the client was sent to our corporate office it was sent in with your group number. Apparently the employee put the incorrect number on their application. There is no way to know when an application is received that it does not belong to the group shown. The office would have to call on every application received and as there are thousands received daily, that would be impossible. The error is being corrected so please deduct the $203.70 from your bill. The credit will show on the next bill.</blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_12">I particularly like the part “there is no way to know … that it does not belong to the group shown.” There is, in fact, no way to know without checking. And checking, as the letter points out, can be damned expensive. So the effort of checking was adroitly transferred over to the client. (We should have sent them a bill.)</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_98"></div>
