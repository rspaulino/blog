Over the years, I have come to believe that this kind of competition is almost never explicitly designed into an organization; rather, it happens without anyone really wanting it. And the manager who excuses it (who almost seems to be taking credit for it) is a sad example of the self-deluding authoritarian who assumes that anything that happens must necessarily have been exactly what he/she intended to happen.</p><p class="calibre_12">It’s interesting to speculate on how the competition does arise. When siblings are competitive, it’s often a result of being undernourished in some sense, feeling deprived of attention, affection, feedback, or approval. Maybe competition among peer managers and the danger in their white space are due to the same sort of undernourishment. Maybe it is the ungiving, strict authoritarian nature of some upper managers that engenders competition, or at least lets it happen.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_145"></div>
