In the middle of our luncheon, conversations at all tables had to grind to a stop as a maintenance worker approached with his leaf sweeper roaring. Opposite me, Sally was looking less than pleased. I used one of those all-purpose male shrugs to convey that the fellow would soon be gone. Five minutes later he turned the blower off and disappeared.</p><p class="calibre_12">“Stupid blowers, ” Sally muttered in the new silence.</p><p class="calibre_12">“Oh well, ” I said, “it is a laborsaving device, I suppose.”</p><p class="calibre_12">She gave me one of those don’t-guys-ever-see-anything-except-the-obvious? looks. “It’s not a laborsaving device,” she said, “it’s a face-saving device.”</p><p class="calibre_12">She had a point. Sweeping is about the lowest-status job on the planet. If the worker uses a broom or rake and works quietly, everyone can ignore him. That’s fine for everyone else but maybe not so great for him. The worker is ignorable, invisible, and has zero status. Give him a blower, on the other hand, and he becomes the focus of everyone’s attention, the only possible focus. Whether the job gets done any faster is perhaps not what matters most to the worker. His boss has a similar consideration: It’s nearly impossible to keep people who have zero-status jobs; give the guy a nice loud machine to boost his ego and maybe he’ll stick around for a while.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_68"></div>
