That’s because an outsider is not familiar with an article of faith common to many managers and project personnel: the idea that starting any endeavor out with a highly aggressive (i.e., impossible) delivery date may not actually achieve the date, but at least won’t do the effort any harm. So, for example, if you set out to bring a project to completion in twelve months, and it actually takes you eighteen, you console yourself by saying, “Thank goodness we started out fast. Otherwise we might still be working on the stupid thing.”</p><p class="calibre_12">I’ve called this idea an article of faith. Like religious articles of faith, it is a premise that the believer is obliged to accept without question. In fact, there may even be an element of sin associated with doubt. To a nonbeliever, the premise looks dubious at best, but the faithful <span class="italic">must</span> believe. Project managers are taught from their earliest years that striving toward even the most impossible schedule can do no harm.</p><p class="calibre_12">I am not a believer. The notion that impossible schedules <span class="italic">don’t</span> damage projects strikes me as ludicrous. If you set out, for example, to build a two-thousand-square-foot home in one week, your colleagues may warn you that this kind of performance is not consistent with reality. You reply, as did one of my client managers, “Who’s talking about reality here? We’re talking about the project plan.”</p><p class="calibre_12">A quick calculation shows that if you’re going to be done by Friday, you will need at least fifty skilled framers on the site and ready to swing their hammers no later than Tuesday. That means the foundation has got to be poured and (somehow) cured on Monday. When that doesn’t happen, you’ve got fifty framers staring at you all day Tuesday, wondering what they’re there for. Materials begin arriving long before they can be used and you direct the framers to off-load and store them, maybe even to build a shed where they can be protected from the weather. Plumbers show up before there is anything to plumb, and electricians are on-site but there is nothing to wire, so you direct them all to help the fifty framers build the shed. By the time you finally do finish the house, it will have cost you more and taken longer than if you’d started out with a more reasonable schedule. After it’s all over, I hope you won’t be inclined to delude yourself that starting off fast was a winning strategy.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_53"></div>
