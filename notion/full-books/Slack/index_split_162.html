If you set out to build a bridge, for example, the aggregate risks are things like these:</p><p class="calibre_21"><img src="images/00044.jpg" class="calibre_23"/> You might fail utterly to span the river and have to give up in disgrace.</p><p class="calibre_12"><img src="images/00044.jpg" class="calibre_23"/> You might succeed but only at exorbitant cost (a lot more than your investors agreed to pay).</p><p class="calibre_12"><img src="images/00044.jpg" class="calibre_23"/> You might get the bridge built eventually, but so late that lost income wiped out all potential profit.</p><p class="calibre_12"><img src="images/00044.jpg" class="calibre_23"/> You might neglect certain safety rules and thus cause the deaths of one or more of your workers.</p><p class="calibre_12"><img src="images/00044.jpg" class="calibre_23"/> You might put the bridge in place on time and on budget but be disgraced later by its collapse under non-extraordinary circumstances.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_12">When an aggregate risk actually happens, the entire venture is invalidated; you’d have been better off not to have undertaken it in the first place.</p><p class="calibre_12">The reason you do risk management is to reduce or eliminate the possibility of these overall failures, but it doesn’t follow from that that you can expect to manage aggregate risk directly. The essential business of risk management is managing the <span class="italic">component</span> or causal risks—that is, the set of things that can go wrong that might lead to aggregate failure. For example, inadequate technology or poor engineering are two component risks that could contribute to the aggregate failure to span the river. They are potential root causes of overall failure.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_162"></div>
