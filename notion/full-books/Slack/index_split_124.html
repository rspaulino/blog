Those parents and teachers wanted to show us how to gain their trust. But—let’s face it—they had an additional item on their agendas as well: They wanted us to behave. The model they gave us is therefore all about <span class="italic">deserved</span> trust. They didn’t tell us about <span class="italic">undeserved</span> trust, because their agendas would not have been well served by describing an alternative trust-gaining mechanism. The omission was a fair one given their objectives, but it leaves a key gap in our understanding of how leadership emerges. It leaves us believing this:</p><p class="calibre_39">You gain trust by demonstrating trustworthiness.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_12">That’s it. That’s the only way to gain trust (or so they implied).</p><p class="calibre_12">Like many of our firmware rules, this one looks a bit odd when reduced to black and white. Just how are you supposed to demonstrate trustworthiness without having something entrusted to you to demonstrate upon? Whatever that something is, it has to be entrusted to you beforehand, and therefore well before you really deserve it. The truth is that there is no possibility of achieving trustworthiness except through the mechanism of <span class="italic">undeserved trust</span>.</p><p class="calibre_12">All the time that our mentors were impressing upon us the necessity of demonstrating trustworthiness before trust is conferred, they were advancing us little dibs and dabs of totally undeserved (not-yet-deserved) trust for us to work on. The basic rule they were impressing upon us was quite at odds with the rule that they themselves were learning as part of their own increasing mastery of child-rearing. What they were learning was this:</p><blockquote class="calibre_22"><span class="bold">Parents’ Rule:    Always give trust slightly </span><span class="italic"><span class="bold">in advance of</span></span><span class="bold"> demonstrated trustworthiness.</span></blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_124"></div>
