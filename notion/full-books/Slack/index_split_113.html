This was essentially what President Bush was getting at when he said his country didn’t have the wallet. The missing “wallet,” as he saw it, was the extra increment of power that he needed to be able to lead toward better education. If it had been available, he seemed to be saying, then he would surely have succeeded.</p><p class="calibre_12">Lack of power is a great <span class="italic">excuse</span> for failure, but sufficient power is never a necessary condition of leadership. There is never sufficient power. In fact, it is success in the absence of sufficient power that defines leadership. The little acts of leadership you encounter every day are often performed by relatively powerless people, or by people whose capacity to enroll others far transcends their power to force compliance. After all, what does <span class="italic">enroll</span> mean if, as boss, you can instead <span class="italic">oblige</span> people to do whatever you tell them to do?</p><p class="calibre_12">Think of your own experience, not leading, but being led: Have you ever taken direction from someone who didn’t have the authority to make you obey? Of course you have. And how do you feel about that? How do you feel about the person who led you? Chances are, the more that person was operating successfully outside and beyond his/her designated authority, the more strongly you feel that you were lucky to have been touched by a real leader.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_113"></div>
