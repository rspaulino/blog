Sure, you already know it’s important to keep your <span class="italic">best</span> people. There is no question that losing one or more of these key players could jeopardize a whole project or an entire reporting period’s results.</p><p class="calibre_12">From listening to managers discuss the importance of people retention, I come away with an uneasy sense that many of these managers look at the entire matter as an exercise in keeping their stars happy. But it’s not only the stars that matter. Everybody matters. That’s not to say that everybody is competent, that nobody ever ought to be reassigned or fired or encouraged to look elsewhere. What I do mean to say is that each time someone quits on his/her own schedule, the organization suffers a loss.</p><p class="calibre_12">When I made the point earlier that knowledge workers aren’t fungible, I stressed that they don’t divide up well, that they aren’t easily able to cover different kinds of tasks, switching back and forth from day to day or hour to hour. Part of the reason for this is that one core capability that a knowledge worker brings to the task is <span class="italic">domain knowledge</span>. Whether this person is a designer, product manager, programmer, writer, consultant, or whatever, he/she comes with (1) a set of skills and (2) some explicit knowledge of the area in which skills are to be deployed. The skills alone aren’t enough. Domain knowledge is also required.</p><p class="calibre_12">The more important that domain knowledge is, the less fungible the people are. That means you can’t divide them up into pieces, but it also means that you can’t easily replace them with other people when they leave.</p><p class="calibre_12">The right way to think about domain knowledge is as a corporate capital asset, as dollars of investment in the head of each knowledge worker, put there by organizational investment in that employee. When that person leaves, the asset is gone. If you did a rigorous accounting of this <span class="italic">human capital</span>, you would be obliged to declare an extraordinary loss each time one of your people quit.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_39"></div>
