I don’t have handy data that show, for example, that 14.3 percent or 8.8 percent or 26.923 percent of corporate cultures are so perverse. But I offer the following as an informal indicator that angry management—just to take the last point of my numbered list—is a fairly common phenomenon. My indicator comes from that bellwether of all meaningful American trends, the glossy ad section of an airline magazine: An ad that appeared regularly in the airline mags for years showed a male upper manager, a “suit, ” seated at a table surrounded by other upper management types. The guy is absolutely livid: his skin is flushed, veins popping, mouth twisted into a jagged line. He is glaring out toward a subordinate and asking in wrathful exasperation, “What’s your excuse this time?” The other managers at the table look down in embarrassment.</p><p class="calibre_12">Lower down on the page we see that this is an ad for a day-timer, a scheduling aid. It’s one of those fancy ones with lots of features. The intended message of the ad, I guess, is that when you’re late on something and the boss gets mad at you, it probably isn’t your fault at all; it’s probably the fault of your inadequate day book. The stupid thing probably has insufficient dividers, tabs and clear pockets, or maybe it’s bound with not enough rings. If only you’d get yourself a really modern-day book like the one shown in the ad, the text tells you, such scenes would never have to happen to you again. So get off your duff and buy a new day book.</p><p class="calibre_12">Well, that’s the point the ad is <span class="italic">trying</span> to make. The point it conveyed to me is a little different. I think the ad is all about managerial anger. Notice that nowhere in the copy is there any acknowledgment of the brutality of the situation portrayed. This is a really ugly scene. The boss is calling down an employee, in public. This manager is furious and venting it in front of everyone. Some poor bastard (you, the ad implies) is withering under the onslaught. Yet the copy writers didn’t seem to feel any need to distance themselves from what was happening, no need to assure you that, “We really don’t condone this kind of extreme managerial abuse, but …”</p><p class="calibre_12">Suppose that the picture had showed instead an angry father about to rip into his kid with the buckle end of a belt. Suppose further that it was just an ad from a belt company. You can bet that the belt company’s copy writers would have rushed to assure you that they didn’t approve of this kind of child abuse. They would have had to distance themselves from blatantly unacceptable and antisocial behavior. But the scene of the angry manager is offered up as all part of a normal day’s work. No need to remark upon it, this is simply one more unfortunate instance of something that happens all the time in the workplace. It’s just the way things are.</p><p class="calibre_12">The fact that we don’t require any explanation for this kind of managerial tantrum means that we take it for granted. Oh, it certainly isn’t desirable, we sigh, but it does happen. Yes, it does; it’s part of a Culture of Fear.</p><p class="calibre_12">Angry managers are losers, hapless incompetents who are in way over their heads and haven’t got the faintest idea how to lead. In the long run, they will come tumbling down under the weight of their own fury. In the short run, however, they tend to cluster. That means that a few organizations end up with way more than their share. I mention this because from the inside of this kind of culture, it may not be at all obvious that the level of abuse you see around you isn’t common everywhere. It isn’t. If you’ve stumbled into such a situation, get out. Life is too short.</p><p class="calibre_12">Once established, the Culture of Fear gets in the way of everything that is healthy or worthwhile. Growth is stunted, change (improvement) becomes nearly impossible, morale is in the Dumpster. Meaningful achievement is always just out of reach. Good people leave and new good people stay away in droves.</p><p class="calibre_12">Of all the many bad effects that the Culture of Fear engenders, I shall provide detail here on only one. I want to focus you on this one problem because it is at once so damaging and yet so poorly understood. It is what I call …</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_79"></div>
