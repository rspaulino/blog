<p class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Wasting Time</span></span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_11">The first three hidden costs of extended overtime are dwarfed by the fourth, a tendency to waste normal workday hours in companies that are working a lot of overtime. When people are putting in thirty or forty hours a week of overtime, the basic hygienic acts of management to reduce daytime waste are for some reason suspended.</p><p class="calibre_12">I chided one of my clients, an engineering company in the Fortune 500, for all the overtime his people were working. “What would you do, ” I asked him, “if overtime were forbidden and you still had to make the schedule?” “Well, I’ll tell you one thing,” he answered promptly, “we’d sure have to do something about all these meetings.”</p><p class="calibre_12">I paused for a moment, hoping that the words that had come so readily out of his mouth would make their way back in through an ear. But no. He couldn’t hear what he’d just said. He missed it entirely.</p><p class="calibre_12">Meetings were not just a problem in his organization, they were an obsession. Meetings accounted for nearly a third of all his people’s time. Not only were there far too many meetings, the meetings were huge. The typical meeting I attended there had thirty or forty people present. At my initial briefing, my first day as consultant to the company, I endured a nine-hour presentation with half a dozen presenters, projectors and screens, Powerpoint slides, videos, and product demos. It was all new to me and so I got something out of the nine hours. But why on earth were there twenty-five other people present for my briefing, more than a dozen of whom never said a word? I’ll tell you why: It was the kind of organization that couldn’t conduct a meeting with fewer than two dozen people in a room. That was the culture.</p><p class="calibre_12">The oversize-meeting culture was made possible only because people were putting in so many extra hours to get work done. When we trimmed overtime, the first step toward sanity was assured. They had to cut way back on meetings and trim the population of each necessary meeting back to those people who were required to make whatever decision had justified the meeting in the first place.</p><p class="calibre_12">Meetings are only one of the ways that overtime organizations waste the time of their most essential human resources. Another is that workers tend to drop their interrupt discipline during daylight hours. Knowing that their peers will be working long into the night, they feel free to interrupt them willy-nilly during “normal” work hours. The result is that no one can get work done between nine and five, and so the tendency to work overtime is increased. The poor worker who is there at midnight has probably stayed at his or her desk after regular closing just in the hope of having some peace and quiet for a little real work. What a shame that the organization can’t give such workers a decently interrupt-and noise-free environment during standard hours.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_62"></div>
