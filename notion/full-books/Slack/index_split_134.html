This applies equally well to the people who conceive of the change and direct its implementation. Change can’t happen without risk, and risk-taking is only possible in an environment that can be tolerant of at least some failure. There is a paradox at work here: Making it okay to take risks and succeed in risky endeavors requires that you also make it okay to fail.</p><p class="calibre_12">If you’re having trouble with the notion that risk-taking requires tolerance for failure, consider the opposite: punishment for failure. Potential punishment is often justified as a way to assure success; it is more often a deterrent to taking any risks at all.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_134"></div>
