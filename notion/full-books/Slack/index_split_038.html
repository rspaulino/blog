They describe change as challenge, as the measure of <span class="italic">real</span> players. They talk up flexibility as a kind of Holy Grail. They exhort their underlings to strive for ultimate and total responsiveness to changing circumstances. Embrace change, they intone, adapt, accommodate, adjust. When the boss is done with the pep talk, people go back to work.</p><p class="calibre_12">Yes, an ability to change is essential. Like many good things, it costs money. How much should it cost? Only the time and energy of a substantial portion of the people who are now 100 percent busy doing work.</p><p class="calibre_12">Change represents investment. You invest in a change by paying for its two key components: conceptualization (or design) and implementation. This is work that can’t usually be done by an elite corps of change specialists; it needs to be done by the very people who are to be changed. The reason for this is not too complex: Change is not an ad hoc business—organizational death is right around the corner if change happens only when the change specialists get around to it. Ability to change has to be an organic part of the organization. Change has to be going on all the time, everywhere. It needs to be everybody’s business.</p><p class="calibre_12">That means that everybody needs to have some capacity to devote to change. This is time that people dedicate to rethinking how their piece of the whole works, and how it ought to work. Once the change is under way, more time is required to practice new ways and to master new skills. That’s the cost. The benefit is vitality and a firm grip on the future.</p><p class="calibre_12">Slack is the way you invest in change. Slack represents operational capacity sacrificed in the interests of long-term health.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_38"></div>
