Managers are now encouraged to manage to the objectives, to cause each indicator to move in the desired direction toward its selected target. A manager is declared to have succeeded completely if the objective meets or exceeds the target.</p><p class="calibre_12">An entire MBO company might have its production department managed to an objective of maximized units off the assembly line, its sales department managed to an objective of increased unit sales, a marketing department managed to an objective of advertising coverage per dollar, a personnel department managed to an objective of minimized dollars of overhead per employee, and so forth.</p><p class="calibre_12">The underlying premise here is that progress toward the various component objectives assures movement toward the organization’s overall goals, presumably profit, growth, and corporate health.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_103"></div>
