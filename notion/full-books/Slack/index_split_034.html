She will see control as her main growth opportunity. That doesn’t mean you can’t control her somewhat, only that you can’t control her completely. You have to give her some leeway, some opportunity to choose her own directions and make her own mistakes. Mistakes are important here. If she has control over her choices only to the extent that she makes the same ones that you would have made for her, she has no control at all. And of course she’ll know that. There is no fooling Eve.</p><p class="calibre_12">This question of control comes up primarily in choice of methods to get work done. As designer of the organization under you, you may believe that it is your responsibility to select how each task should be undertaken. Should the financials be presented in a simple spreadsheet or a simulation model? You decide on a spreadsheet. Should working designs and test plans be maintained on the Intranet or circulated on paper? You decide Intranet. Should there be a peer review of each and every work product? You decide yes.</p><p class="calibre_12">But now suppose that Eve and her teammates decide otherwise. Don’t expect for a moment that the authority vested in you by the powers-that-be will be enough to impose your way. These people are in it for growth, and the choices you’re making don’t allow them to grow. That’s why they’re looking to approach the work in a different way.</p><p class="calibre_12">If you have built up any reserve of trust, you may be able to cash a bit of that in to get your way on some key matters. But not all. And the reserve of trust is quickly used up if you dip into it too often.</p><p class="calibre_12">I offer the following model for control-sharing. If control is in some sense like salary, then control-sharing ought to be (or at least seem to be) proportional to salary. If you have ten people working for you and you make 25 percent more than each of them, then you get 125 “control points,” and they get 100 each. If control is exercised in those proportions—or seems to be—then Eve and all her colleagues will feel that their opportunities for growth are maximized. The trick is how to assure your own requirements of the organization with just those 125 control points. That is not a trivial task. (But then, whoever said that management was easy?)</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_34"></div>
