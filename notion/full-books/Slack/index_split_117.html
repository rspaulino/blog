(How About You?)</span></span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_11">Thirty-five years of public speaking have taught me this: The more successful I am at persuading a business audience of the need to make some difficult change, the more likely people are to come up to me afterward and say, “I wish my boss could have been here to hear you say that!” I must have received that comment three hundred times or more over my career.</p><p class="calibre_12">At first I thought these comments were a sign that my message was coming into the organization at the wrong level. I urged my agents to change their marketing approaches, to find me an audience that was situated higher up on the org chart. To my surprise, these higher-level managers made the same comment. They, too, had bosses, after all, and they, too, wished their bosses could have been there to take on the required change. Well, who wouldn’t? Wherever you’re placed in the chart (except, I guess, in the catbird seat), you have a boss, and your boss has more power than you do. If the change really is a difficult one, what a relief if he or she could make it happen instead of you.</p><p class="calibre_12">After all these years of hearing “the comment, ” it now provokes in me an entirely different response. When people tell me, “I wish my boss could have been here,” I know my message has landed and I’ve gotten it to exactly the right person. If the message had made no sense to the receiver, he/she would have wandered away without comment; if the message conveyed no call to action to that person, there would have been nothing to resist. The person who is wishing most fervently to thrust the responsibility onto some higher-up is the very person who knows that he or she <span class="italic">could</span> make the change happen, but of course it won’t be easy. It will involve managing upward and sideways, and perhaps calling in some markers from people all around the organization. An act of leadership is about to happen.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_117"></div>
