But in some corporate cultures, people aren’t <span class="italic">allowed</span> to be uncertain. They’re allowed to be wrong, but they can’t be uncertain. They are obliged to look their bosses and clients in the face and lie rather than show uncertainty about outcomes. Uncertainty is for wimps.</p><p class="calibre_12">I don’t have an easy answer for you if you live in such a culture. Certainly, public risk management is not going to be possible. You might still practice some risk management in private in your own domain—just because you’re obliged to lie to your boss is no reason to lie to yourself—but the benefits will be less than if it were able to become a common practice throughout the organization.</p><p class="calibre_12">A variation on the “uncertainty is for wimps” theme is the culture where managers are allowed to show a little bit, but not a lot, of uncertainty. The amount of declarable uncertainty is typically on the order of 5 percent. So if a project is expected to finish in eighteen months, a manager might get away with insisting on a two-month window, promising completion sometime from the beginning of month 18 till the end of month 19. But that’s it—that’s the maximum extent of uncertainty allowed. All that would be fine if the company had a strong record showing that it regularly predicted results within 5 percent of actual. Most of the companies I know that have the 5 percent maximum uncertainty rule built into their corporate culture are far less successful at predicting than that. They regularly achieve results that deviate from prediction by 50 to 100 percent. With that kind of track record, insisting on a 5 percent maximum uncertainty window just makes liars out of everyone.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_159"></div>
