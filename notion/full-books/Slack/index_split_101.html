The nature of risk is that it takes you away from your base of competence and into a new domain where you are effectively an amateur. That’s why it’s risky.</p><p class="calibre_12">Because modern market economics are in such flux, companies have to be aggressive risk-takers to succeed. But the efficiency imperative has the direct result of making them risk-averse. Yes, they tell themselves, we could move into this new (and probably promising) area, but only by sacrificing the important improvements we’ve made in these past years of patient and thoughtful optimization. It’s a powerful argument against any risk-taking, often powerful enough to balk the proposed change. Efficiency 1, Effectiveness 0.</p><p class="calibre_12">But wait. In the opening of this chapter, didn’t we agree that if we had to choose between effectiveness and efficiency, we’d choose effectiveness every time? That the alternative makes no sense at all? How, then, is it possible that companies are routinely making exactly the no-sense choice? What on earth would cause them to favor efficient over effective? I’ll tell you. It’s a management philosophy called Management by Objectives.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_101"></div>
