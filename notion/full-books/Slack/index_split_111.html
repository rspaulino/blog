The other doesn’t.</p><p class="calibre_12">Chances are you’ve encountered some of the inside-quote-marks kind of leadership in your own career, but just in case not, I offer the following example. In September 1989, President George Bush and governors of the fifty states convened a National Education Summit at the University of Virginia at Charlottesville. In his address to the group, the president thundered that American youth would be “number one in science and math by the year 2000.” He repeated this assertion in his State of the Union Address on January 31, 1990. And then … nothing. That was it. Just that vehement statement and vehement repetition that American students would be best in science and math. (I guess it was up to someone else to take it from there.)</p><p class="calibre_12">The context of Mr. Bush’s statement was that American students had recently performed dismally, finishing in the lower third on math and science test results among Western societies. So the president had to take things in hand and show us the way. As I write these words, we are midway through the year 2000, and guess what? American students are not first in math and science. Not even close. In fact, they’re still performing dismally, at about the level they were in 1989. This is an object lesson on where “leadership” can get you.</p><p class="calibre_12">In a sad footnote to the above, President Bush later observed that the United States “has the will but not the wallet” for education reform. The truth is exactly the opposite: The country had the wallet (in spades) but not the will. Creating the will was his job.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_111"></div>
