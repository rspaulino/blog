They ask plaintively, “Why can’t these guys ever meet their schedules?” The answer that the schedule might have been wrong in the first place only befuddles them. It’s as though they believe there is no such thing as a bad schedule, only bad performances that resulted in missing the scheduled date.</p><p class="calibre_12">There <span class="italic">is</span> such a thing as a bad schedule. A bad schedule is one that sets a date that is subsequently missed. That’s it. That’s the beginning and the end of how a schedule should be judged. If the date is missed, the schedule was wrong. It doesn’t matter why the date was missed. The purpose of the schedule was planning, not goal-setting. Work that is not performed according to a plan invalidates the plan.</p><p class="calibre_12">The missed schedule indicts the planners, not the workers. Even if the workers are utterly incompetent, a plan that takes careful note of their inadequacies can help to minimize the damage. A plan that takes no account of realities is not just useless but dangerous.</p><p class="calibre_12">When the schedule is wrong, the work goes on anyway, proceeding in some way other than as planned. The result is that the effort is necessarily hurt. Subtasks are taken in a wrong order, or declared done when they’re only half done, all to keep the fiction of the schedule alive as long as possible. When the difference between plan and actual is minor, it probably doesn’t matter much. But when the difference is substantial, when, for example, a project is scheduled to come home within one year and it actually finishes in eighteen or twenty-four months, the damage attributable to the bad schedule can be huge.</p><p class="calibre_12">The people who <span class="italic">set</span> the schedule, not just the ones who failed to meet it, need to be held accountable. The marketing manager, for example, who throws a tantrum to force a new project to commit to the one-year schedule has to accept responsibility when the project actually takes two. Forcing a project onto an unrealistic schedule is dangerous for the company and has to be made dangerous as well for those who impose the schedule.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_54"></div>
