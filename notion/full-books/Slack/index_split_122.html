Irony and sarcasm, pointed jabbing criticism, personal mockery, public humiliation, exasperation, managerial tantrums, eye-rolling: These are the true enemies of essential change. To make an organization change-receptive, you need to rout all of these various kinds of disrespect from the culture. Replace them with a clearly felt sense that people at all levels are to be honored for the struggle they’ve been willing to take on.</p><p class="calibre_12">During change, every failure has to feel like a treasure (for the lessons it imparts). The person who fails is a hero, the backbone of the change effort. Failure gains that person more respect, not less.</p><p class="calibre_12">Make this one essential change to your organization in order to make any other change possible.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_122"></div>
