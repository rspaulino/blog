How would you portray the company? How, in particular, would you make it <span class="italic">look</span> successful? One tempting answer is to convey its great success by showing everyone who works there to be immensely busy all the time. After all, you might reason, how would the company have become so successful if its people weren’t putting in substantial extra effort?</p><p class="calibre_12">My own experience consulting inside some highly successful companies (Microsoft, Apple, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Dupont, to name a few) cannot corroborate a relationship between busyness and success. Very successful companies have never struck me as particularly busy; in fact, they are, as a group, rather laid-back. Energy is evident in the workplace, but it’s not the energy tinged with fear that comes from being slightly behind on everything. The companies I have come to admire most show little obvious sense of hurry. They are more like an extended family, embarked upon a project whose goal is only partly expressed in getting something done; the other part of the goal is that all involved learn and grow and enjoy themselves along the way.</p><p class="calibre_12">Work, particularly knowledge work, can be extremely enjoyable. That’s why so many of us become addicted to it. If you take sensual pleasure in your work, and those around you are doing the same thing, if it’s clearly okay in your corporate culture to enjoy what you’re doing, chances are that yours is a company headed toward success.
