The corporate Quality Program, at its heart, is a mechanism for driving out defects. When it succeeds, it will help you produce products that are defect-free, or nearly so. But are those products good for anything? Maybe yes and maybe no, but either way, it’s not due to the Quality Program.</p><p class="calibre_12">That’s my gripe with Quality Programs. They focus on one easy and actionable aspect of quality and ignore everything else. They concentrate on something that is almost incidental to real quality and ignore what really matters. If my nine-point list of Photoshop’s quality were generalizable, it would suggest that a real Quality Program should spend one-ninth or less of its resources on defect prevention and removal, and the rest on assuring product uniqueness, usefulness, market impact, change of customer work modes, etc.</p><p class="calibre_12">Well, what of it? Something is better than nothing, you might think, and so a Quality Program that deals with only a ninth of what real quality means is still that much better than no program at all. Ah, but that assumes that such a program has no worsening effect on the other quality factors. Can you really assume that about your Quality Program? Consider the following awful possibilities:</p><blockquote class="calibre_22"><img src="images/00044.jpg" class="calibre_23"/> Defect prevention and removal efforts may add sufficient overhead to the overall process so that it is too slow and unresponsive to market needs.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_15"><img src="images/00044.jpg" class="calibre_23"/> A proposed new technology may be judged initially more error-prone than the current approach, and so the quality targets mitigate against its adoption, even though the new technology could make possible a whole new family of highly useful products.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_15"><img src="images/00044.jpg" class="calibre_23"/> Any risky new endeavor is likely to result in an increasing pattern of defects; the Quality Program thus may pit itself squarely against risk-taking efforts.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_15"><img src="images/00044.jpg" class="calibre_23"/> The Quality Program may engender a Quality Assurance organization which has the secondary effect of reducing quality control efforts within its partner organizations.</blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_12">More important than these relative quibbles is the co-opting effect that Quality Programs typically have: Since they lay claim to whatever magic the word “quality” has, they make it impossible to advance a quality argument for anything except defect-freeness. The loser here is the organization as a whole. The strongest argument for new product integrity and usefulness has been effectively silenced.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_95"></div>
