This model was based on our experience within the family. Dad was boss. The kids were supposed to take orders—they didn’t always, but they were always supposed to, and when they didn’t, there were sometimes “consequences.” Without any other idea of how things ought to work, we assumed the job would function in much the same way: boss = dad, and worker = kid.</p><p class="calibre_12">This model is also a common one in factories. Many of us who manage knowledge workers today are children of fathers who were factory managers in their day (my dad ran brass and bronze foundries in the New England states). So when our fathers came home with work stories, the stories confirmed that management on the factory floor was pretty similar to management within the family. There was authority, direct orders, obedience, and “consequences.”</p><p class="calibre_12">The factory/family model of management just isn’t applicable during periods of change. Some of the key rules are different, as I’ve set out above. But here I want to make a slightly larger point: The factory/family model—even in times of stasis—doesn’t apply very well to the management of knowledge workers. That’s because stasis in a knowledge organization is a relative term; it just means a time of somewhat lessened variability. The key tools of management in the knowledge organization are the tools of change management. </p><p class="calibre_12">Instead of authority and consequence (the management staples of the factory floor), the best knowledge-work managers are known for their powers of persuasion, negotiation, markers to call in, and their large reserves of accumulated trust.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_154"></div>
