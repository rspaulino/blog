<span class="italic"><span class="bold">THE NAME OF THE ROSE</span></span>, Umberto Eco’s captivating mystery story set in the fourteenth century, monks have been turning up murdered in a monastery known for its huge archival library. A visiting scholar, William of Baskerville, has heard a rumor that there is a copy in the library (the only surviving copy on earth) of Aristotle’s <span class="italic">Treatise on Comedy</span>. There is reason to believe that all the monks who have been killed had come in contact with the manuscript. This leads him to suspect the head librarian, Jorge, of being the murderer.</p><p class="calibre_12">William’s suspicion is borne out and he confronts Jorge, who tells him that the manuscript is just too dangerous, that all would be lost if its terrifying contents were ever to escape into the population at large.</p><p class="calibre_12">“If this book were to become … had become an object for open interpretation, we would have crossed the last boundary, ” Jorge tells him. For it is Aristotle’s heretical position, he continues, that laughter is an <span class="italic">admirable</span> and <span class="italic">desirable</span> thing.</p><p class="calibre_12">“But what frightened you in this discussion of laughter? ” William asks him.</p><p class="calibre_12">“Laughter, for a few minutes, distracts the villein [common person] from fear. But law is imposed by fear, whose true name is the fear of God. This book could strike the Luciferine spark that would set a new fire to the whole world.”</p><p class="calibre_12">Laughter dispels fear, Jorge goes on, and fear is our only real hope of salvation. “What would we be, we sinful creatures, without fear, perhaps the most foresighted and most loving of the divine gifts?”</p><p class="calibre_12">In the end, the <span class="italic">Treatise</span> is lost in a fire that Jorge sets to consume the entire library (so we’re all safe, I guess).</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_77"></div>
