But it’s no secret that managers work extra hours too. If you’re enticing overtime hours out of your people, you are probably obliged to stick around late into the night as much, or nearly as much, as they do. And you can’t loaf during those extra hours while your people are sweating on your behalf. If you’re not busy, at least you have to look busy.</p><p class="calibre_12">When overtime is the norm for workers, their managers tend to become pure workaholics. They <span class="italic">run</span> through their days, skip lunch, and put in far too many hours. I suspect they’re trying to impress someone, but not me. I’m much more impressed with a manager who never breaks a sweat, who never looks busy at all. I’m guided by a basic rule that has proved true in virtually every company I visit:</p><p class="calibre_38"><span class="bold"> Overworked managers are doing things they shouldn’t be doing.</span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_12">The main thing they are doing, the particular pathology of most overworked managers, is the subject of <a href="index_split_072.html#filepos151729">Chapter 12</a>. I won’t discuss it here, but will give you a clue: When managers are overworked, they’re doing something other than management; the more they allow themselves to be overworked, the less real management gets done.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_63"></div>
