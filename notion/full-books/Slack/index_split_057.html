You would sprint for a few hundred yards, then roll around on the ground clutching your gut and gasping for breath for a few minutes more before you could even think of making another short sprint. The sprint-gasp-sprint-gasp marathon would probably take you twice as long to complete as a more normally run twenty-six miles.</p><p class="calibre_12">That’s pretty obvious for running, but a bit less obvious when the equivalent of sprinting is overtime. It’s less obvious because knowledge workers who have just finished a short burst of sprinting (staying long into the night, for example) are obliged to cover up the gasping phase. They stay on the job, looking bleary and babbling a bit, but still there. Or they disappear unnoticed to catch forty winks in the backseats of their cars.</p><p class="calibre_12">The “long into the night” example is perhaps too extreme. A more typical overtime regime is something like this: ten- or eleven-hour days Monday through Friday plus significant weekend time, all of it amounting to sixty-plus hours for the week. In this scheme, you may get a full night’s sleep every night. It’s your personal life that pays the price for the extra time given to the company. Gasping, in this example, is the increasing pressure that your personal life begins to apply: strain on the marriage, kids acting out, eventually a sense of being used. Again, corporate culture requires you to conceal the gasping, but it’s there. It takes its toll in lost work hours, ineffectively spent time, reduced quality, and people tossing in the towel to search for more sensible jobs.</p><p class="calibre_12">Yes, but is this toll less than the net positive effect of the extra hours contributed by the employee? If it were, extended overtime would be a net benefit to the organization—no matter what its cost—and the manager who extracted it from his/her people would be doing good. If only management were so simple. It isn’t.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_57"></div>
