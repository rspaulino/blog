What’s your response to that? Is there any little voice inside you whispering, “Wait a minute here; let’s not hurry those folks along too much”? (If you don’t hear such a voice, I guess you don’t fly much.)</p><p class="calibre_12">Quality takes time. Even quality in the “defects only” sense takes time. So you might assume that a Quality Program for a development effort would, as its most important task, assure the quality of the schedule. I always assumed that. But so far, I have never come across a corporate Quality Program or a Quality Assurance organization that made any pretense of judging reasonableness of the time allocated for the work. What typically happens is that the schedule is set <span class="italic">before</span> the quality people come on board. Anything they do in the interests of quality happens after the date (which makes quality either possible or impossible) has been set.</p><p class="calibre_12">Seems all backward to me. I’d much prefer the opposite, in which the Quality Assurance organization did its work <span class="italic">only</span> at the beginning of the project, assuring reasonableness of schedule and work procedures, and then disappeared for the rest.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_96"></div>
