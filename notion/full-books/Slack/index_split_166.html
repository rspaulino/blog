Okay, so how fast is possible? How quickly could you do a given task? You have to imagine yourself working furiously, precisely on track, and with no additional stops to pull out. You’re maxed, your mental pedal is to the metal. This is the fastest the human knowledge worker can go. If we were talking about physical progress instead of intellectual progress, this rate would be dubbed “breakneck speed.” The Hurry Up mantra is instructing us to do knowledge work at breakneck speed.</p><p class="calibre_12">Now, where do you suppose the term “breakneck speed” came from? Why do we call it that? That’s an easy one. At such a rate, you are positively courting disaster. You’re holding nothing back. (If you were, then there would be some additional speed possible, so you would speed up and then you’d be holding nothing back.) Your speed puts you on the brink of a disastrous spill and all its attendant consequences. One minor misstep and all is lost. Hmmm. Does that sound like risk management to you?</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_166"></div>
