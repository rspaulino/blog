<span class="bold">OFFICIALLY ENTERED</span> the workforce as a full-time employee on September 3, 1963. I showed up early that morning at Bell Telephone Laboratories’ Holmdel, New Jersey, facility. My boss, Lee Toumenoksa, received me in his office and gave me the little Welcome to the World of Work lecture that he’d probably given to dozens of other just-out-of-college kids before me. The first matter he dealt with was the official workday: Work began, he told me, at 8:15 A.M. and continued until 4:45 P.M. We were expected to take an hour for lunch, so that worked out to a seven-and-a-half-hour day, a 37.5-hour week. Lee told me he was a bear about the 8:15 starting time. “Do me a favor,” he said, “and don’t ever come in a little bit late. If you have to be late one day for some reason, be two or three hours late, not two or three minutes late. If you’re coming in ‘on time,’ then I expect you to be here and working by 8:15.”</p><p class="calibre_12">Before I left Lee’s office that morning, I’d had one thing fairly energetically imprinted on my newly minted work ethic: I owed the Labs seven and a half hours of work every single workday. Not less and not more. This was “the deal” of my employment. Shortchanging the Labs on work hours would have been a cheat, just as much as if they shortchanged my paycheck.</p><p class="calibre_12">Why seven and a half hours? That number was consciously designed into the structure of Bell Telephone Laboratories every bit as much as the hierarchy of management and the package of benefits were designed in. Lee and his colleagues in upper management had come to the considered opinion that seven and a half hours was the right amount of time to ask an employee to work. Less than that, they concluded, would have wasted a resource that was available to them. More would have caused the quality of work to suffer or would have made “the deal” of employment enough less attractive that fewer new employees would accept offers and more veterans would wander away to the competition.</p><p class="calibre_12">The decision to work overtime or to encourage others to do so is to override a fundamental design decision, one of the intrinsics of the enterprise. It is to say that that decision was wrong in the first place, that seven and a half hours, for example, was simply too little. It is the assertion that altering the deal to extract ten or eleven or twelve hours per day for the same pay will be to the organization’s real advantage.</p><p class="calibre_12">This is an extremely dubious proposition. Companies the world over have standardized a work regime for knowledge workers that is on the order of seven or eight hours per day, five days a week. If you were to tinker with this by a few minutes either way—particularly if you had a good reason for doing so and some empirical evidence to back you up—I could hardly quibble. But when companies institute overtime, it’s not minutes per day they’re looking for. They increase the workday by huge increments, typically 40 or 50 percent. And they almost never have the courage to institutionalize this decision by redefining the official workday. I think they’re kidding themselves.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_55"></div>
