Some companies have always been prone to trade away the future to make the present look a little more rosy. In the short term they prosper, and in the long term they don’t. What’s different this time? The difference is that today even the companies that didn’t cut the heart out of their effective change centers have made it more difficult for those centers to operate. Change and reinvention require a commodity that is absent in our time as it never has been before. That commodity—the catalytic ingredient of all change—is slack. Slack is the time when reinvention happens. It is time when you are not 100 percent busy doing the operational business of your firm. Slack is the time when you are 0 percent busy.</p><p class="calibre_12">Slack at all levels is necessary to make the organization work effectively and to grow. It is the lubricant of change. Good companies excel in the creative use of slack. And bad ones can only obsess about removing it.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_16"></div>
