<p class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Lister’s Law</span></span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_11">If your workers were galley slaves and your lever were a whip, you might expect that applying the whip would make them pick up the work pace. More whipping makes them row faster until they just can’t row any faster because they are maxed out. The pressure vs. work rate model shown above is more or less confirmed, for galley slaves at least.</p><p class="calibre_12">But the people who work for you aren’t galley slaves. They are knowledge workers. I am about to reveal to you an astounding fact about knowledge workers and how they are different from galley slaves. The second you digest this fact, you will find it difficult to remember that you didn’t always know it was true. You will persuade yourself that you always knew it. (But if you always knew it, you might wonder why you have been prone to use pressure the way you have.) The astounding fact comes from my friend and colleague Tim Lister.</p><blockquote class="calibre_22">“People under time pressure don’t <span class="italic">think</span> faster.”<br class="calibre1"/>   —Tim Lister</blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_12">Think rate is fixed. No matter what you do, no matter how hard you try, you can’t pick up the pace of thinking.</p><p class="calibre_12">Lister’s astounding fact tells us that the galley slave model is entirely wrong for knowledge workers. Since they can’t alter the rate of mental discriminations (basic elements of knowledge work) per second, their potential to respond to pressure is severely limited. All they can do is</p><blockquote class="calibre_30"><img src="images/00044.jpg" class="calibre_23"/> Eliminate wasted time</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_40"><img src="images/00044.jpg" class="calibre_23"/> Defer tasks that are not on the critical path</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_40"><img src="images/00044.jpg" class="calibre_23"/> Stay late</blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_12">Well, you might think, it’s too bad they can’t pick up the work pace, but given that they can’t, the three ways they tend to respond to pressure all sound constructive. Who could argue, for example, against routing out waste? And I would agree. But while the direction of these actions may be correct, the magnitude is limited. In a healthy knowledge-worker organization, people don’t waste a lot of time anyway, since wasted time is an affront to them as much as it is to their management. They are more likely to be frustrated by wasted time than enjoy it. If they aren’t wasting much time even in the no-pressure situation, they won’t make much improvement when the pressure increases. Similarly, people aren’t inclined to work on tasks in the wrong order, since they derive satisfaction from accomplishment, and a motivation toward meaningful accomplishment tends to steer them onto the critical path. A little pressure might decrease wasted time slightly and cause an equally slight improvement in focusing on the critical path.</p><p class="calibre_12">Staying late is quite another matter. In the short term, it can certainly have an impressive effect: A worker might stay one day until midnight, for example, and actually accomplish twice as much in this extended day as he/she would have accomplished in a normal day. But the likelihood of realizing this same gain by staying late the next day and the day after is rather poor. In any event, the most dedicated worker can’t put in nearly enough extra time over the course of months to get the kind of performance increase suggested by the galley slave model. There just isn’t enough time in the day, and besides, the increasing pressures from family and personal life will soon tend to right the balance.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_48"></div>
