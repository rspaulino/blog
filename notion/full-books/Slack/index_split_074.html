It shouldn’t be necessary to say this to any manager, but unfortunately it is: Management matters. Yes, the uncovered task matters too, but not as much. I have known managers who took on as many as three full jobs reporting to their own management position. Needless to say, the lower-level jobs were badly performed and there was no management at all.</p><p class="calibre_12">Why do managers need to be told that management matters? At least in the United States and western Europe, there is a strange lore about management that in spite of the substantial salaries paid for it, it really isn’t essential to the proper running of the organization. In fact, the lore tells us, management is often <span class="italic">in the way</span>. I have almost never been in an organization where there weren’t little jokes about this: “You can get a ton of work done around here when the Big Boss Lady is out of town, ” or “Somebody persuade Lawrence to take his vacation next week and we might actually be able to make the deadline.” These are not just jokes told about us by our staff people; they are jokes that we tell as well.</p><p class="calibre_12">The little jokes wouldn’t be funny enough to tell if there weren’t at least a germ of truth behind them. The germ of truth is this: Managers don’t <span class="italic">perform</span> any of the services or <span class="italic">make</span> any of the products that our customers pay for. It’s the people who report to them that do this work. So each time a manager intervenes in a worker’s day, it distracts that worker temporarily from revenue-producing activities. The distraction is probably useful in the long run (because, for example, it effects some new way of doing the work), but in the short run it distracts. In the short term it’s just a bother.</p><p class="calibre_12">The lore may be everywhere, but that doesn’t mean you have to buy into it yourself. To do your job correctly and well, you need to foster an attitude that is quite the opposite. You need to understand that management (the management that you provide) is utterly essential. It is. Good management is the lifeblood of the healthy corporate body. Getting rid of it to save cost is like losing weight by giving blood.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_74"></div>
