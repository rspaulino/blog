She was proposing to convoke an ad hoc group of local “digerati” to advise her on the formation of a new Information Sciences curriculum for the school. I unhesitatingly signed on. During our introductory meeting over lunch, I asked her one of my standard consultant’s questions: “Deborah, if I followed you around during a typical workday, what would I see?”</p><p class="calibre_12">She paused for only a moment before replying, “You’d see a woman who spends at least a third of each day being her own clerk, standing in front of a copier, filing, running errands …” She went on to explain that due to economies in the university budget, the dean had no support staff. Whatever needed to be done around the office, she was the only choice to do it.</p><p class="calibre_12">I find the image of “dean making copies” rather troubling. It’s as much a commonplace of the industrial scene as of academia. It may be apparent in your workplace as well. How many of your high-priced managers and engineers and developers and designers are busy being their own clerks as you read these words? How much of your own time is spent that way? I hope you’re asking yourself, “What’s wrong with this picture?”</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_71"></div>
