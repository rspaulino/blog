Each time you add automation, you choose some particularly mechanical component of the work (that’s what makes it a good candidate for automation). When the new automation is in place, there is less total work to be done by the human worker, but <span class="italic">what work is left is harder</span>. That is the paradox of automation: It makes the work harder, not easier. After all, it was the easy stuff that got absorbed into the machine, so what’s left is, almost by definition, fuzzier, less mechanical, and more complex. Whatever standard is now introduced to govern the work will dictate (often in elaborate detail) how the few remaining mechanical aspects are to be performed.</p><p class="calibre_12">Process standards can be a highly emotional matter. There are “process wars,” as people begin to feel territorial about their vanishing prerogatives. After a new standard process has been installed, there may be blood in the corridors, a residue of bad feeling all around. After all that hullabaloo, I’m usually underwhelmed by the process itself. In my experience, standard processes for knowledge work are almost always empty at their center. So a new process may tell you, for example, the twenty-nine steps you <span class="italic">must</span> go through in the interviewing and hiring of a new engineer, but never give you a bit of guidance on the only thing that really matters: Will this guy cut the mustard? I see design standards that don’t tell you how to come up with a good design (only how to write it down), employee evaluation standards that don’t help you build meaningful longterm relationships with staff, testing standards that don’t tell you how to invent a test that is worth running. Each of these standards says, in effect, “I will dictate to you exactly how you must do every aspect of the work … except the hard part.”</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_91"></div>
