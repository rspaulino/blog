Reward After Performance is so much a part of the corporate world that you may not even be aware of it, but it’s always there. You receive a paycheck <span class="italic">after</span> you work for some period, not before. There is always the tacit understanding that should you not do the work, perhaps the pay won’t be there either. Similarly, the various kinds of soft compensation—praise, enhanced responsibility, esteem of coworkers—all come after performance.</p><p class="calibre_12">In times of change, the reward has to come first. Another way to say this is that the basic currency that pays for change is the set of “markers” you can call in for favors done and confidence earned in the past. Great change managers have got a lot of markers to call in. They have built a reservoir of trust and they tap into it to entice their people to embrace change.</p><p class="calibre_12">This is bad news for the new guy on the job who comes in as a stranger to organize and command a change. He has no markers to call in, nothing really to work with except a little “honeymoon capital.” It’s never enough to promise people that benefits coming at some later date will make the change all seem worthwhile. The harsh reality confronting this new manager is that the key activity of change management (the building of trust) had to be done before the change was even given a name.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_153"></div>
