The standards we depend on to give us choice in our lives are all <span class="italic">product</span> standards. Almost without exception, they are used to constrain the interface characteristic of a product, not the way that product is built. So Fuji is obliged to respect the ISO standard for size and shape of its film containers, for film width and light sensitivity, sprocket hole positions, edge smoothness, and a thousand other characteristics of the product. If they don’t, they can’t sell that film as 35mm, ASA400, or whatever. The standards do not tell Fuji how to make the film, only how the product has to present itself after it’s made. The particular recipe for the film—the series of steps it passes through on the production line—is left entirely to the maker. If Fuji decides to spray-paint the markings onto the canister before the film is inserted, while Kodak prints its markings onto its canister after insertion, that’s their business. The standard doesn’t touch on the how-tos of film making; only on the character of the end product.</p><p class="calibre_12">In manufacturing, there are certainly local how-to standards. So a company that extrudes aluminum moldings, for example, would certainly want to adopt a standard way to run all its extrusion stations, regardless of which of the many different molding patterns is being extruded at each one. This standardization of manufacturing process was the particular interest of an early-twentieth-century mechanical engineer named Frederick Winslow Taylor. His 1911 book, <span class="italic">The Principles of Scientific Management</span>, set out to do for the human aspect of factory work what the principle of interchangeable parts had done for rifles half a century earlier. Taylorism called for rigorous standardization of manual factory activity so that the human pieces of the process would be as interchangeable as the parts of the products.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_88"></div>
