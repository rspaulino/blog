There are two not-immediately-obvious aspects to risk mitigation:</p><p class="calibre_21"><img src="images/00044.jpg" class="calibre_23"/> The plan has to precede materialization.</p><p class="calibre_12"><img src="images/00044.jpg" class="calibre_23"/> Some of the mitigation activities must also precede materialization.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_12">I shall deal with these in reverse order, since the second is part of the reason for the first.</p><p class="calibre_12">Consider the risk of fire in a school. As long as it’s only a risk—a bad thing that may or may not happen—you don’t actually <span class="italic">have</span> to do anything about it. But when it materializes, the risk changes from merely an abstraction to a real-life crisis. Now you have to act. But if you haven’t done work in advance to prepare, some of the actions you most desperately want to take now are not going to be possible. You’d love to have a fire extinguisher, but nobody did the preparatory work of procuring, charging, and placing fire extinguishers. You need a bell to warn the children, but none was installed. You’d like to have the children perform a perfect fire drill exit, but no one has taught them how to do it.</p><p class="calibre_12">Since some pre-materialization work may be needed to make effective mitigation possible, there has to be a plan in place just to know what mitigation is called for and what preparation it will require.</p><p class="calibre_12">In the case of the school fire, you certainly knew before I came along that advance work would be needed. What’s not so obvious is that mitigation of business risks usually requires advance work as well. It may be intellectually clear, but there is a disturbing tendency to ignore such pre-materialization work because it violates an unwritten rule: Don’t do work that might not have to be done. We see this in particular when people are under pressure. (And who isn’t?) Give a manager a tight enough deadline and he/she reasons, “Well, I’m going to have to catch a break or two along the way to be finished on time.” Because the schedule is so aggressive, catching those “breaks” becomes an integral part of the plan. On the Plan for Success schedule, there is no time for work that might not have to be done at all, that, we tell ourselves, <span class="italic">won’t</span> have to be done because the breaks we’re planning to catch will make such work unnecessary.</p><p class="calibre_12">The minimum pre-materialization work for each risk is to sketch out a plan of what to do if the risk happens. Remember that these planned mitigation activities may eventually end up on the critical path, and pay attention that all their precedence requirements will be satisfied if that should happen.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_165"></div>
