It suggests that you manage change pretty much the way you manage the mail room or the Southwest Regional Office. Would that it were so!</p><p class="calibre_12">The sense in which you “manage ” change is more nearly akin to the management in that other optimistic term, “cancer management.” By this I don’t mean to imply that change is undesirable, only that it is uncertain of outcome and almost impossible to steer. It has its own course to run, and all your efforts to affect that course may have influence, but can never really be thought of as controlling. That’s not the fatal limitation that it may at first seem to be: Influence in the hands of a talented manager can accomplish more than full control in the hands of someone who is talent-free.</p><p class="calibre_12">Suppose you really do manage the mail room during the workday and then during the late daylight hours most spring days, you manage the local Little League baseball team. What are the differences between these two kinds of “management”? Well, during the day you can tell people once what to do and they pretty much do it. On the ball field, you have to say everything again and again to get the message heard. You have to remonstrate, repeat, correct, encourage, cajole, and motivate. Whatever you’re doing, you may have to start it over from scratch a few times. Your charges don’t always listen, they seldom obey; they seem a million miles away while you try to get their attention, and the next kid up to bat may be off in the woods taking a leak. This is the kind of management that change managers are good at.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_151"></div>
