The caption is L•E•A•D•E•R•S•H•I•P, but what the image really conveys to me is “followership.” After all, most of what you see is nose-to-tail followers.</p><p class="calibre_12">Similarly, when I listen to executives wax loquacious on the importance of leadership, I’m often impressed that the real message they’re conveying has more to do with followership than leadership. They’re trying to instill an ethic of followership in the organization. The leader, as they see it, is an elite, and the great mass of (unwashed) workers is supposed to follow that elite. The problem with an ethic of followership is that it makes leading the exclusive domain of the anointed elite.</p><p class="calibre_12">The most exciting companies I know have no ethic of followership at all. By that I mean that people sometimes follow, but they are not <span class="italic">innate</span> followers. In such companies, leadership is everybody’s business, and following someone who’s got the inspiration of the moment is also everybody’s business. Leadership is a rotating function. Following whoever has got the hot hand is a side effect.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_118"></div>
