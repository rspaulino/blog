Offense is the effort you put into scoring against your opponents, and defense is the effort you apply to stop them from scoring against you. Those who suggest that “a little healthy competition can’t hurt ” are thinking only of the offense part. They reason that “scoring,” whatever that means in context, can be aligned through clever management to something that is beneficial to the organization as a whole. That way when the individual connects, the organization is also a winner. It is possible, I suppose, to align winning for the individual with winning for the organization, but it is never easy. This kind of alignment comes perilously close to Management by Objectives and is thus subject to all of MBO’s failings, in particular dysfunction. When dysfunction happens, the individual scores and the organization comes out the loser.</p><p class="calibre_12">The offense component of internal competition is problematic, but the defense component is always injurious. When peer managers play defense against each other (try to stop each other from scoring), they are engaging in anticooperation.</p><p class="calibre_12">Instead of encouraging competition and then depending on abstract notions like professionalism to discourage a natural inclination to play defense, companies have to learn to rout out competition between managers. Danger in the white space might help an organization to be efficient, but it will never allow it to become effective.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_147"></div>
