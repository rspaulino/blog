But quality? The corporate Quality Program? The “quality is job one” mentality? How can these be anything but wonderful?</p><p class="calibre_12">Quality has not just been the mind-set for the past decade; it has risen to the status of movement. The Quality Movement today is pushing a billion dollars a year of conferences, books, programs, seminars, urgent exhortations, and cloying posters.</p><p class="calibre_12">Most of this is little more than lip service. Paying lip service to quality doesn’t necessarily make it better. Quality in this sense is a lot like apple pie and motherhood. The United States and other Western cultures have spent the last fifty years extolling the virtues and talking up the importance of apple pie and motherhood, and yet during this same period both apple pie and motherhood have suffered a precipitous decline in their fortunes. The store-bought, packaged, plastic apple pie we eat today would make our grandmothers cringe. And motherhood, particularly in the ghettos and poor suburban neighborhoods, has become, for many, more of a curse than a blessing. This in spite of our constantly stated affirmation. We might as well have saved our breath.</p><p class="calibre_12">My problem with the Quality Movement is not that it costs too much or that it saps too much energy out of our organizations. My problem is that it is too little service and too much lip service. And, as I will show in this chapter, our ubiquitous quality improvement programs just make real quality improvement harder.</p><p class="calibre_12">An absence of slack makes quality programs seem like a cruel joke. When there is neither time nor staff to cope with work that runs more slowly than expected, then the cost of lateness is paid out of quality. There is no other degree of freedom. Lost time in the early or middle stages is offset by reductions in the later work, and quality suffers. My beef with organizations that make this tradeoff is not only that they put out shoddy products; my main objection is that they never stop proclaiming their dedication to quality while they’re making the very tradeoffs that make quality impossible.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_93"></div>
