<p class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Both Sides (Deserve to) Lose</span></span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_11">In this example, Seller Corp. is the rascal. They were the ones who shouted down the voice of reason and bound themselves to do what was impossible from the start. They did that for the most venal motive: to stop Buyer from contracting with a competitor at what, in retrospect, might have been a fair price and schedule. They made a terrible deal in order to have the short-term benefit of winning the contract. Then they tried to negotiate for more time, hold up Buyer for more money, and deflect blame any way they could.</p><p class="calibre_12">Seller is largely culpable here, but the other party to the contract may have incurred some responsibility as well. I am not trying to predict how the court will decide, only to point out that Buyer may have brought some of the disaster on itself by negotiating too strenuously. But hold on there, you might argue, isn’t that what negotiating is all about? Those negotiating seminars you see advertised so much would certainly support such a view; they teach that the negotiation is not really successful until you have positively screwed the other side. Screwing the other side, of course, is a perfectly reasonable goal in a Culture of Fear organization. And that’s why so many of them end up in litigation. But in the wider world it doesn’t make sense at all.</p><p class="calibre_12">If you are determined to avoid litigation, then you need to negotiate with an entirely different strategy. The strategy I would urge upon you is what the author Verna Allee calls the <span class="italic">principle of fair exchange</span>.<a id="filepos190386"></a><sup class="calibre6"><small class="calibre7"><a href="#filepos192967"><span class="calibre8">1</span></a></small></sup> Simply stated, this principle requires you to arrive at an agreement that would be equally acceptable to you from either side. In other words, you would be willing to sign as either party. Buyer Corp., in the example above, has responsibility to know whether the price and schedule offered by Seller are doable. If they aren’t, if the terms are weighted too strongly in Seller’s favor, Buyer should not enter into the agreement. If Buyer can’t understand the whole subject well enough to make that determination, it has no business entering into the contract.</p><p class="calibre_53"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Litigation and Slack</span></span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_11">A troubling aspect of many litigations is that employees of the guilty party (or parties) almost always knew that something was amiss. They knew, for example, that the contract was flawed from the beginning, that deadlines or performance targets were unrealistic, or that they would have to use some artifice along the way to beef up the price. They make devastating witnesses against their own cause because, testifying under oath, they can’t conceal their early knowledge. Many of them will have written imprudent (i.e., honest) memos or e-mails to their management, making what eventually will become their litigation opponent’s case.</p><p class="calibre_12">Why do good people get themselves into this dreadful stew? The root cause of bad contracts (contracts in which the principle of fair exchange is not respected) is stress. Someone in authority has trumpeted, “Don’t tell me it can’t be done by April. I am the vice president!” And so authority is used to trump reality … briefly. Those lower down on the totem pole suppress their reservations and try to put on a good face, for a while at least.</p><p class="calibre_12">A good contract requires slack. If a vendor commits to × by a given date, you act to your own peril to accept that commitment unless you can see that the vendor has left itself sufficient slack. If there are two competing vendors with different prices and the difference is explained by the fact that the cheaper one has cut all slack, then you court the disaster of litigation by choosing the low bidder. Similarly, if you are bidder, you need to know there is sufficient slack in the contract terms to cover reasonably expected risks.</p><p class="calibre_21"><sup class="calibre6"><small id="filepos192967" class="calibre7"><a href="#filepos190386"><span class="calibre9">1</span></a></small></sup>Allee, Verna, “The Ethics of Knowledge,” <span class="italic">Executive Excellence,</span> May 2000.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_86"></div>
