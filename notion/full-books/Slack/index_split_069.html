Consider the ubiquitous word processor, Microsoft Word or whatever you use. Before word processors, managers had to be given secretaries to type their letters, reports, and memos. Today those same managers do their own typing, all made possible by that laborsaving device the word processor. Net saving to the corporation: whatever it used to cost to keep the secretary.</p><p class="calibre_12">Well, not quite. If it would take a secretary without word processing an hour to type a given report, the manager with word processor can probably also get it done in an hour. More than half of that time is properly considered composition time, work that the manager would have had to do anyway. But what about the rest? What about the time that the manager fiddles with margins, corrects spelling, worries the table into position so it doesn’t break across pages? All that is truly clerical work that is now performed by a boss instead of a lower-level person. While we’re at it, what about the time that same manager spends installing the program, resolving its weird conflict with the spreadsheet program, looking up the rules for footnotes and other seldom-used features, trying to figure out how to flow text around a graphic?</p><p class="calibre_12">The word processor is a laborsaving device (please don’t take mine away!), but it has also served a face-saving role, enabling us to transfer a class of what was previously considered clerical work up to higher-paid workers. It’s not at all obvious that companies have come out entirely ahead by this switch.</p><p class="calibre_12">Word processing is just one example. Most of the neat things that your desktop computer does for you today were, in the pre-computer world, handled by clerks, typists, mail room workers, librarians, researchers, and interns, people who typically made a lot less money than you do. Today your PC does some of their work, but you have to drive it, you have to serve <span class="italic">its</span> needs.</p><p class="calibre_12">Use of face-saving schemes to push clerical work upward (usually to managers or to knowledge workers) has given us organizations that are critically starved of low-level support. Workers with six-figure incomes are standing in line at copiers, and sorting and filing and generally doing work that could be done by a clerk. I seldom visit a company anymore that could not be made more efficient by the introduction of even a few gofers. When a low-level employee off-loads someone who makes six or eight times as much, the organization is a big winner.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_69"></div>
