What may not be so obvious is that the Culture of Fear plays an important role in much of modern litigation. In my work as an expert witness and litigation consultant, for example, I seldom see a case where there isn’t at least one Culture of Fear organization involved. And since we expert witnesses are a close-knit fraternity, I get to hear juicy details on many more cases than I can work on firsthand. My sense is that perhaps a tenth of all U.S. corporations are substantially fearful, but more than half of those involved in litigation are true Culture of Fear organizations.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_81"></div>
