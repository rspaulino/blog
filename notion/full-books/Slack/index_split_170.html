As you read these lines, someone in your company is starting a new initiative to do something the company has done a thousand times before. It may be another client-server conversion, or a minor upgrade to plug a slightly faster chip into an existing processor, or a pro forma redesign of last year’s vehicle with last year’s engine and last year’s transmission but a new dashboard layout and different fenders. These “initiatives” are virtually risk-free … so it’s time to stop doing them.</p><p class="calibre_12">The only new initiative you can afford to take on today is one that is full of risk. It’s got to be something that thrusts you into a new market or exploits a brand-new technology, one that transforms your company at the same time that it transforms your clients and the way they work. If you identify any project as risk-free, or even relatively risk-free, cancel it. You’re going to need the resources and calendar time to do something transformational. And you will never get those resources or that time unless you stop doing the nontransformational work.</p><p class="calibre_12">If you’re doing some work that <span class="italic">could</span> be done without real risk management, that, too, is a clue that you need to redirect your resources. If risk management seems like overkill, you may be in full risk-avoidance mode. It’s true you don’t need risk management to come up with slightly swervier fenders or a new dashboard clock. But that is not an indictment of the technique; it’s an indictment of your overall strategy.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_170"></div>
