In the course of a normal year, I find myself visiting a dozen or more companies, agencies, and nonprofits, and working with employees of several hundred others at seminars and conferences. From my visits and from anecdotal evidence collected from seminar attendees and colleagues, I conclude that a third to a half of the organizations represented are overimproved to some extent. That is, their people are pathologically busy, frantic, and at least a little bit fearful.</p><p class="calibre_12">In such an organization, there is a characteristic mantra that goes something like this: “Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up …” I admit, there was a time during my novice years as a manager when I was gratified by this mantra. It made me feel that I was having impact. Today I think of that mantra as the sound of an organization going wrong.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_28"></div>
