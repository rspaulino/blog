Since it was developed by and for insurers, let’s begin by examining the idea in its original insurance context.</p><p class="calibre_12">If you are an executive of Lloyd’s of London or Aetna or John Hancock or GEICO, you will tend to think of risk management at the portfolio level. Your risks are not well managed if too many of your portfolio holdings (policies) are subject to loss due to the same catastrophic event. So, for example, too heavy a concentration of coastal Florida property policies exposes you to boom or bust: If there is no hurricane, you coin money, but if there is a hurricane, you may be wiped out entirely. What could you do to spread out this risk? What step could you take to assure that your downside is acceptable without forgoing all of your upside benefit (all those lovely premium checks rolling in from clients)?</p><p class="calibre_12">The prototypical insurance risk management action is to lay off some of the risk to another insurer, typically in exchange for one of that insurer’s own unbalanced portfolios of risks. You exchange some of your Florida property coverage for part of another company’s California disability coverage, or Hawaii workers’ comp, or key man insurance in Silicon Alley. Now if a hurricane strikes the Florida coast, you incur losses, but not so great as to bankrupt your company.</p><p class="calibre_12">Note the following from our insurance example:</p><p class="calibre_21"><span class="bold">1.</span> Risks are not inherently bad. (Risks are the entire reason there is money to be made in your business.)</p><p class="calibre_12"><span class="bold">2.</span> Risks don’t ever go entirely away. (You still have some loss when the bad thing happens.)</p><p class="calibre_12"><span class="bold">3.</span> Managing the risk costs you something (the work of laying off the extra policies and the penalty your partner companies may impose upon you before accepting some of your too-risky coverage).</p><p class="calibre_12"><span class="bold">4.</span> If the risk doesn’t materialize, risk management costs you something extra (the lost profit of all those property premiums in a year when there were no loss claims).</p><p class="calibre_12"><span class="bold">5.</span> The discipline is applied to the entire portfolio, not to any one of its constituent risks. (Having all your eggs in one basket—only one policy—gives you no way to assure that that policy won’t incur claims during the year.)</p><p class="calibre_21">All these things are true of risk management in the insurance business and will also be true of risk management in your business.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_156"></div>
