The nature of our work is that it cannot be done by any single person in isolation. Knowledge work is by definition collaborative. The necessary collaboration is not limited to the insides of lowest-level teams; there has to be collaboration as well between teams and between and among the organizations the teams belong to.</p><p class="calibre_12">In all fairness, managers who allow and encourage competition among their subordinates have not missed the need for cooperation among those very same subordinates. But they have persuaded themselves that competition won’t inhibit cooperation. They reason that the obligations of “professionalism ” will oblige their subordinate managers to help each other out when it is in the common good. When that doesn’t happen, they grumble about “unprofessional” behavior.</p><p class="calibre_12">This notion of professionalism strikes me as hysterically optimistic. When managers are given direct and explicit incentives to compete with their peers, it makes no sense to expect them to refrain from playing the game at all out of respect for a fuzzy abstraction like professionalism. And for all our preaching on the subject, professionalism is most often just a fuzzy abstraction. What, after all, does it mean to manage a department professionally? Is one to be guided by a professional ethic intrinsic to management per se or one intrinsic to the particular kind of work that department does (research, or claims processing, or public relations)? In any event, competition is not inherently unprofessional. It wouldn’t be unprofessional to compete to win against a rival company in the arena of the marketplace. It might not be a great idea under some circumstances: for example, in wartime, when you and your rival are both part of the war effort. We all take guidance from the managers above us as to where to direct our competitive energies; if that management steers us to compete directly with our peers, it can hardly complain that we’ve acted unprofessionally in doing so.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_146"></div>
