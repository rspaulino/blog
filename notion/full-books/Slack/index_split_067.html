<p class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Yes, but in the Real World …</span></span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_11">Since the company doesn’t pay for the extra hours, you might argue that <span class="italic">its</span> productivity (quantity of work done per dollar of cost) does go up when people stay late, even though the people become progressively less efficient during the extra hours. Enticing our gedankenexperiment worker to stay two more hours, for example, did get the company an extra 100 TUMD, in spite of the worker’s decline in real productivity. And therefore it did increase the company’s total output of work by 12.5 percent at no additional cost. How can this be bad? Well, it can’t, provided that you do really have a TUMD meter to confirm that total useful work per dollar paid is increased in the short run and stays at that level over the longer period. It’s only in the intermediate to long term that the negative effects of overtime show up.</p><p class="calibre_12">When people put in lots of overtime over an extended period of time, their net effectiveness is not just decreased during the extra hours; they begin to limp during the main body of the workday as well, due to built-up fatigue and reduced motivation. That can lead to less total work accomplished in a twelve-hour day than would have been accomplished in an eight-hour day. I made that point in <a href="index_split_055.html#filepos113786">Chapter 9</a>. My additional point here is that the perverse definition of productivity based on the fiction of ignored overtime hours can only increase the likelihood of lowered performance.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_67"></div>
