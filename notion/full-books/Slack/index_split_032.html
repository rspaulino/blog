I noticed from the start that there was almost no way to control the work that these people did. If you looked over their shoulders enough or imposed standards that were different from their own, they would shrug and walk away from the work, leaving you to do it yourself. Control, as they see it, is their payment for working. Deny the control or assume it yourself and they’re gone.</p><p class="calibre_12">That doesn’t mean you can’t control the quality of their product, only that you can’t <span class="italic">seem</span> to be controlling it. You have to impose your standard without seeming to do so, somehow causing it to become their standard. This is a troubling task for many managers, one that often causes them to flee the not-forprofit world and go back to the familiar for-profit organization where people do as they’re told.</p><p class="calibre_12">But people never really “do as they’re told.” The difference between for-profit and volunteer organizations is that in the for-profit world people do get paid and so they are willing to give up some control to the boss, to accept at least some direction. But they don’t give up all control. You couldn’t pay them enough for that.</p><p class="calibre_12">This was a great revelation to me as a manager. Without ever coming to grips with how much control workers were willing to give up to their manager, I had always assumed that I nonetheless had it all; that it was my job to control everything and their job to do everything. It took me a long time to see otherwise.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_32"></div>
