Some make the process formal, while others practice it almost casually as an integral part of the larger business of managing. No matter what your style, there are certain essentials. You can’t claim to be managing your risks unless you:</p><p class="calibre_12"><span class="bold">1.</span> List and count each risk.</p><p class="calibre_12"><span class="bold">2.</span> Have an ongoing process for discovering new risks.</p><p class="calibre_12"><span class="bold">3.</span> Quantify each one as to its potential impact and likelihood.</p><p class="calibre_12"><span class="bold">4.</span> Designate a transition indicator for each one that will tell you (early, I hope) that the risk is beginning to materialize.</p><p class="calibre_12"><span class="bold">5.</span> Set down in advance what your plan will be to cope with each risk should it begin to materialize.</p><p class="calibre_21">Finally, you will need to create some sort of model that shows how the sum effect of the component risks establishes your uncertainty about overall success. Such uncertainty is typically shown in risk diagrams such as the ones included in the previous chapter. There are usually separate diagrams for cost and schedule, and possibly other kinds of risk.</p><p class="calibre_12">Risk management needs to be dynamic. By that I mean that the overall declared uncertainty has to be updated over time. Each time a component risk does materialize or fails to materialize (and can no longer come back to bite you), the aggregate risk diagrams need to be updated.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_163"></div>
