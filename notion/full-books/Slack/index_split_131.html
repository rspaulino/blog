Oh yes, middle managers are also responsible for directing operations and other ongoing activities. But the distinction between companies that survive the turmoil of our changing economies and those that don’t is middle management in its change agent role. The survivors will have vital, confident middle management, particularly at levels 2 to 4. The nonsurvivors will be the ones who trimmed those midlevel positions to the bone during the nineties, and so terrified and disenchanted the middle managers still left that they no longer have the gumption to act.</p><p class="calibre_12">Let me restate this idea even more brutally: The companies who today find themselves stuck in stasis are that way because they fired the very people who were capable of helping them get through necessary change. They flattened themselves by getting rid of their change centers. (Here I mean the word “flattened” in both of its senses.)</p><p class="calibre_12">Part of the flattening logic had to do with identifying midlevel people with time on their hands and getting rid of them. This was called trimming fat. The fact that they had time on their hands made them fat.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_131"></div>
