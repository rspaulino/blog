I find myself in a room with a dozen or so other people, taking part in a weekly status meeting. All these meetings are pretty much of a kind. The boss makes a few comments and then subordinate managers take turns telling the boss what’s happening in each of their areas of responsibility. When Manager D is speaking his piece, you might see Manager G, a bit farther down the table, making a few notes. I’ve come to suspect that the notes almost never have anything to do with what others are saying at the meeting; rather, Manager G is making notes for her own few minutes of addressing the boss. Managers who have already had their moment in the sun affect a passive listening posture that is very close to asleep. When the managers stand up and exit the room, they will not typically see each other till the next status meeting.</p><p class="calibre_12">The status meeting I’ve portrayed is not really a meeting at all; it’s a ceremony. At a real meeting, <span class="italic">n</span> people put their heads together to arrive at some conclusion or to take some new direction that requires the input and participation of all. Taking turns talking to the boss is not a meeting in this sense. It is, rather, a ritual that acknowledges and celebrates the bossness of the boss. There is need for ritual in business, I guess, but let’s at least understand that the weekly status meeting is not really a meeting.</p><p class="calibre_12">And the management team is not really a team. A team is a group of people who have joint responsibility for—and joint ownership of—one or more work products. People who own nothing in common may be called a team, but they aren’t. This is not to say that companies never form real management teams, only that they do so rarely. Most of what are called management teams are a mockery of the team concept.</p><p class="calibre_12">When you find a real management team in action, there are a handful of managers who run their respective subgroups together. People in the subgroups are aware that their bosses are spending a lot of time with each other. (Sometimes they even complain about this: Their past experience has accustomed them to a manager who is alone in his/her office for much of the day, and therefore more available to them.) Decisions are made by the team and belong to the team. Responsibility and accountability are spread over the management team, just as they are in the lower-echelon teams that work for them.</p><p class="calibre_12">This modest diffusing of accountability is the “problem” cited by organizations that allow no real management teams. They trumpet the advantages of having each manager entirely responsible for whatever is allocated to him/her. The flip side of this simplistic accountability scheme is managerial isolation.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_142"></div>
