How else to explain the prominent and respected position that fear is given in so many organizations? How else to explain the “culture of fear” that dominates the workplace for so many?</p><p class="calibre_12">Among the characteristics of the Culture of Fear organization are these:</p><p class="calibre_21"><span class="bold">1.</span> It is not safe to say certain things (e.g., “I have serious doubts that this quota can be met”). And truth is no excuse for saying them.</p><p class="calibre_12"><span class="bold">2.</span> In fact, being right in your doubts proves that you must be the reason that the fondest wishes of those above you did not come true.</p><p class="calibre_12"><span class="bold">3.</span> Goals are set so aggressively that there is virtually no chance of achieving them.</p><p class="calibre_12"><span class="bold">4.</span> Power is allowed to trump common sense.</p><p class="calibre_12"><span class="bold">5.</span> Anyone can be abused and abased for a failure to knuckle under.</p><p class="calibre_12"><span class="bold">6.</span> The people who are fired are, on average, more competent than the people who aren’t.</p><p class="calibre_12"><span class="bold">7.</span> The surviving managers are a particularly angry lot. Everyone is terrified of crossing them.</p><p class="calibre_21">I hope that as you read these points you’re inclined to think they present a truly extreme picture. I hope this, since it suggests that yours is not a Culture of Fear organization. (If the portrait I’ve drawn does not seem extreme to you, you have my sympathies.)</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_78"></div>
