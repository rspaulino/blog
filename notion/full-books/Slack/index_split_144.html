They’d be better off to concentrate on the space between those lines and boxes. Since healthy organizations use this white space as their learning center, you can bet that the nonlearners have got trouble exactly in the white space. Instead of being vital and collaborative, their white space is isolating and dangerous to explore.</p><p class="calibre_12">An upsetting example of the problem was described by an attendee at one of my seminars when he told me over lunch, “I’m <span class="italic">afraid</span> of my peer managers.” He went on to say that at his company, managers were pitted against one another. He was made to feel that another manager’s success was his own failure and that, conversely, the other managers’ failures were good news to him. Of course the others felt the same way—that’s why he feared them. They were always looking for a chance to undermine his strengths or exploit his weaknesses.</p><p class="calibre_12">Where there is such “danger in the white space,” organizational learning—along with all other forms of cooperation and collaboration—grinds to a halt.<a id="filepos315634"></a><sup class="calibre6"><small class="calibre7"><a href="index_split_150.html#filepos327775"><span class="calibre8">1</span></a></small></sup></p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_144"></div>
