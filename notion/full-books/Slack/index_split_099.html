The two are not at all the same. You’re efficient when you do something with minimum waste. And you’re effective when you’re doing the right something. It’s possible to be one without the other: efficient but not effective, or effective but not efficient.</p><p class="calibre_12">Of course it is also possible to be both. Possible, but not easy. You ought not to be obliged to choose strictly between the two, but suppose you were. Which one would you choose? Efficiency or effectiveness? That’s pretty easy. An effective but not efficient organization moves steadily (though maybe not quickly) toward its real goals. How much progress it makes in that direction is a matter of how inefficient it is. An efficient but not effective organization, on the other hand, is moving in the wrong direction. The more it optimizes, the more progress it makes away from its real goals. Such an organization could say of itself, in Yogi Berra’s words, “We’re lost, but we’re making good time.”</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_99"></div>
