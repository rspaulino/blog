<p class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Dysfunction</span></span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_11">The second flawed assumption of MBO is that the net contribution of something as large and complex as a corporate department can be reasonably approximated by a single indicator (or, in a more advanced MBO company, by two or three such indicators).</p><p class="calibre_12">MBO’s objectives are always simplistic approximations. The total meaningful contribution of the few hundred (or few thousand) employees that constitute a typical department is far too complex to quantify. It simply cannot be expressed as a single number. But don’t worry about that, MBO tells us, do it anyway. Come up with the best simple quantification of performance you can, and let that stand for the more complex reality. So X, the selected objective, will stand for C, the organization’s total real contribution to the company’s ultimate health. We just have to assume that as X improves, C will also improve.</p><p class="calibre_12">This assumption is the equivalent of what I stated above as the premise that increments of X (assuming nothing else changes) will make their way into the bottom line. The rub here is that something else always changes. For example, a department managed to the objective of increased throughput may drive up its personnel turnover. The net effect of worsened turnover may more than offset the effect of increased throughput. When this happens, X has gone up but C has gone down. This is what Harvard professor Rob Austin calls <span class="italic">dysfunction</span>.<a id="filepos242411"></a><sup class="calibre6"><small class="calibre7"><a href="index_split_106.html#filepos244900"><span class="calibre8">1</span></a></small></sup></p><p class="calibre_12">Austin offers the following classic (perhaps apocryphal) example of dysfunction: The commissars governing a Soviet nail factory decree that henceforth the factory will optimize the number of nails produced. The factory puts out a record number of nails, all of them teensy-weensy little brads. Whoops, dysfunction: Objective was met, but overall well-being declined. Since nobody wants that many brads, the commissars revise the MBO objective. From now on, they decree, the factory will maximize the total <span class="italic">tonnage</span> of nails produced. Again the factory meets the objective, this time by producing only huge railway spikes. Dysfunction again. The poor Russian carpenter who was hoping for some #10 finished nails is still waiting.</p><p class="calibre_12">Believers insist that dysfunction is not an intrinsic flaw of MBO, but a simple matter of poor implementation. When dysfunction occurs, they (our era’s new commissars) refine and redefine the objectives and try again.</p><p class="calibre_12">After five decades of experience with MBO, its believers are still refining and redefining and still waiting for results. I’m ready to call MBO’s constant failure intrinsic. MBO is to an organization what Soviet-style central planning is to an economy: an idea whose time has passed.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_105"></div>
