The needed change is not just to do the same things still faster but to switch directions and do something else entirely. Change is always complicated and challenging, but in the superaccelerated corporation, change of direction is almost impossible. The very improvements that the Hurry Up organization has made to go faster and cheaper have undermined its capacity to make any other kind of change.</p><p class="calibre_12">An organization that can accelerate but not change direction is like a car that can speed up but not steer. In the short run, it makes lots of progress in whatever direction it happened to be going. In the long run, it’s just another road wreck.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_9"></div>
