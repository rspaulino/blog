<p class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Context for Blame</span></span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_11">The chemistry of Culture of Fear organizations seems to call for a fixed minimum amount of blame. In some companies, this minimum may even be written into policy. Consider, for example, G.E.’s policy that all managers be evaluated every year and the bottom 10 percent be fired. Prospering in such an environment can take two forms: Either you have to do relatively well, or some of your peers have to do relatively badly. Any failure by managers beside you on the org chart thus has the effect of reducing pressure on you. In such an environment, there is a natural inclination to view with suspicion anything that would constitute a big win for any other manager.</p><p class="calibre_12">In most of the litigations I see, there is serious conflict between rival stakeholders inside one (sometimes inside both) of the litigating organizations. There might be a sales department at Buyer Corp., for example, that stands to gain substantially if a successful Somethingorother were to be installed. There might also be a marketing department that stands to lose. And so the marketing department (particularly if Buyer is a Culture of Fear company) imposes a few restrictions of its own on the requirement, or contests some of the sales department’s most valued features. The requirement is bulked up, watered down, or made vague to satisfy both conflicted parties, and the result is lateness or overrun or delivery of something useless to everyone. Whoops, time to deflect upper management’s attention by suing Seller Corp.</p><p class="calibre_12">So far, my example has shown only the buyer, not the seller, to be the relatively blameworthy party. Clearly, it can be the other way around. Seller may fail due to its own incompetence to deliver a relatively well specified Somethingorother, and try to get off the hook by suing Buyer for a handful of late-arriving changes. Buyer will then argue valiantly in court that the amount of change was normal and only to be expected. It may be right in this, but it hardly matters. Everybody loses except those whose main goal was to deflect blame.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_84"></div>
