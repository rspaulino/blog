The reason has more to do with our frustrations and fears as managers than with any consideration of efficiency and good practice. Setting a standard for the process establishes ownership. If I am your boss and I impose no standard on you, I’ve effectively let you own the process. But wait a minute. Who’s boss here? I am. So don’t I need to own the process? I certainly need to be in control, don’t I?</p><p class="calibre_12">If the term “empowerment” is to have any meaning at all, it means putting process ownership largely into the hands of the people doing the work. That doesn’t mean there should be no standard, only that whatever standard evolves should happen at the level of the work itself. Ownership of the standard should be in the hands of those who do the work. That is an ideal, one that you will probably never be able to attain completely, particularly in big companies. But it is always worth striving toward.</p><p class="calibre_12">It’s also scary. In my management seminars, I often query groups of managers about empowerment. (They’re all in favor.) Then I ask these young managers, “When you empower a subordinate, do you yourself lose any control?” They gravely answer that no, they do not lose control. But that answer makes no sense at all. Empowerment always implies transfer of control to the person empowered and out of the hands of the manager. That doesn’t mean you give up all control, only some. You can’t empower anyone without taking chances. The power you’ve granted is the power to err. If that person messes up, you take the consequences. Looked at from the opposite perspective, it is this capacity to injure the person above you that makes empowerment work. It leaves the empowered person thinking, “Oh my God, if I fail at this, my boss is going to look like a chump for trusting me.” There is little else in the work experience with so much capacity to motivate.</p><p class="calibre_12">Process standardization from on high is disempowerment. It is a direct result of fearful management, allergic to failure. It tries to avoid all chance of failure by having key decisions made by a guru class (those who set the standards) and carried out mechanically by the regular folk. As defense against failure, standard process is a kind of armor. The more worried you are about failure, the heavier the armor you put on. But armor always has a side effect of reduced mobility. The overarmored organization has lost the ability to move and move quickly. When this happens, standard process is the cause of lost mobility. It is, however, not the root cause. The root cause is fear.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_92"></div>
