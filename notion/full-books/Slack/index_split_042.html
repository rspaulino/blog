However, a common feature of exit interviews is a sense that the departing person felt <span class="italic">used</span>. This leads to a disturbing paradox: The more successful a company is in extracting every bit of capacity from its workers, the more it exposes itself to turnover and attendant human capital loss.</p><p class="calibre_12">On the other hand, when people stay on, they are often motivated by the lure of personal growth. The organization’s agility, its healthy capability to take on change, is an important factor in supplying opportunities for such growth to the individual.</p><p class="calibre_12">Of course, other things matter as well. Managers who inspire extraordinary loyalty from their people tend to be highly charismatic, humorous, good-looking, and tall. So, by all means, strive to be those things. If you don’t feel able to improve any of those factors very much, you might consider holding on to your people by designing a little slack into their lives.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_42"></div>
