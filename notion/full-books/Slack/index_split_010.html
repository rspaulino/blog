How organizations tend to get more efficient only by sacrificing their ability to change. How slack can come to the rescue. </td></tr><tr valign="top" class="calibre_19"><td class="calibre_20">Part Two </td><td class="calibre_20">The effect of stress on organizations: It leads them badly off course while causing them to redouble their speed. Causes of and cures for corporate stress. </td></tr><tr valign="top" class="calibre_19"><td class="calibre_20">Part Three    </td><td class="calibre_20">Change, growth, and organizational learning: The difference between companies that can learn (and profit from their learning), and those that can’t. </td></tr><tr valign="top" class="calibre_19"><td class="calibre_20">Part Four </td><td class="calibre_20">Risk taking and risk management: Why running away from risk is a no-win strategy, and why running <span class="italic">toward</span> it makes sense when managed sensibly (and what that entails). </td></tr></table><p class="calibre_21"><span class="italic">Slack</span> is directed toward management at all levels in knowledge organizations and other modern corporations where knowledge workers predominate. It is also directed to the knowledge workers themselves. It’s directed toward you if you sense that there is something terribly wrong in the infernal busyness of the modern workplace, if you know in your heart that the slack that has been squeezed out of your organizations over the last ten years now has to be reintroduced, or no further meaningful progress will ever be possible.</p><p class="calibre_12">The fact that you’ve decided to read this book says that you are <span class="italic">busy</span>. You haven’t got time for an extended treatise on organizational forms or a theory of management. At most, you may have the time for a very fast, very pointed airplane read. I have put this book together so it can be read cover-to-cover on a flight from New York to Chicago or from Amsterdam to Rome. It is my hope and expectation that after reading it, you can step off your flight with a straightforward approach for helping your organization make the kinds of change it will need to make in order to survive.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_10"></div>
