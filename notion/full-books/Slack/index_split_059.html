<p class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Effect on Quality</span></span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_11">Knowledge work is, by definition, think-intensive. In any discussion of hiring new knowledge workers, we acknowledge implicitly that the quality of the candidate’s thinking is all-important; that’s what makes a great hire so much better than a less great one. What we are not so quick to acknowledge is what increases or decreases the quality of thinking during a day. Foremost among these is fatigue. Most knowledge workers, for example, will tell you that they really shouldn’t do any kind of error-prone work late in a work session, because they know their thinking is no longer sufficiently clear for that kind of task. Very often they consider that logic and then do the error-prone task anyway (proving, I guess, that fatigue affects strategic judgment as much as tactical).</p><p class="calibre_12">Extended overtime is not just something that companies do to their workers; workers also do it to themselves. You can’t discuss the subject intelligently without taking account of the addictive, almost erotic, appeal that deep and obsessive involvement in a task can have. There is a high associated with such efforts that may cloud your judgment a bit but still feels awfully good. It makes you feel like one of the heroes of <span class="italic">The Right Stuff</span>, Tom Wolfe’s marvelous recounting of the NASA space program:</p><blockquote class="calibre_30">Every young fighter jock knew the feeling of getting two or three hours’ sleep and then waking up at 5:30 A.M. and having a few cups of coffee, a few cigarettes, and then carting his poor quivering liver out to the field for another day of flying. There were those who arrived not merely hungover but still drunk, slapping oxygen tank cones over their faces and trying to burn the alcohol out of their systems, and then going up, remarking later: “I don’t <span class="italic">advise</span> it, you understand, but it <span class="italic">can</span> be done.” (Provided you have the right stuff, you miserable pudknocker.)</blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_12">What’s clear here is that the high, the narcotic of gonzo overindulgence, and the associated fatigue all combine to reduce the individual’s mental capacities. If the quality of thinking matters, then overtime is not a great prescription.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_59"></div>
