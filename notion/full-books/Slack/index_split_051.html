All of these endeavors are under pressure to deliver their products as soon as possible, but some of them are more stressed than others. In the most highly stressed projects, people at all levels talk about the schedule being “aggressive, ” or even “highly aggressive.” In my experience, projects in which the schedule is commonly termed aggressive or highly aggressive invariably turn out to be fiascoes. “Aggressive schedule,” I’ve come to suspect, is a kind of code phrase—understood implicitly by all involved—for a schedule that is absurd, that has no chance at all of being met.</p><p class="calibre_12">The key here is that the schedule be <span class="italic">patently</span> absurd; just not <span class="italic">demonstrably</span> absurd.

Now whenever I hear the words “aggressive schedule,” I think of heading for the exit.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_51"></div>
