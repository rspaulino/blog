A penny saved, they reason, is a penny earned. They know that’s true because they’ve heard it said so many times. With some trepidation, I now enter into direct conflict with the wisdom of the ages to suggest that</p><p class="calibre_39">A penny saved is <span class="italic">not</span> a penny earned.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_11">At least not all pennies saved. Cutting money out of this year’s expenditure for the company yacht might go directly to the bottom line, but cutting from R&amp;D is something else entirely. Because the R&amp;D expenditure is investment, trimming it may succeed only in moving profit from next year’s bottom line to this year’s. It may add to this year’s net but reduce the profit stream for next year and many years after. The present value of the future revenue stream is almost always much greater than the cost this year—that’s why you invest in R&amp;D. A penny saved from any kind of investment is never a penny earned.</p><p class="calibre_12">Slack is a kind of investment. Learning to think of it that way (instead of as waste) is what distinguishes organizations that are “in business” from those that are merely busy.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_44"></div>
