<p class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Fear (Reexamined)</span></span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_11">When you’re not safe, you feel afraid. And fear can inhibit change. Interestingly, though, fear does not <span class="italic">always</span> inhibit change. People sometimes manage to effect great change in themselves when they’re scared to death. Some of these changes are purely reactive (brought on by the fear), but some aren’t. Some kinds of learning are enhanced by fear. If that weren’t true, ice climbers and sky divers and oil well firefighters would never be able to learn their skills.</p><p class="calibre_12">When your thirteen-year-old son skateboards up onto a cement park bench and off the other side and turns a flip in midair on the way down, your parental concern may make you ask, “Weren’t you afraid you’d break your neck?” The answer comes back, “Aw, Mom, of course not!” Which means yes. Of course he was afraid. Skateboarding is apparently one of those skills that are best learned with a healthy dollop of fear.</p><p class="calibre_12">Learning, the key activity of meaningful change, is not antithetical to fear. I will go so far as to suggest (in <a href="index_split_136.html#filepos298488">Chapter 26</a> just ahead) that fear is a constant in any kind of essential learning. So if fear is not a fatal deterrent to learning, why is safety so important for change? And what does safety mean anyway, beyond a simple absence of fear?</p><p class="calibre_12">Rather than consider these questions in the abstract, let’s concoct some specifics: Imagine that you are a new hire in a brand-new e-company that has set out to make an electronic marketplace for trading currency futures. If you’ve got your head screwed on right, you have taken this job with trepidation. Neither you nor anyone else really knows what it means to trade currency futures in a newly created electronic market. There are plenty of reasons to doubt your future: Suppose some competitor beats you to the punch; suppose the market is so thin that bid/asked spreads are unworkable; suppose the Mafia slips in to take advantage of a security lapse; suppose regulators impose multimillion-dollar bonds and your company can’t raise the funds; suppose the investors get impatient; suppose the burst traffic is too high for the hardware; suppose a day’s trades are lost due to some kind of failure. Most of all, suppose the company just fails for these or any other reasons and you are out on the street, forty-nine years old and jobless. Erghhh.</p><p class="calibre_12">So you’re afraid. You’d be crazy not to be. Can you make changes in the way you do your day’s work? Of course you can. Companies like this exist on change; they <span class="italic">are</span> change. Everybody in them is scared, but everybody can still change.</p><p class="calibre_12">Paradoxically, the fear of breaking your neck (translation in corporate terms: losing your job) does not make change impossible. It’s a much more insidious kind of fear that interferes with change: the fear of mockery. If you want to make change in your organization utterly <span class="italic">impossible</span>, try mocking people as they struggle with the new, unfamiliar ways you have just urged upon them. There is no surer way to stop essential change dead.</p><p class="calibre_12">The safety that is required for essential change is a sure sense that no one will be mocked, demeaned, or belittled while struggling to achieve renewed mastery.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_121"></div>
