After all, you are under a lot of pressure yourself, so why not pass it down to the people below you on the hierarchy? Similarly, to the extent that you show yourself to be accepting of pressure and able to thrive on it, you’re applying more pressure on your peer managers as well. They can’t let themselves be perceived as less up for the challenge than you are.</p><p class="calibre_12">You apply pressure to your subordinates in a number of different ways, some of them obvious and some not. You do this, for example, by</p><blockquote class="calibre_22"><img src="images/00044.jpg" class="calibre_23"/> Turning the screws on delivery dates (aggressive scheduling)</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_15"><img src="images/00044.jpg" class="calibre_23"/> Loading on extra work</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_15"><img src="images/00044.jpg" class="calibre_23"/> Encouraging overtime</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_15"><img src="images/00044.jpg" class="calibre_23"/> Getting angry when disappointed</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_15"><img src="images/00044.jpg" class="calibre_23"/> Noting one subordinate’s extraordinary effort and praising it in the presence of the others</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_15"><img src="images/00044.jpg" class="calibre_23"/> Being severe about anything other than superb performance</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_15"><img src="images/00044.jpg" class="calibre_23"/> Expecting great things of all your workers</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_15"><img src="images/00044.jpg" class="calibre_23"/> Railing against any apparent waste of time</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_15"><img src="images/00044.jpg" class="calibre_23"/> Setting an example yourself (with the boss laboring so mightily, there is certainly no time for anybody else to goof off)</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_15"><img src="images/00044.jpg" class="calibre_23"/> Creating incentives to encourage desired behavior or results</blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_12">Incentives for knowledge workers are, to my mind, a sad indicator of management that just doesn’t know how to manage. First of all, the incentives are usually dinky: Meet a deadline and everybody on the team gets 5,000 Advantage Miles, redeemable for travel and other goodies. Yawn. It would be different if the prize were a few million bucks to be divided up among the six people who brought the project home ahead of schedule. It’s intriguing to think how that might encourage out-of-the-box thinking to achieve an end. But Advantage Miles? A plaque? A Certificate of Appreciation? Empty honors like Employee of the Month or Team of the Month? Get serious.</p><p class="calibre_12">Such incentives don’t really encourage any kind of different behavior in the people they target. But they do increase pressure by sending a loud and clear message that management wants everybody to get cracking. But wait a minute. How can they increase pressure without changing behavior? Pressure up and behavior unchanged? Is that even possible? It is. That’s my point. Most of the things you do to increase pressure don’t change people’s behavior in any meaningful way.</p><p class="calibre_12">This assertion certainly wouldn’t have passed muster with me during most of my life as a manager, so I hardly expect you to swallow it whole.
