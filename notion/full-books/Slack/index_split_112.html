Meaningful acts of leadership usually cause people to accept some short-term pain (extra cost or effort, delayed gratification) in order to increase the long-term benefit. We need leadership for this, because we all tend to be short-term thinkers.</p><p class="calibre_12">There is no easy formula for real leadership (if there were, we’d see a lot more of it), but it seems clear that the following elements always need to be present:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="calibre_50"> </div><ol class="calibre_51"><li value="1" class="calibre_52"><span class="bold">Clear articulation of a direction</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre_52"><span class="bold">Frank admission of the short-term pain</span></li><li value="3" class="calibre_52"><span class="bold">Follow-up</span></li><li value="4" class="calibre_52"><span class="bold">Follow-up</span></li><li value="5" class="calibre_52"><span class="bold">Follow-up</span></li></ol><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_12">When we’re presented with the first of these and none of the others, it’s not leadership at all. It’s just “leadership,” nothing more than posturing.</p><p class="calibre_12">Since I began with an example of hollow posturing, let me now contrast that to a real act of leadership. The Finnish company Nokia up until the end of the fifties was a successful wood pulp and paper company with a few new acquisitions in low-tech areas such as transmission cable. In 1960, two engineers from Nokia Cable Works formed a grand vision of a new Nokia, one with both feet in high tech and no feet in paper and pulp. The Nokia of today is pretty much what Björn Westerlund and Kurt Wikstedt had envisioned in 1960. How did it happen?</p><p class="calibre_12">If you had been there, you would be able to cite a few early things that mattered: a blueprint developed by Westerlund with the help of a handful of academics and outsiders, formation of an electronics department under Wikstedt to begin implementing items from the blueprint, a diffident but at least tolerant attitude from above. From that point on, though, the picture gets fuzzy. How did everyone get enrolled, particularly executives from the paper side? How was the present truth of Nokia’s identity (as of 1960) used to lead toward the vision of “what we <span class="italic">could be</span> all about”? How did the necessary skills get built? How were investors cajoled into supporting this change of direction?</p><p class="calibre_12">It’s not easy to say how any of these things happened because there was no one single act to enable any one of them. There was instead a broad spectrum of measures at all levels to make sure that everyone got enrolled and stayed enrolled. This kind of leadership is an ambitious <span class="italic">orchestration</span> of direction and encouragement. It became every manager’s business at Nokia from the 1960s on. It still is. In such a context, a manager who is 40 percent used up making operations happen is not viewed as 60 percent reclaimable expense. Rather, he/she is viewed as someone doing leadership 60 percent of the time. If there is an incentive to change this formula, it suggests looking for ways to decrease the time spent running operations to free up more capacity for leading the transformation.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_112"></div>
