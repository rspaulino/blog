The most common flaw of these contracts is an unrealistic price and/or schedule. Buyer and Seller may bind themselves, for example, in a contract calling for delivery of a custom Somethingorother in less time than any Somethingorother has ever been completed before. You may understand why Buyer would enter into such a contract, but what about Seller?</p><p class="calibre_12">In order to understand Seller’s motives, we need to look well below the corporate level to the subordinate organization that will perform the work. Under the gun to show profit and growth (perhaps in a weakening market), this organization is encouraged to best its competition by offering lower price or earlier delivery. Someone within the organization is responsible for getting the work done, for actually building the Somethingorother on time and on budget. He/she tries to say the unpalatable truth that the time and money allocated for the work are plain insufficient. In a Culture of Fear organization, such doubts are stifled or shouted down. “Don’t tell me it can’t be done, goddammit. It <span class="italic">will</span> be done. If you can’t do it, I’ll get somebody competent in here who can.”</p><p class="calibre_12">The person doing the shouting is someone in authority, someone higher up on the org chart. Authority here has more force than reality … for a while. Eventually, reality weighs in, and the result is another fine mess. Time for litigation.</p><p class="calibre_12">Buyer probably initiates litigation in this case, since it has been woefully wronged. It was promised delivery in eleven months and now, thirty-five months and a lot of add-on dollars later, there is still nothing done. Although it hasn’t got a leg to stand on, Seller will probably countersue. In some cases, third parties get sued as well, particularly if either of the litigants is effectively judgment-proof and one of the subcontract suppliers has got deep pockets. The merits of the case will be lost in the confusion of the technology, the awkward wording of a few e-mails, and the ingenious legal tacks taken on all sides. If there isn’t enough there to confuse a judge, one party or the other is sure to insist that the case be heard by a jury.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_85"></div>
