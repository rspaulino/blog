Included among these is what I think of as the Cardinal Rule of Management: I am boss and you are not, so do what I tell you to do. Even managers who are not at all authoritarian benefit from this rule; it’s always there, hanging in the air. For example, if you judge your own manager to be particularly reasonable and disinclined to rely on authority, it’s only because he/she has got some authority not to use. The Cardinal Rule is always at work in management situations … except in change management.</p><p class="calibre_12">When a full-fledged change is in progress, it’s almost impossible to tell the difference between someone who’s diligently trying and failing (normal mode during change) and someone who is rejecting the change. Since <span class="italic">you</span> can’t tell, the people you manage don’t ever have to come to grips with whether they’re failing or just not taking part. The Cardinal Rule is effectively suspended. You can rail against that, but you might better accept it. In the absence of normal authority, you’ll need to rely on your powers of persuasion and your abilities to lead without positional power. Your role is, for the moment, less that of boss and more that of negotiator.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_152"></div>
