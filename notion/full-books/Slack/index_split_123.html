<span class="bold">COMMON FEATURE</span> of the stock market page is the story of a company that has recently turned a corner. They seem to come up with a new one almost every week. A year before, the company seemed to be in full-fledged drift, leaderless and headed for oblivion. And today there is someone clearly in charge, prospects are looking better, and the stock is moving up. What on earth happened in between?</p><p class="calibre_12">Somehow a leader emerged. He/she was hired in from the outside or promoted from within, anointed by a board of directors or retiring CEO (whoever does the anointing at that company), and then … and then what? My answer is that the new potential leader went through some initiative period and came out of that period with widespread trust. Without this gaining of trust, there is no leader, and no real turnaround. But how is trust gained, and how does it ever happen so swiftly?</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_123"></div>
