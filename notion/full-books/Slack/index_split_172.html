I hope this hasn’t given you the sense that efficiency doesn’t matter at all, only that it doesn’t matter <span class="italic">most</span> of all.</p><p class="calibre_12">The fable of the Needle in the Haystack, which follows, is meant to provide a balanced perspective on the subject. It suggests that if efficiency wins you one point in the Grand Scheme of Things, then a bit of slack, plus some inventiveness, ingenuity, risk-taking, and insight into human relations has the potential to win you three.</p><p class="calibre_12">At the beginning of the fable, there is a simple and definite goal. At the end, that goal has been achieved. That sounds good but for one tiny fact: The real goal has changed along the way. Will the protagonist, our hero, be agile enough to pick up on the new (much more exciting) goal and work effectively to achieve it? Don’t count on it.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_172"></div>
