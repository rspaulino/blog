<p class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Quality and Quantity</span></span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_11">If you buy the notion that quality takes time, then it won’t come as any surprise to you that there is an inverse relationship between quality and quantity: The higher the quality, the lower the quantity (for the same expenditure of time and money). There are wonderful situations where this relationship does not apply, but usually it does.</p><p class="calibre_12">This relationship suggests a daring strategy for quality improvement: reduce quantity. Whatever it is that your organization makes, make less of it. Make less and choose much more carefully what it is that you make. The only way you’re going to be able to achieve the Adobe Photoshop kind of quality is to strictly curtail your total of new products undertaken by excluding those that don’t have a prayer of achieving major impact. Make the ones that matter and put all your resources into them. Take the time and spend the money necessary to do them right.</p><p class="calibre_12">Reduce quantity? Gulp. I can practically hear you protesting, “Hey, I’m in favor of quality, that’s for sure, but we have to put out a given quantity of stuff (all of it high quality, of course).” This is a philosophy first articulated by a world-famous efficiency expert:</p><blockquote class="calibre_56">“Quantity has a quality all its own.”<br class="calibre1"/>—Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov (Lenin)</blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_12">In modern-day business terms, the Leninist dictum comes out this way: “We naturally assume that <span class="italic">all</span> the products we decide to make are worth making; the only problem now is to make them all to the highest-quality standard.”</p><p class="calibre_12">That sounds good in the abstract, but in the specific, it seldom stands up to examination. Almost any organization I visit (those that work entirely on products for internal use as well as those that develop directly for market consumption) shows me an array of products that varies from the essential to the inconsequential. Cutting out the inconsequential would be, for most of them, the most important act of quality improvement.</p><p class="calibre_12">The prescription “Make less and choose much more carefully what you make ” is a tough one to swallow. The problem is that the “quality” that quantity has is <span class="italic">power</span>. If you scale back your operation and focus on one or a few great projects, you’re still running a scaled-back operation. You’re less powerful. You may have fewer people, less space, less total visibility. If the product you choose is a winner, the power will come back, but in the interim, you’ve lost.</p><p class="calibre_12">This unfortunate quality/quantity dynamic was at work at Apple Computer under Michael Spindler. The company proliferated products as fast as it could. The consumer was confronted by a baffling array of model numbers and variants. Each one represented a successful little power center within the company. But the company as a whole was going down the tubes. When Steve Jobs arrived back on the scene, he turned the dynamic around and focused all available resources on a much-reduced iMac product set.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_97"></div>
