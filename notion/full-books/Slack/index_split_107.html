This may not sound like a revelation to you, but I frequently come across organizations that frankly admit they can’t change, that they are stuck in stasis, but nonetheless consider growth a normal expectation. It’s a big surprise to them when growth fails to happen. I suspect they treat it as the second of their two big problems: (1) can’t change and (2) can’t grow. They tend to miss that the second is a direct result of the first.</p><p class="calibre_12">Even companies with an acknowledged inability to change—that critical absence of slack—can still talk a good game about <span class="italic">flexibility</span>. They may be in a deep rut and clueless about how to get out of it, but are nonetheless inclined to discuss flexibility as a valuable corporate asset. It’s like money in the bank, they seem to be saying, never mentioning that the current balance in that account is zero. They will tell you gamely about the steps they have instituted to improve the f-objective. These steps often include items I have identified as barriers to change, such as reduced slack, standard process, poured-in-concrete processes and voluminous documentation of everything that will hold still for it.</p><p class="calibre_12">Part Three turns to the subject of making organizational change—and hence growth—possible. This ambitious task involves more than simply removing barriers to change. It also requires vision, leadership, timing, and a lot more. Slack is the lubricant that makes all these things possible. Vision and leadership, in particular, depend on degrees of freedom made available to the potential visionary or leader. Box these gifted people in tightly enough, and none of their magic will be able to happen.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_107"></div>
