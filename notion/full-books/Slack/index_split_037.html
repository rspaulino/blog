Suppose you built an organization that made explicit provision for slack, both time slack and control slack. You’ve tuned it up for responsiveness rather than busyness. Your people have a bit of time on their hands, time when they’re not overwhelmed with work. And you’re not a control freak, which leaves the Eves of your organization free to make some decisions (even some mistakes) of their own. All of that costs you something. How will it pay you back?</p><p class="calibre_12">My short list of the benefits that come with sensibly designed-in slack includes all of the following:</p><blockquote class="calibre_22"><img src="images/00044.jpg" class="calibre_23"/> Flexibility, a capacity for ongoing organizational redesign</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_15"><img src="images/00044.jpg" class="calibre_23"/> Better people retention</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_15"><img src="images/00044.jpg" class="calibre_23"/> A capacity to invest</blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_11">In the short term, these are the secondary benefits. The primary one is better responsiveness. But from the standpoint of an organization’s agility in the face of changing circumstances, these three are essential. In the sections below, I comment on all three, beginning with flexibility.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_37"></div>
