I’ll assume your organization still has one. Now pour in some slack, increase safety, and take steps to break down managerial isolation. Voilà, the formula for middle-of-the-hierarchy reinvention. (Sounds easy until you try to apply it.)</p><p class="calibre_12">In order to understand why each of these elements is necessary and how to make them happen, we need to look into the core activity of reinvention, which is organizational learning, the subject of the next chapter.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_135"></div>
