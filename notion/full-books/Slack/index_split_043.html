Neither of these is usually treated as investment in conventional accounting practice, so even if my use of the i-word is justifiable, it is strictly nonstandard. What most people think of as investment is transfer of cash or liquid assets into some less liquid capital asset that the accountants are comfortable treating as investment. So, for example, your company invests when it uses cash on hand or incurs debt in order to build a new headquarters building. It invests when it buys another company or expands into a new territory or gears up for a new product line.</p><p class="calibre_12">In my terms, you’re investing in yourself when you extend or enlarge your presence in a market that is already partly yours. And you’re investing in someone else when you buy your way into a market where you had no presence before and no inhouse capacity to build one. A few examples: Microsoft was investing in itself when it built Windows-NT; Ford was investing in itself when it acquired Volvo; Beatrice Foods was investing in someone else when it bought Morgan Yachts; IBM was investing in someone else when it bought Lotus.</p><p class="calibre_12">It makes a lot of sense to invest in someone else when you have already saturated or nearly saturated your market. This is something that G.E. and Disney, to take two very successful examples, do all the time. For many large corporations, this kind of outside investment is the special role of the CEO. I’m not knocking it. I am much more concerned, though, when smaller companies invest outside their own product areas. I see this as bankruptcy of inventiveness. It is particularly evident when companies find themselves with extra leverage due to run-up of their stock price. Their willingness to spend this found capital outside their own backyard is a signal that they have no real vision, no idea of how to grow in the arena that they know best.</p><p class="calibre_12">What I call bankruptcy of inventiveness is often the result of a failure to set aside the resources necessary to let invention happen. The principal resource needed for invention is slack. When companies can’t invent, it’s usually because their people are too damn busy.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_43"></div>
