You have to use your authority so sparingly that no one notices that it’s being used. You have to create a real sense that control is not completely centralized in your hands, but spread generously over the whole of your organization. Like a gifted helmsman, who knows that all use of the rudder increases drag and thus holds the vessel back, you have to steer with the lightest possible touch.</p><p class="calibre_12">The slack that you thus cut for Eve and her coworkers is not slack in the time sense. This is control slack. But it is every bit as essential to the healthy organization.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_35"></div>
