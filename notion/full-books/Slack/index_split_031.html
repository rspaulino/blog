<p class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Eve Working for You</span></span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_11">If you are a great manager, then I have a hunch you’ve got one or more Eves working for you. She and those like her are at least part of the reason for your success. These are the people who form the heart and soul of effective organizations. But how on earth do you manage them?</p><p class="calibre_12">Certainly not by pulling rank. You can’t tell Eve to do something because you are the boss and you say it has to be done. You can’t tell her that, because she doesn’t give a hoot for rank. You can’t impose on her goals that don’t make sense to her. If you say, “Get this project done by the end of the day today <span class="italic">and</span> also fill out your Skills Inventory Census, ” she will look at you like you’ve gone bonkers. She’ll do the project, because that seems important to her, and the Skills Inventory will end up in the wastebasket. If you burden her with enough tasks that seem pointless to her, she will soon be gone.</p><p class="calibre_12">Most of all, you can’t structure her work in a way that gives her no opportunity for growth. Growth is essential to Eve, as essential as her paycheck. You can no more expect her to work without meaningful challenge than you could expect her to work without salary.</p><p class="calibre_12">The nearly equal status of challenge and pay is unique to knowledge workers. They are different from the blue-collar workers that our fathers managed a generation ago. The easy, dumb error of managing knowledge workers is to forget that they are different and assume that basic rules developed on factory floors a century ago apply to them.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_31"></div>
