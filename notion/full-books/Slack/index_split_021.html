Dividing Sylvia between two bosses, for example, is only apparent progress, since her improved efficiency is offset by her reduced responsiveness. But if the efficiency expert has only a week to trim the fat … Well, you can understand the temptation.</p><p class="calibre_12">So what’s a useful shortcut for an efficiency expert who needs to show some quick organizational “improvement”? The shortcut that is most frequently employed is to assume that individual workers are entirely <span class="italic">fungible</span>.</p><blockquote class="calibre_30"><span class="bold">fun gi ble</span> (fu j<img src="images/00041.jpg" class="calibre_31"/> b<img src="images/00041.jpg" class="calibre_31"/>l) <span class="italic">adj</span>. (especially of goods) being of such nature or kind as to be freely exchangeable or replaceable, in whole or in part, for another of like nature or kind.</blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_12">Money is fungible, for example. You can take it out of one pile—say, “Maintenance”—and add it to another pile—say, “Groceries”—without any net loss in the transfer. Dollars out of Maintenance equals dollars into Groceries. The Maintenance dollars you transferred are no different from the Groceries dollars that were there already. They all spend the same. Money is fungible … but people aren’t.</p><p class="calibre_12">If you are an efficiency expert under the gun, you can see how appealing it is to assume that people are fungible. That allows you to move people around freely to show an apparent productivity gain in no time at all. (Efficiency experts, after all, have to be efficient.) If a Sylvia can be treated as goods, capable of being divided up and “exchangeable or replaceable, in whole or in part ” with other Sylvia-like workers, then assigning her 43 percent to one department and 57 percent to another makes perfect sense. If she’s not a fungible resource, this makes no sense at all, so (shudder) just don’t worry your little head about that possibility.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_21"></div>
