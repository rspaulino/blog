<p class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">The Paradox of Overstaffing</span></span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_11">Remember that the subject here—the subject of all of Part II—is the effect of stress on organizations. One of the most obvious causes of stress is understaffing. Payrolls are cut, overhead positions combined, and the result is that you’re forever trying to do with nine people what used to be done with eleven. That certainly is a common enough kind of stress.</p><p class="calibre_12">It’s tempting to say that overstressed organizations are <span class="italic">always</span> understaffed; that that’s where all the stress comes from in the first place. It’s tempting, but it isn’t entirely so. There are also situations where overstaffing is the problem, where overstaffing is both the cause of the stress and part of our response to it.</p><p class="calibre_12">To understand this, imagine yourself recently appointed as manager of a brand-new project. The project’s goal is to bring out an entirely new and drastically different version of the company’s backbone product. Of course, there is no way that such a project can be conducted at anything less than a ferocious gallop. No sir. There is a lot at stake here and this project needs to be done yesterday. Well, it can’t be done yesterday, but it <span class="italic">must</span> be done by end of third quarter of next year. You can take upper management’s word for that. In fact, the president himself has gone on record that the product will ship by next September 30. He dropped that at a press conference, and now all the business press has reported it.</p><p class="calibre_12">To your experienced eye, September 30 looks downright impossible. It’s not only an unrealistic schedule, it isn’t even a credible goal. You don’t believe in it and neither does anyone else. So, ever hopeful, you go to your boss for a bit of leeway. You tell her that the September 30 date just isn’t in the cards. “It’s got to be,” she tells you firmly. “We’ll just give you all the people you need to make the date. How many do you need?”</p><p class="calibre_12">“Well, ” you say, “I was thinking of three designers, at least one with interface design expertise, plus one systems guy (an architecture specialist), a test and Q.A. person, and myself. That’s six at the beginning. Then staffing up from May or June to about twenty. But even with that ideal staff …”</p><p class="calibre_12">“Take sixty, ” your boss says. “Sixty today and up to a hundred fifty by year-end. That ought to do it.”</p><p class="calibre_12">And there’s the dilemma. The gauntlet is down. Are you a big-league manager who can run a staff of 60 to 150 people, or are you just another little leaguer who can only manage a teensy-weensy staff? One thing is sure: If you stick to your guns and run the project with an initial half dozen in staff, then missing the date will be blamed entirely on your unwillingness to step up to the challenge.</p><p class="calibre_12">The nature of project work is that whatever it is you’re about to build, the early conceptual phases are crucial. But this kind of conceptual work can’t be done with a crowd of people. A staff of no more than six might make perfect sense while the first-cut design decisions are made. Burdening the project with an extra fifty people at this stage will only make the work go slower. Or worse: With that many people on your budget, your every incentive as manager is to find something (anything!) for them to do. All your available choices here are bad. Anything you assign that many people to do locks you into conceptual decisions that haven’t yet been thought out. You’re forced to partition the whole—this kind of partitioning is the essence of design—along lines that are dictated by personnel-loading considerations rather than design considerations. The result is sure to be a mediocre or poor design, something that will encumber the project from this point on.</p><p class="calibre_12">Look what’s happened here. You’ve ended up staffing the project with so many people that it’s bound to take longer to finish than it would have with a smaller staff. But that doesn’t matter. Meeting the deadline is not what this is all about. What this is about is <span class="italic">looking like you’re trying your damnedest to meet the deadline</span>. In this age of “lean and mean,” it is positively unsafe for you to run the project with a lean (optimal) staff.</p><p class="calibre_12">That’s the kind of craziness that comes from corporate stress and the Culture of Fear. And it gets worse. Read on …</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_80"></div>
