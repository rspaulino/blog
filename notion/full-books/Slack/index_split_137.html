Evolution built this learning facility into us and <span class="italic">didn’t provide a switch</span>. So, for example, when you lay aside your First World War history book in the evening—thinking, “Well, that’s enough learning for one night”—and enter into a conversation with your spouse or your kid, <span class="italic">learning doesn’t stop</span>. It just switches gears. Learning never stops till you’re dead.</p><p class="calibre_12">Organizations, too, are learning all the time. But it doesn’t always take, and not all of it is useful. To become an effective <span class="italic">learning organization</span>, you need to make a habit of learning those particular skills and directions that become the genesis of constructive change. This is considerably less natural. In (maddening) fact, we tend to sop up new knowledge like sponges when the thing we’re learning is largely irrelevant to us, and resist learning things that really matter. This is true for organizations and also true for individuals. You, for example, may have no trouble learning something about a war that happened nearly a hundred years ago, but might find yourself at least partially blocked when it comes to mastering a drastically different way to do your job.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_137"></div>
