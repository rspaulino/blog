Anyone who’s not overworked (sweating, staying late, racing from one task to the next, working Saturdays, unable to squeeze time for even the briefest meeting till two weeks after next) is looked on with suspicion. People with a little idle time on their hands may not even be safe. As one of my friends at Digital Equipment Corporation told me during the company’s darkest days, “There are madmen in the halls, looking for someone to ax.” Of course, the ones they were looking to ax were the folks who weren’t all that busy.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_13"></div>
