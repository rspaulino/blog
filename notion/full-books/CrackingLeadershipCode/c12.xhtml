<blockquote>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0005">I was hired by the communications department of a large pharmaceutical company. On my first day, I arrived in the lobby just before 8:30 a.m., excited to begin my new job. I told the security guard my name and told him I was to meet Melissa, my new boss.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0006">The guard found Melissa's name in the directory and called her desk. No answer. He told me to have a seat and wait. Twenty minutes passed. I started to feel frustrated. I'd been told to be there at 8:30 a.m., and had gotten up extra early to make sure no hiccups could happen during the commute.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0007">At 9:05, a woman entered the waiting area and asked, “Are you Tim?” When I jumped up and said “yes,” she brusquely told me to follow her. I had no idea who this was. She took me to what turned out to be the security office so I could get my ID badge. This took about an hour to finish up. Then, she took me <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="188" id="Page_188" role="doc-pagebreak"/>up to the fifth floor and ushered me into an empty cube. No phone, no computer, just a chair and a desk. She handed me a stack of forms to fill out and an employee handbook. “Someone will be by in a bit to get these from you.”</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0008">At this point, I felt as though I was in a doctor's office. I hate doctor's offices.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0009">An hour later, a guy named Stuart showed up. Stuart told me he works in communications. He told me that Melissa was out of the office this week on a business trip, and she's called and asked Stuart to show me around.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0010">Stuart took me on a walk up and down the rows of cubes. In the next ten minutes, I met at least 20 people. It was like a blur of faces and names going past. I didn't remember anyone's name, and I had no idea what any of them did.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0011">Stuart walked me back to the cube and told me to wait, since IT would be by soon to set me up. I waited until about 12:30. At that point, I'm starving, so I hurried down to the cafeteria to grab something to bring back up so I wouldn't miss IT. Turned out I didn't need to rush. IT didn't show up until after 2 p.m.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0012">Ben, the guy from IT, came by with a used laptop. He was the first person to stop and take a moment to really talk with me. Ben was really nice, but he wasn't the sharpest of IT professionals. He didn't know how to get me logged on to the system.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0013">During Ben's third phone call to the help desk, Stuart stopped by and told me that Melissa would be back on Wednesday. I didn't make it that long. I quit the next day.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0014">Tim's a client of mine. The story of his terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad day is all true. In the span of less than eight hours, his tank of enthusiasm went from overflowing to completely empty. His new position at a stable company with a good salary and benefits didn't matter when stacked against the interactions he had on his first day on the job.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0015">Although Tim's day may be an extreme example, just a couple of these offenses would demoralize most people. Tim saw the writing on the wall and left. What about those people who had a similar onboarding and chose to stay? How does it affect them? And how does it affect how engaged they're willing to be at work?</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0016"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="189" id="Page_189" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Tim's day was not a product of bad luck. It was a product of bad leadership. Melissa completely dropped the ball in ensuring Tim had a great experience. As a result, Tim and the company both lost out.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0017">In this chapter, you're going to learn the ins and outs of experience and why it's important to create great experiences for those you lead. Most important, you'll gain a new set of tools to create great employee experiences in the future.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section><span id="c12-sec-0002"/>&#13;
<h2 id="head-2-68">WHAT IS AN EXPERIENCE?</h2>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0018">Reality, at a human level, is quite subjective. What we perceive as “reality” is the sum of the inputs to our five senses, our reflections on those inputs, and the feelings and thoughts we ascribe to those inputs. When you add all of that up, you're left with your experience of something or someone.</p>&#13;
<p>Experiences are the foundation of every type of human relationship. What we think and how we feel about someone (family members, colleagues, neighbors, etc.) or something (airlines, sports teams, types of soap, etc.) is entirely shaped by the exchange we have with or about that person or thing. Each contact leaves an impression: positive, negative, or neutral. Jan Carlzon, the former CEO of SAS (Scandinavian Airline Systems), called these contacts <i>moments of truth</i>. To give you a sense of the cumulative power of these moments of truth, consider Carlzon's perspective:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0020">Last year each of our ten million customers came in contact with approximately five SAS employees, and this contact lasted an average of 15 seconds each time… These 50 million “moments of truth” are the moments that ultimately determine whether SAS will succeed or fail as a company. They are the moments when we must prove to our customers that SAS is their best alternative.<a href="b02.xhtml#c12-note-0001" id="R_c12-note-0001"><sup>1</sup></a></p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0021">In the customer journey, their overall experience is created by every touchpoint where your company interacts with them. This isn't limited to their exchange with a customer service representative. It's much broader, including aspects such as your online presence, how easy your <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="190" id="Page_190" role="doc-pagebreak"/>website is to navigate, how quickly you respond, the quality of your product or service, and your relationship post-sale.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section><span id="c12-sec-0003"/>&#13;
<h2 id="head-2-69">WHAT DOES CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE HAVE TO DO WITH LEADERSHIP?</h2>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0022">Understanding the customer experience is critical for leaders. Moments of truth aren't just for customers. They happen for employees as well. Think of poor Tim, who opened this chapter.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0023">If the customer experience is the basis for how customers think and feel about a brand, the employee experience is the basis for how your employees think and feel about you.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0024">Today's employees have incredible choices. If an employee can jump ship and head down the street to work for another company for 15% higher base pay and similar benefits, the employee experience becomes a tremendous differentiator of value. The more positive the employee experience, the more likely your employee is going to be dedicated to your organization. Employees who are engaged put in 57% more effort on the job and are 87% less likely to resign than employees who are disengaged.<a href="b02.xhtml#c12-note-0002" id="R_c12-note-0002"><sup>2</sup></a></p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0025">The key to creating a great employee experience is to leverage the power of peak moments. Peak moments are touchpoints where employee expectations are particularly high. If you get these right, you'll build loyalty and commitment. Get them wrong and engagement wanes. Let's begin by looking at what makes for a peak moment and where they exist for the people you lead.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section><span id="c12-sec-0004"/>&#13;
<h2 id="head-2-70">THE POWER OF PEAK MOMENTS</h2>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0026">Think back to the last vacation that you took. If a friend asked you about your trip after you came home, what would you tell them? You wouldn't walk them through everything you did. Instead, you would go through your memory, pick specific moments to share, and edit out the rest. A lot of the boring everyday bits would be left on the cutting room floor.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0027">What you'd wind up sharing are peak moments. Peak moments are those vivid instants that get seared into our brains. They're heightened <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="191" id="Page_191" role="doc-pagebreak"/>reality, life with the dull parts taken out. Memories of peak moments are rich in emotion, sensory detail, and/or surprise.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0028">In life, there are some communal peak moments that everyone experiences. Counting down the last ten seconds until the new year. Waking up to find the money left by the tooth fairy. Heading off to the first day of school. Graduation. As a society, we've created rituals to celebrate peak moments and guide us through times of transition.</p>&#13;
<p>Compared to personal lives, most professionals' lives are shockingly devoid of peak moments. No wonder so much of work seems so…plain. Not investing in these peak moments is a missed leadership opportunity. The employment life cycle is full of natural points at which such moments would be of great benefit:</p><ul id="c12-list-0001">&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0001">Sourcing and recruiting candidates</li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0002">The interview(s)</li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0003">The employment offer</li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0004">Preboarding</li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0005">First day on the job</li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0006">First team meeting</li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0007">Compensation and benefits</li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0008">Initial training</li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0009">Performance coaching and feedback</li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0010">Project kickoffs</li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0011">Continued professional training</li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0012">Mentoring</li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0013">Organizational communication</li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0014">Appreciation, recognition, bonuses</li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0015">Promotion</li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0016">Resignation</li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0017">Termination</li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0018">Retirement</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0030">Each of these junctures represents a window of opportunity to deepen and enrich the employee experience.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0031">Take, for example, Tim's peak moment—the first day on the job. When it comes to a new hire, this is your one chance to make a first impression. Proportionally, it counts for a lot more than just one day. <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="192" id="Page_192" role="doc-pagebreak"/>How that new employee feels about you and the company is formed and solidified in the first full-day encounter. Employees don't walk in the door fully committed. They have their radar up, watching and waiting to see how you show up for them.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0032">Unfortunately, Tim's bad experience is far too common. A bad first day sets the tone for what the days to come would be like. According to a February 2014 survey by Bamboo HR, one-third of approximately 1,000 respondents said they had quit a job within six months of starting it. Of those that quit, more than 16% left within the first week.<a href="b02.xhtml#c12-note-0003" id="R_c12-note-0003"><sup>3</sup></a></p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0033">On the flipside, there are lots of companies that realize creating an incredible first experience can set their new employees on the path to success. One of my clients, a global consulting firm, brings hundreds of new hires from around the United States together for their first week on the job. They stay in a large hotel and spend the next eight days immersed in an intensive simulation to learn basic consulting skills.</p>&#13;
<p>But skill building isn't really why the firm puts this event on. Martin, the North American head of learning, described it to me this way:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0035">By the end of these eight days, we want them to have the most positive experience possible of our firm. We want them to feel that their decision to join up was the best choice they've made in their entire lives. It should feel that good.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>Although a week-long offsite orientation immersion might be nice, it's not required. Google's analytics team pays special attention to which leadership actions have the biggest impact on a new hire. In <i>Work Rules</i>, Laszlo Bock, head of Google's people function, shares a simple email reminder alert that is sent out to managers on the Sunday night before they have a new employee starting the next day. The email tells them to do the following:</p><ul id="c12-list-0002">&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0019">Have a role-and-responsibilities discussion.</li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0020">Match your new hire with a peer buddy.</li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0021">Help your new hire build a social network.</li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0022">Set up onboarding check-ins once a month for your new hire's first six months.</li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0023">Encourage open dialogue.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0037"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="193" id="Page_193" role="doc-pagebreak"/>What Block and his team have found is that sending this reminder alert can reduce the new hire's time to full productivity by a month. This is 25% faster than it would be otherwise.<a href="b02.xhtml#c12-note-0004" id="R_c12-note-0004"><sup>4</sup></a></p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0038">The first day on the job, although important, is but one of many professional milestones. Each one of these markers represents a moment of truth. These are the moments when you must prove to your employees that your company is their best option.</p>&#13;

<h2 id="head-2-71">LEAVE THEM WITH A WOW EXPERIENCE</h2>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0039">The online shoe retailer Zappos knows a thing or two about creating great experiences. Since their founding in 1999, Zappos has grown enormously. From the start, they knew they weren't in the shoe industry. They were in the happy customer industry. Their business was shaped by their core values, the first of which is Deliver WOW Through Service.<a href="b02.xhtml#c12-note-0005" id="R_c12-note-0005"><sup>5</sup></a></p>&#13;
<p>Some of examples of Zappos' WOW in action with their customers:</p><ul id="c12-list-0003">&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0024">Zappos sent flowers to a woman who had ordered six different pairs of shoes, who was recovering from foot pain due to harsh medical treatments.<a href="b02.xhtml#c12-note-0006" id="R_c12-note-0006"><sup>6</sup></a></li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0025">When Zappos ran out of stock, a customer service rep left the call center and traveled to a rival shoe store to get a specific pair of shoes for a customer staying at the Mandalay Bay hotel in Las Vegas.<a href="b02.xhtml#c12-note-0007" id="R_c12-note-0007"><sup>7</sup></a></li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0026">It overnighted a free pair of shoes to a best man who had arrived at a wedding without shoes.<a href="b02.xhtml#c12-note-0008" id="R_c12-note-0008"><sup>8</sup></a></li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0041">Zappos' WOW is not limited to their customers. They also believe employees need a WOW experience—otherwise they can't deliver WOW to customers. As an example, to help ensure there's a good cultural fit, new employees are offered $4,000 to leave the company during their new hire orientation to make sure they really want to be part of the Zappos team. When Amazon acquired Zappos in 2009, they also adopted the Zappos' “Pay to Quit” offer.<a href="b02.xhtml#c12-note-0009" id="R_c12-note-0009"><sup>9</sup></a></p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0042">How do you create an enjoyable experience? In instance after instance, two core themes consistently show up: generating positive <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="194" id="Page_194" role="doc-pagebreak"/>emotions and creating delight. The remainder of this chapter will share multiple tips, tools, and techniques in each of these areas. With these skills and deliberate practice, you can make creating great experiences part of your leadership job description.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section><span id="c12-sec-0006"/>&#13;
<h2 id="head-2-72">MASTERING GREAT EXPERIENCES: GENERATE POSITIVE EMOTION</h2>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0043">Conventional wisdom tells us that business and emotions do not mix. Many organizations operate with an unwritten “check your feelings at the door” policy. The fact is, no one ever checks his or her feelings at the door. What employees do is <i>suppress</i> their feelings at the door. This leaves them feeling like a work-bot, not a human.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0044">Emotions have a huge impact on how we perform. In his book <i>The Happiness Advantage</i>, Shawn Achor cites research showing that happiness improves nearly every business outcome: raising sales by 37%, productivity by 31%, and accuracy on tasks by 19%.<a href="b02.xhtml#c12-note-0010" id="R_c12-note-0010"><sup>10</sup></a> In addition, positive emotions help us to be more innovative. In a positive state of mind, you're more able to generate new ideas and be open to the ideas of others. Some keys to generating positive emotion include modeling positivity, flipping the negative script, and acknowledging and celebrating small wins.</p>&#13;
<section><span id="c12-sec-0007"/>&#13;
<h3 id="head-3-40">Model Positivity</h3>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0045">There's an exercise that I've done many times that's a variation of one that we reviewed in <a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>. You can try it now. Think about a leader in your life whom you've known and worked with personally and whom you especially admire. This could be a teacher, coach, mentor, or manager. What words would you use to describe that leader?</p>&#13;
<p>In all the times I've done this activity, the answers I get back generally include words such as these:</p><ul id="c12-list-0004">&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0027">Dynamic</li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0028">Engaging</li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0029">Enthusiastic</li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0030"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="195" id="Page_195" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Kind</li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0031">Thoughtful</li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0032">Considerate</li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0033">Confident</li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0034">Inspiring</li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0035">Caring</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0047">What do all these words have in common? They're all positive traits.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0048">No one has ever told me, “I had this amazing leader, and you know what I loved about him? He used to get so anxious every time a deadline would approach. I really miss that.”</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0049">If you want to create positivity, be positive. Now, I recognize this sounds like a worn-out cliché. Being positive is easy to do, <i>once</i>. The challenge comes in consistency: How do you show up day after day with a reliably positive attitude?</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0050">To learn how, consider the experience of a professional stage actor. Actors serve as a valuable teaching model because their industry—live theater—specializes in the business of creating compelling experiences. If the experience is dull, the show closes. Professional actors on Broadway perform in their shows eight times a week. Do you think they “feel” like giving a full-out performance night after night, week after week, month after month? Not necessarily.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0051">But what the pros do is find ways to make each performance—whether it's the first or the 301st—fresh. They know that it's their job to be completely present and focused. If you go through the motions without caring, everyone will know.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0052">You may not feel like it, but conveying emotions is part of your job. Take a moment to think about which feelings you're sending out to others. The business world has far too many leaders who can't be bothered. Ultimately, being positive means choosing positivity. The choice is yours to make.</p>&#13;

<h3 id="head-3-41">Flip the Negative Script</h3>&#13;
<p>Julian leads the safety team for a statewide transportation system. In preparation for his annual all-team off-site meeting, I asked him what <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="196" id="Page_196" role="doc-pagebreak"/>were the biggest challenges that got in the way of his team working better together. He said:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0054">We have an epidemic of negativity here. I've got some really smart people on my team, but all they look for is what's wrong. If there are 10 things going on and 9 are working just fine, they'll rip into that one thing that's not working well. You'd think that everything around here is horrible. If that wasn't enough, after meetings, they get into their little cliques and complain about other people and what a problem they are. It brings morale and effectiveness way down.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0055">Julian's team is not unusual. Focusing on what's not working is the brain's default setting. Human brains are wired with a negativity bias. This bias means you have a stronger response to negative information and emotions than positive ones.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0056">From an evolutionary perspective, this negativity bias makes sense. Our wiring gave us a heightened sensitivity to potential threats, allowing us to respond quickly to flee from danger. It literally kept us alive.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0057">Negativity bias is part nature, but also part nurture. Negativity is multiplied by how we're trained to think. For instance, to succeed in your professional life, you've been taught to become a good problem-solver. That means you've honed your skills at identifying what the problem is, analyzing the causes, analyzing potential solutions, and testing out hypotheses to find a worthwhile solution.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0058">These analytical skills are great for solving problems but lousy for creating a positive culture. Analysis is an abstract separation of a whole into its constituent parts to study those parts and how they relate. Positivity springs from synthesis—building bridges and making connections. It's the very opposite of analysis.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0059">Psychologist Barbara Frederickson has done some pioneering research into the science of positive emotions. Her studies have found that positivity “broaden(s) people's attention and thinking, enabling them to draw on higher-level connections and a wider-than-usual range of percepts or ideas.”<a href="b02.xhtml#c12-note-0011" id="R_c12-note-0011"><sup>11</sup></a> In other words, being positive enables people to see more options and possibilities. When you have more options, you can make better choices.</p>&#13;
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="197" id="Page_197" role="doc-pagebreak"/>To create a great experience, you're going to have to flip the script. Instead of always fixing what's wrong, seek out what's right. Next time you have a team meeting (or a one-on-one) try questions like these:</p><ul id="c12-list-0005">&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0036">What energizes our organization and helps it function at its best?</li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0037">What are the things that make future progress possible?</li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0038">What are the most momentous stories in your life?</li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0039">What things are going well in your life?</li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0040">Where am I making a difference?</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0061">By framing questions through the lens of appreciative inquiry, you'll tip the scales toward the positive.</p>&#13;

<h3 id="head-3-42">Acknowledge and Celebrate Small Wins</h3>&#13;
<p>If organizations are suffering through a negativity epidemic, they're also in the middle of a celebration drought. Karen, a senior manager at a technology company, shared a common refrain:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0063">Everyone here is working hard and constantly on the go. We've got a ton of projects going on, and as soon as we finish one thing, it's on to the next one. Stop and celebrate? There's barely enough time to catch my breath. It'd be great to celebrate more. It's just not something we do.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0064">Why don't companies like Karen's celebrate more? I've asked this same question to hundreds of leaders. The typical first response is, “We don't have time.” Consider the belief behind that statement. It harkens back to that industrial age mind-set view of employees. “We don't have time” really is code for “We don't understand small wins are the ideal opportunity to create future motivation and achievement.”</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0065">Celebration doesn't have to involve a big awards banquet, a major outlay of cash, or a full day out of the office. Sometimes the simplest handshake or word of praise will do the trick. Think back to the Israeli semiconductor factory in <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>. Among pizza, cash, or a text message from the boss that read “GOOD JOB!,” the text message was the strongest motivator. Whether you want to celebrate on an individual or <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="198" id="Page_198" role="doc-pagebreak"/>group level, acknowledgment is 90% of the effort required. The rest is just the frosting on the cake.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0066">Without acknowledgment, people's mental energy is stuck in an open loop that yearns to be closed. Not being recognized for one's achievement is demoralizing. After all, if a win happens but no one ever notices it, is it really a win?</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0067">The lack of recognition and celebration of wins is a bigger problem than you might think. Most leaders think they're actually pretty good at this skill. But the research finds otherwise. Studies have found that more than 80% of supervisors claim they frequently express appreciation to their subordinates, whereas less than 20% of the employees report that their supervisors express appreciation more than occasionally.<a href="b02.xhtml#c12-note-0012" id="R_c12-note-0012"><sup>12</sup></a></p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0068">Support for making progress toward meaningful work is the most effective employee motivator. Acknowledging and celebrating wins is a powerful way to offer that support. If you think back on the peak experiences in your life, there's a very good chance that celebrating was part of them. It's key to generating positive emotion.</p>&#13;

<h2 id="head-2-73">MASTERING GREAT EXPERIENCES: CREATING DELIGHT</h2>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0069">The ability to generate positive emotion is an essential leadership skill. Positivity should be the default for every high-performing work environment. Yet, if you want to make the employee experience even more outstanding, you need to master the ability to delight.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0070">Delight is not an abstract concept. It's a feeling—highly subjective and deeply personal. It's the unabashed pleasure that comes when preconceived expectations are exceeded in wonderful ways. It's, to borrow from Zappos, a WOW!</p>&#13;
<p>Some ways you can create delight:</p><ul id="c12-list-0006">&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0041">Start with sizzle</li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0042">Use surprise</li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0043">Create rituals</li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0044">End with a bang</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<section><span id="c12-sec-0011"/>&#13;
<h3 id="head-3-43">Start with Sizzle</h3>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0072"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="199" id="Page_199" role="doc-pagebreak"/>When an experience starts, you have a tiny window of opportunity to grab people's attention. If you don't hook them quickly, you'll lose them. In most business settings, boring is business as usual. The standard for engagement in business settings is quite low. If you try something—anything—you'll stand out from most of your peers.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0073">I was at a conference where Ralph, the CEO of a health-care company, got up to speak. His topic: the need for the company to adopt new technology. Ralph's subject matter—dealing with change—was not a revolutionary topic. I've seen many other leaders present on the same issue. Most of them start off with something like, “The world is changing, and so is our industry. These are the things you need to know. Next slide.” These presentations are doomed from the start.</p>&#13;
<p>Ralph was different. Next to him on stage was a small table with numerous objects:</p><ul id="c12-list-0007">&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0045">A rotary dial phone.</li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0046">An eight-track player.</li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0047">A Commodore 64 computer.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0075">Ralph used his antique props for comic effect. He got the whole crowd laughing about what life would be like if we were still using these tools at work. Ralphed hooked his audience, and they were open to him from there on.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0076">Tools to help you start with sizzle are detailed in the following sections.</p>&#13;
<section><span id="c12-sec-0012"/>&#13;
<h4 id="head-4-14"><i>Use a Relevant Icebreaker Activity</i></h4>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0077">When done well, icebreakers get people moving, interacting, and building relationships. They can relax a potentially formal or tense atmosphere.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0078">However, when executed poorly, icebreakers are cheesy wastes of time. Does anyone really want to listen to a room full of their colleagues go around one at a time and share the name of their first pet? There's nothing like a bad icebreaker to transform a group of willing participants into prisoners.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0079">The first key to leading an effective icebreaker is clarity. The rules need to be easy to understand and follow. People need to be able to <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="200" id="Page_200" role="doc-pagebreak"/>fully engage without confusion. Your directions need to be so precise that there's no possibility for misunderstanding. The best way to get to this standard of precision is to practice. Find a few friends or family and try it out on them first. Don't let showtime be your first dry run.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0080">The second key for an effective icebreaker is relevance. Don't just do an icebreaker for the sake of breaking the ice. Choose an activity with useful subject matter that connects to who you are, why you're there, and what you hope to accomplish. For example, when facilitating workshops on leading change, I often start the workshop by saying, “Follow the instructions on the next slide.” The slide is shown in <a href="#c12-fig-0001" id="R_c12-fig-0001">Figure 12.1</a>.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0081">After they move, we debrief their experience: what happened and what their internal reaction was. Through dialogue, we discover how the activity was an analogy for how people feel and respond to being told to change when that change is sprung on them suddenly. The activity hooks people in a way that just discussing the concepts never could.</p>&#13;

<section><span id="c12-sec-0013"/>&#13;
<h4 id="head-4-15"><i>Poll the Group Using ART</i></h4>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0082">When it comes to sizzle, use technology to your advantage. Audience response technology (ART) is an interactive means for you to create engaging, real-time interaction with your audience. There are hardware, software, and cloud-based systems to choose from.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0083">There are plenty of benefits to using ART. First, ART works at the speed of our instant-gratification culture. In seconds, you can collect and analyze participant feedback to any question that you pose. Because people don't see the results of others until you reveal them, the individual polling process prevents groupthink.</p>&#13;
<figure> <img alt="Image of a slide displaying the instruction to “Move to a different table and seat in the room. Now”, an example of an icebreaker." src="Images/c12f001.png" class="center"/>&#13;
<figcaption>&#13;
<p><span class="figureLabel"><a href="#R_c12-fig-0001" id="c12-fig-0001" role="doc-backlink"><b>Figure 12.1</b></a></span> Example Icebreaker</p></figcaption>&#13;
</figure>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0084"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="201" id="Page_201" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Second, the technology enables you to turn traditional one-way communication into two-way communication. This interactive dialogue builds credibility and trust, because you're showing people that you're interested in what they think. Given the anonymity, people feel safe to answer honestly, and both introverts and extroverts have a chance to be heard.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0085">The key to a successful ART session is to have genuine thought-provoking questions. For example, if you ask, “What's the biggest issue our customers would say we have?” you'll prompt a rich discussion. If you use softball questions such as, “Who's happy to be here? Press 1 for yes, Press 2 for no,” it'll be a failure. Be creative. You can certainly create a mix of lighter fun questions, as well as challenging questions that cut to the heart of your subject.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section><span id="c12-sec-0014"/>&#13;
<h4 id="head-4-16"><i>Ask Them a Question about Themselves, Get Them Talking, Then Listen</i></h4>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0086">Research tells us that people do have a favorite subject to talk about: themselves. Based on your understanding of the audience, craft a compelling question for them to discuss.</p>&#13;
<p>Here are some quality generic questions:</p><ul id="c12-list-0008">&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0048">What's the biggest challenge you face in your role?</li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0049">If you were CEO, what would you change first?</li>&#13;
<li id="c12-li-0050">Who has been your strongest leadership mentor and why?</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0088">You can have people pair up and spend a few minutes interacting, then ask for a few replies, which you will (through clever preparation) use to transition into your next point. Redirecting the communication flow so you do more listening than talking will build rapport. In addition, the interactivity will increase engagement.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section><span id="c12-sec-0015"/>&#13;
<h4 id="head-4-17"><i>Play a Video</i></h4>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0089">Everyone in your audience has grown up watching movies. They are fluent in the language of cinema. Perhaps more than any other medium, movies have the power to make us feel. Moviemakers are experts in their ability to take us on an emotional journey. As a leader, why not leverage what already exists to your advantage?</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0090"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="202" id="Page_202" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Choose a video that's relevant to your message. With the internet, you have boundless options. For example, if you are about to hold a meeting to establish team communication norms, maybe you'd want to show “A Conference Call in Real-Life.”<a href="b02.xhtml#c12-note-0013" id="R_c12-note-0013"><sup>13</sup></a> Here's a tip: let your participants know how long the video will last. Saying “we're going to watch a short video” is vague. Short to you might be 20 minutes. To me it's three. Instead, say, “We're going to watch a video that runs about four and a half minutes.” Then people can settle in for the ride.</p>&#13;

<h3 id="head-3-44">Use Surprise</h3>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0091">There's something wonderful about the experience of being surprised. Sneaky by nature, surprise is an encounter with the unexpected. Not only do surprises grab our attention but also we remember them far longer than everyday events. The novelty of the moment interrupts typical neural firing patterns. The surprise tells our brains: WATCH HERE!!! PAY ATTENTION!!! It epitomizes the <i>peak</i> of a peak experience. Tania Luna and LeeAnn Renninger, authors of the book <i>Surprise</i>, write, “We feel most comfortable when things are certain, but most alive when they're not.”<a href="b02.xhtml#c12-note-0014" id="R_c12-note-0014"><sup>14</sup></a></p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0092">In addition, surprise can change our moods. The momentary shock of a happy surprise can move someone from a current state to a more positive state. This can make that person more open, curious, and receptive to new ideas.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0093">To create surprises, you don't need to be an artistic genius or wait for a flash of inspiration. Because surprises are built on interrupting predictable patterns, all you need to do is to find alternatives to the usual assumptions people would have about a situation. Ask yourself, “What's ordinarily true about this situation?” Then, brainstorm alternatives to how things are usually done.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0094">For example, at large conferences, it's not terribly unusual to kick off the conference with a local marching band. I've seen it done dozens of times. It's fun and high energy, but somewhat predictable.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0095">One client took this marching band idea and turned it into something truly original. I was working as the master of ceremonies for a conference of 350 flight attendants. In the middle of my opening remarks, I was “interrupted” by 10 members of a local percussion ensemble. <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="203" id="Page_203" role="doc-pagebreak"/>However, instead of coming out and playing percussion instruments (predictable), they came out with airline beverage carts and banged on the carts using various tools and implements you'd find on an airplane. The flight attendants loved it.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0096">Another way to surprise people is through humor. Whether it's a great visual, video, or anecdote, humor is built on a setting up a premise (predictable situation) and then taking it to an unexpected conclusion. Advanced tip: rehearse your surprise in advance. In the moment, you want it to go smoothly.</p>&#13;

<h3 id="head-3-45">Create Rituals</h3>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0097">Labor Day weekend is a big deal in my house. Not because it's Labor Day, per se. It's because it's the weekend of the three-county fair in my town. The oldest continuous running fair of its kind in the United States, it's got agricultural exhibitions, displays, competitions, and demonstrations. It's got food booths, amusement park rides, and midway games. My kids (who are currently 14 and 11) have been going since they were born. They love it. Every year there are must-dos at the fair. We always go and see Granny's Racing Pigs. Alex, my son, always gets a moo-nut: a donut filled with soft-serve ice cream. Miranda, my daughter, always wants us to watch the talent show. We end the day with the whole family going up on the Ferris wheel. Whenever I've broached the subject of going away for the whole Labor Day holiday, they've begged and pleaded to stay. For them, the fair is a powerful ritual.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0098">A ritual is a ceremonial act or action set in a precise manner. Performing a ritual is a transformation of sorts. It moves those involved in the ritual out of the mundane, everyday into a heightened version of reality. It creates a peak moment.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0099">For example, consider the ritual of a birthday cake. If you observe the goings-on for most of the party—food, beverages, conversation, and so on—it's a pretty typical social gathering. Now, notice how things change when the cake comes out with the candles lit. There's a quiet focus. Someone begins to sing. Everyone joins in. The song ends. Then there's that lovely pause while the birthday boy or girl makes a wish. The candles get blown out. There's applause. And we return back to our ordinary experience.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0100"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="204" id="Page_204" role="doc-pagebreak"/>A mentor of mine once said, “A ritual is anything that worked that got repeated.” There are all sorts of different types of rituals, and there's nothing stopping you from creating your own rituals with your teams at work. All it takes is your intention.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0101">For example, one small company I worked with had a ritual that, at their monthly all-staff meeting, they'd invite anyone who had joined the company since the last meeting to stand in the middle of the circle of the team. Then, they had to sing a song—any song, of their choosing. After they were done, they'd get a huge round of applause, a certificate with the company's values on it, and a company t-shirt. It was a rite of passage.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0102">If you think about the biggest rituals in life: birthdays, graduations, weddings, baby showers, funerals—they nearly all revolve around transitional moments. Rituals demarcate boundaries. They also support us as we cross thresholds and move from one phase of life to the next. They're a way to honor achievement, change, and growth.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0103">Don't all of those professional transitional moments in the career life cycle deserve to be honored as well? In most organizations, these moments are forgotten. Remembering and ritualizing these moments is a way to re-humanize work. The key to using rituals is to be less concerned with getting them right than doing something at all. Get started. Like family holiday celebrations, rituals will grow and evolve over time.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section><span id="c12-sec-0018"/>&#13;
<h3 id="head-3-46">End with a Bang</h3>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0104">There's a reason that Shakespeare wrote a play titled <i>All's Well That Ends Well:</i> it's true. When you design your experiences, make sure you leave people on a high note. What do you want impress on them? Some things you can do include sharing a story, showing a video, doing some ritual of appreciation or celebration, or showing appropriate humor. Whatever mode you choose, the mood should be positive. You want to be remembered—for the right reasons.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0105">For example, have you seen leaders give presentations that end in a mumbled puddle of apologies? Or refer to handouts that they forgot to bring? Or, maybe instead of an uplifting message, they leave you with a mess of logistics to sort out? In all these cases, the ending sabotages everything that was done before.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0106"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="205" id="Page_205" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Although it's true that you only get one chance to make a first impression, you also only get one chance to make a <i>last</i> impression. And that ending carries extra weight. Psychologists refer to this bias as the <i>peak-end rule</i>, which means you evaluate an overall experience based on how you felt at its peak and at its end. Those moments matter most.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0107">Spend some time really thinking about “What's the final message I want to leave people with?” Then, craft and plan your ending accordingly. For example, when I lead two-day facilitator boot camps, I end with a very specific checkout. I ask everyone to briefly share what they're most proud of having accomplished in the last two days. It's a quick and easy way for the group to connect one last time, generate positivity, and leave on a high note.</p>&#13;

<h2 id="head-2-74">TAILORING A PERSONALIZED EXPERIENCE</h2>&#13;
<p>As an experience creator, you can make work a dynamic place, filled with purpose and meaning. As Pine and Gilmore, authors of <i>The Experience Economy</i>, put it,</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0109">experiences are inherently personal, existing only in the mind of an individual who has been engaged on an emotional, physical, intellectual, or even spiritual level. Thus, no two people can have the same experience.<a href="b02.xhtml#c12-note-0015" id="R_c12-note-0015"><sup>15</sup></a></p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0110">The relationship experience between you and those you lead is deeply personal. When it all goes well, it should be tailored specifically for them. Yet, you don't need to create each new experience from the bottom up. You can mix and match these tools and techniques in new combinations to engage and collaborate at an entirely new level. You're only limited by your imagination.</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0111">When I've shared these tools with leaders in workshops, a common response has been, “This experience creation stuff is all fine and well and good, but I'm already super-busy. I can barely keep up with what I'm doing now. How can I be expected to use these new techniques when my plate is already overflowing?”</p>&#13;
<p id="c12-para-0112">Understood. You can't take on more when you're already full. Being too busy is one of the biggest hindrances to collaboration. To lead smarter, sometimes the best thing you can do is to <i>not</i> do something—to streamline, minimize, or eliminate. We'll explore how. you go about doing this in the next chapter.</p>&#13;
