			<h1 id="_idParaDest-165"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor193"></a>Chapter <a id="_idTextAnchor194"></a>12</em>:  Getting the Arrangement Right</h1>
			<p>It is really hard for an engineer to do a great mix that has a lot of impact on the listener if the arrangement isn&apos;t right. In this chapter, we will discuss what your priorities should be and how to achieve a great arrangement.</p>
			<p>We will discuss the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What really matters in your arrangement?</li>
				<li>Creating a Project Alternative for different arrangements with the same project</li>
				<li>Adding, copying, and deleting sections with the help of locators and Skip Cycle</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-166"><a id="_idTextAnchor195"></a>What really matters in your arrangement?</h1>
			<p>One of the most common issues I see in people&apos;s work, especially less experienced music creators, is the creation of just too many parts that they fall in love with.</p>
			<p>I love to watch movies with commentary from the director. Sometimes they will show you a deleted scene <a id="_idIndexMarker368"></a>and say that it was a great scene and that they hated to lose it, but that it hurt the flow of the movie.</p>
			<p>The same may be true in your arrangement. You may love that brilliant synth part, but if it draws focus away from a part that matters more, or competes with it, you have to be prepared to be a little ruthless and decide that it has to go.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-167"><a id="_idTextAnchor196"></a>Know your genre</h2>
			<p>If you have a song and the most important elements of it are the singer interpreting the lyrics and some lovely piano or acoustic guitar, then you will have one set of criteria. If you are doing an EDM song, your drum machine and synthesizer parts may be the things that your audience will be most interested in.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-168"><a id="_idTextAnchor197"></a>Know your strengths and weaknesses</h2>
			<p>If your song needs a great guitar but you are not a great guitarist, you may have to either hire one or hide your guitar parts in the mix under better-played parts, even though you are the guitarist.</p>
			<p>Again, you have to take your ego out of the decision-making process and do what is best for the song.</p>
			<p>Let&apos;s say that you have a project you are preparing to mix, or have mixed, and you are pretty happy with it but you want to create a shorter, more succinct version. Or maybe you just want to experiment. You want to give yourself a chance to return to its present state, and pressing <strong class="bold">Command + Z</strong> as many times as possible may not get you there. The answer is to create a Project Alternative.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-169"><a id="_idTextAnchor198"></a>Creating a Project Alternative</h1>
			<p>Open the <a href="B16394_12_Final_Apple_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor193"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em><em class="italic">2</em></a> project.</p>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker369"></a>process is very simple:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Navigate to <strong class="bold">File</strong> | <strong class="bold">Project Alternatives</strong> | <strong class="bold">New Al</strong><strong class="bold">ternative</strong>:<div id="_idContainer156" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Figure__12.1_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 12.1: Creating a Project Alternative&#xd;&#xa;" /></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.1: Creating a Project Alternative</p></li>
				<li>Name the <a id="_idIndexMarker370"></a>alternative.</li>
				<li>Here you can see that I have created three Project Alternatives, and the third one is the active one:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer157" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__12.2_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 12.2:  Three Project Alternatives &#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.2:  Three Project Alternatives </p>
			<p>To return to an earlier or later version, all I have to do is select it in the <strong class="bold">Project Alternatives</strong> list, and it will return to the state it was in at that point. If I choose <strong class="bold">Edit Alternatives</strong>, I can <a id="_idIndexMarker371"></a>rename or remove any I choose.</p>
			<p>This is a great way to create different arrangements, all within the same project.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">NOTE</p>
			<p class="callout">Personally, I like to name my alternatives by the date and time, so when I return to an earlier or later one, I know when I last worked on it.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-170"><a id="_idTextAnchor199"></a>Adding a section to your arrangement</h1>
			<p>Setting <strong class="bold">Cycle locators</strong> to define the <a id="_idIndexMarker372"></a>bars that we will be working with <a id="_idIndexMarker373"></a>ensures that we get the results we need for some of the tasks we will now perform.</p>
			<p>If you decide that your arrangement needs an additional section to add to its impact, such as an a cappella intro or a guitar solo, or a drum break, it&apos;s pretty easy to create it.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-171"><a id="_idTextAnchor200"></a>Insert Silence at Locators</h2>
			<p>Let&apos;s suppose that <a id="_idIndexMarker374"></a>somewhere in our project we want to add a four-bar drum break using the first four bars of drums:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create a Cycle for the four bars. The Cycle sets the locators.</li>
				<li>Navigate to the local <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> menu and choose <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> | <strong class="bold">Cut/Insert Time</strong> | <strong class="bold">Insert Silence at</strong><strong class="bold"> Locators</strong>:<div id="_idContainer158" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Figure__12.3_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 12.3:  Insert Silence at Locators&#xd;&#xa;" /></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.3:  Insert Silence at Locators</p></li>
				<li>After this is done, you will see that Logic has created four blank bars at that location:<div id="_idContainer159" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Figure__12.4_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 12.4:  Four blank bars have been inserted&#xd;&#xa;" /></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.4:  Four blank bars have been inserted</p></li>
				<li>Holding <a id="_idIndexMarker375"></a>the <strong class="bold">Command</strong> key to switch to the default <strong class="bold">Marquee Tool</strong>, swipe over the drums for the first four bars. If you press the <strong class="bold">Play</strong> button in <strong class="bold">Transport</strong> or the spacebar, you will now hear those drums:<div id="_idContainer160" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Figure__12.5_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 12.5:  Four-bar drums selection&#xd;&#xa;" /></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.5:  Four-bar drums selection</p></li>
				<li>Hold <strong class="bold">Option</strong> and drag <a id="_idIndexMarker376"></a>them to the desired location. In this case, you may well want to set your <strong class="bold">Snap</strong> to <strong class="bold">Bar-Absolute</strong>, as was discussed in <a href="B16394_04_Final_Apple_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor074"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a><em class="italic">, Edit</em><em class="italic">ing Audio</em>:<p class="callout-heading">Reminder</p><p class="callout">You must release the mouse before the <strong class="bold">Option</strong> key, or you will move the material rather than copying it.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer161" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__12.6_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 12.6:  A four-bar drum break has been created&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.6:  A four-bar drum break has been created</p>
			<p>Let&apos;s explore another <a id="_idIndexMarker377"></a>scenario. I want to repeat an eight-bar section of the song without vocals for a guitar solo.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-172"><a id="_idTextAnchor201"></a>Repeat Section Between Locators</h2>
			<p>Bars 33–41 is the <a id="_idIndexMarker378"></a>material I want to have repeat for a guitar solo before bar 41 kicks in:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create a Cycle for the eight bars to set the locators.</li>
				<li>Navigate to the local <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> menu and choose <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> | <strong class="bold">Cut/Insert Time</strong> | <strong class="bold">Repeat Section Between</strong><strong class="bold"> Locators</strong>.</li>
				<li>Turn off the Cycle by pressing <strong class="bold">C</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Voila, it is done:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer162" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__12.7_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 12.7:  Repeated bars have been inserted&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.7:  Repeated bars have been inserted</p>
			<p>Easy, but I do have one problem I need to fix. It repeated the section with all the regions, including the vocals, which <a id="_idIndexMarker379"></a>I don&apos;t want. All I need to do is select those regions in the vocal tracks and either delete them by pressing the <strong class="bold">Delete</strong> key, or mute them by pressing <strong class="bold">Ctrl + M</strong>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-173"><a id="_idTextAnchor202"></a>Deleting a section of your arrangement</h1>
			<p>Maybe your <a id="_idIndexMarker380"></a>song is a little long for the airplay you hope to get, or a transition from one section to the next is not quite as impactful as it should be. While not all editing in the Tracks area is destructive, it helps to get an idea about what it will sound like without the deleted section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-174"><a id="_idTextAnchor203"></a>Cut Section Between Locators</h2>
			<p>Let&apos;s hear what <a id="_idIndexMarker381"></a>your arrangement would sound like without a section. I am choosing bars 13–21:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create a Cycle for the eight bars to set the locators.</li>
				<li>Hold down the <strong class="bold">Ctrl</strong> key and the mouse on the cycled area in the Bar Ruler and choose <strong class="bold">Swap Left and Right Locators</strong>. This creates a Skip Cycle.</li>
				<li>Press play to start playback a few bars before and note that when you reach bar 13 it immediately jumps to bar 21, skipping those eight bars:<div id="_idContainer163" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Figure__12.8_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 12.8:  A Skip Cycle&#xd;&#xa;" /></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.8:  A Skip Cycle</p><p>If you are happy with what you hear, you can proceed. You might want to create yet another Project Alternative.</p></li>
				<li>Go to <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> | <strong class="bold">Cut/Insert Time</strong> | <strong class="bold">Cut Section Between</strong><strong class="bold"> Locators</strong>.</li>
				<li>Turn off the Cycle by pressing <strong class="bold">C</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>And again, it is <a id="_idIndexMarker382"></a>done. Pretty easy, no? Let&apos;s do some more problem-solving.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-175"><a id="_idTextAnchor204"></a>Consolidating regions and converting MIDI to audio files</h1>
			<p>If you are like me, you may only <a id="_idIndexMarker383"></a>record a small number of audio parts and use a lot of software <a id="_idIndexMarker384"></a>instruments and plugins. Bouncing is just another term for what other applications refer to as rendering. The process creates new audio files. </p>
			<p>Here is why you might want to consider bouncing all the parts to audio files for mixing audio files:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You are collaborating with another musician or engineer, and they don&apos;t own all your third-party software instruments or they are working in another DAW, such as Pro Tools.</li>
				<li>Your computer gets bogged down with CPU demands and RAM usage.</li>
				<li>Many software instruments and plugins do not perform identically every time you play them back.</li>
				<li>When you commit a part to audio, you have fewer things to think about and can concentrate on your mixing.</li>
				<li>Creating a Project Alternative means you can always return to a previous version if you need to.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When time <a id="_idIndexMarker385"></a>permits, this is always my preferred way to get ready for a mix. Others who do a lot of <em class="italic">mix-as-you-go</em> things may not prefer it as it limits them. (I like <a id="_idIndexMarker386"></a>having limits, but I am not the workflow police.)</p>
			<p>In the following screenshot, you see a recent song of mine with some audio and software instruments tracks:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer164" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__12.9_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 12.9: A project with audio and software instrument tracks&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.9: A project with audio and software instrument tracks</p>
			<p>Logic gives you a <a id="_idIndexMarker387"></a>number of options, which we will now take a look at:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer165" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__12.10_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 12.10: Bounce in place options&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.10: Bounce in place options</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-176"><a id="_idTextAnchor205"></a>Bounce Track In Place</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Bounce Track In Place</strong> is great for <a id="_idIndexMarker388"></a>when you want to choose which tracks you want to bounce to a new audio file while not bouncing others. It gives you a wide range of options:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer166" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__12.11_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 12.11: Bounce Track In Place options&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.11: Bounce Track In Place options</p>
			<p>As you can see, you can use the following options:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Create a <a id="_idIndexMarker389"></a>new track or replace the current track.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Include Instrument Multi-Outputs</strong> as part of the audio file or <strong class="bold">As Addition</strong><strong class="bold">al Tracks</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Bypass Effect</strong><strong class="bold"> Plug-ins</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Include Volume/Pan A</strong><strong class="bold">utomation</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Normalize</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There are lots of choices for you to make. I generally prefer to create a new track, bypassing the plugins, so that I can copy plugins from one to another in the Mixer by holding the <strong class="bold">Option</strong> key and dragging them from one channel strip or revisiting them from scratch, to another if I choose to. If you are a <em class="italic">mix-as-you-go</em> person, you may have already done some automation and panning, which we will be discussing at length in <a href="B16394_14_Final_Apple_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor233"><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em></a><em class="italic">, Mixing Your Project in Logic Pro X</em>, and <a href="B16394_15_Final_Apple_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor256"><em class="italic">Chapter 15</em></a><em class="italic">, Automating</em><em class="italic"> Your Mix</em>.</p>
			<p>I <em class="italic">never</em> use <strong class="bold">Normalize</strong>, because when you do, you are no longer bouncing what you are hearing, which makes no sense to me.</p>
			<p>I will generally select <strong class="bold">Include Instrument Multi-Outputs</strong> when using multi-output instruments, as I <a id="_idIndexMarker390"></a>always do for drums, so that I have more control over the sound of each kit piece. I will choose to include them as additional tracks, so that I end up with separate audio files for each kit piece, such as kick, snare, hi-hats, and so on:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer167" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__12.12_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 12.12: Bounce Track In Place with multi-output instruments results&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.12: Bounce Track In Place with multi-output instruments results</p>
			<p>In the Mixer, you see the multi-output drums, while in the Tracks area, you now see the bounced-in-place audio files for each.</p>
			<p>If you select tracks in the track list while holding the <strong class="bold">Shift</strong> key, <strong class="bold">Bounce Track In Place</strong> becomes <strong class="bold">Bounce Tracks In Place</strong>, again with the same choices available.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-177"><a id="_idTextAnchor206"></a>Bounce Regions In Place</h2>
			<p>This is similar to <strong class="bold">Bounce Track In Place</strong>, and you can use it when you want to discretely <a id="_idIndexMarker391"></a>bounce only certain regions or bounce a mix of regions:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer168" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__12.13_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 12.13: Bounce Regions In Place&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.13: Bounce Regions In Place</p>
			<p>This is the method I employ least often, as it just does not accomplish what I generally want to do, which is to have consolidated tracks. But, as they say on the internet, <em class="italic">your mileage</em><em class="italic"> may vary</em>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-178"><a id="_idTextAnchor207"></a>Bounce and Replace All Tracks </h2>
			<p>This does exactly <a id="_idIndexMarker392"></a>what it says; no selecting involved. The downside is that there are fewer options, but it does include separate multi-output instruments as discrete audio files:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer169" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__12.14_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 12.14: Bounce And Replace All Tracks&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.14: Bounce And Replace All Tracks</p>
			<p>This works well when time is a factor, but generally, my favorite is to use <strong class="bold">Bounce Tracks In Place</strong>, because it gives me the most control over the results.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-179"><a id="_idTextAnchor208"></a>Export Tracks and Regions</h2>
			<p>Exporting <a id="_idIndexMarker393"></a>instead of bouncing is an option for when you want to send audio and/or MIDI regions and tracks to another collaborator or engineer or a Final Cut Pro user, or when you want to bring them into a fresh project to work on. It&apos;s also great for archiving to guard against the day that something bad happens to your Logic project:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer170" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__12.15_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 12.15: Export options&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.15: Export options</p>
			<p>When you choose one of the options, such as <strong class="bold">All Tracks as Audio Files</strong>, you now see a range of choices for naming and organizing that far exceeds the bounce options:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer171" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__12.16_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 12.16: Export options with Export All Tracks as Audio Files&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.16: Export options with Export All Tracks as Audio Files</p>
			<p>Wow, that is a lot of options, and many of them are fairly recent additions in Logic Pro. This is just great for <a id="_idIndexMarker394"></a>ending up with audio files that are where you want them, include what you want, and are named and organized how you would like – and you can include them in your project!</p>
			<p>This is my personal favorite, because I like control.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">NOTE</p>
			<p class="callout">When using summing stacks, you need to either expand them by opening them or flatten the stacks first, by pressing <strong class="bold">Shift</strong> + <strong class="bold">Command</strong> + <strong class="bold">U</strong>.</p>
			<p>Rather than creating new audio files in the project, you may prefer to temporarily <em class="italic">freeze</em> tracks to free up CPU demands. In fact, some people may say, <em class="italic">Jay, you saved the best</em><em class="italic"> for last.</em></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-180"><a id="_idTextAnchor209"></a>Freeze tracks</h2>
			<p>To <a id="_idIndexMarker395"></a>use <strong class="bold">Freeze</strong> tracks, first we need to make the option visible. While holding the <strong class="bold">Ctrl</strong> key, press down your mouse in the track header and add <strong class="bold">Freeze</strong> to <strong class="bold">Track Header Components</strong>, and after you do so, you will see the little <em class="italic">snowfla</em><em class="italic">ke</em> button:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer172" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__12.17_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 12.17: Adding the Freeze snowflake to the Track Headers&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.17: Adding the Freeze snowflake to the Track Headers</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Freeze</strong> tracks, a form of offline bouncing, were first developed at a time when most Macs were considerably less robust in terms of CPU power as a way of freezing a track so that the tracks were temporarily converted to 32-bit float audio files, freeing up CPU resources. </p>
			<p>You freeze the tracks by clicking on the snowflake buttons of the tracks you want to freeze and starting playback. While they are in a frozen state, they are not editable, but reversing the process reloads any plugins. </p>
			<p>A lot <a id="_idIndexMarker396"></a>of people still love this feature. So why don&apos;t I?</p>
			<ul>
				<li>For me, freezing and unfreezing was a momentum killer and my present computer is powerful enough that I don&apos;t need to employ it.</li>
				<li>It doesn&apos;t freeze multi-output instruments or summing stacks.</li>
				<li>The 32-bit float files it creates, oddly enough, cannot be imported into another project.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>But you may well love it and choose to make it one of your Track Header component defaults.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-181"><a id="_idTextAnchor210"></a>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we learned how to get our arrangement just the way we want it by adding and deleting sections, consolidating regions and converting MIDI parts to audio files, and employing <strong class="bold">Freeze</strong> tracks while we do so to avoid CPU usage issues.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will learn how to organize our project to make mixing easier with folder stacks, multiple Mixer views, markers, screensets, giant displays of bars/beat<a id="_idTextAnchor211"></a>s, and time.</p>
