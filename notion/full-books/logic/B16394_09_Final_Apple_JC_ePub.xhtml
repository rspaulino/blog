			<h1 id="_idParaDest-138"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor160"></a>Chapter <a id="_idTextAnchor161"></a>9</em>:  Working with Sampler, Quick Sampler, and Auto Sampler</h1>
			<p>Logic Pro was the first digital audio workstation to include its very own software-based sampler, the <strong class="bold">EXS24</strong>, at a time when GigaSampler was really the only other choice. Many of its competitors still don&apos;t include a free one; you have to buy theirs.</p>
			<p>If you used Logic before the 10.5. update, you&apos;ll recognize this:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer125" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__9.1_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 9.1 – EXS24&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.1 – EXS24</p>
			<p>Many users felt that it had gotten a bit long in the tooth, and begged for a more modern and powerful sampler, and in 10.5, they have one.</p>
			<p>It&apos;s simply called <strong class="bold">Sampler</strong>, and as the French say, <em class="italic">vive la d</em><em class="italic">ifference</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer126" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__9.2_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 9.2 – Sampler&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.2 – Sampler</p>
			<p>If you used Logic before 10.5 and are used to loading patches in the EXS24 and are familiar with its architecture, comprising sampler instruments in one folder with the samples in another, you needn&apos;t worry that anything has changed that will not allow you to use your Sampler Instruments. It will all work as expected.</p>
			<p>If, however, you are brand new to Logic Pro, let&apos;s begin by learning how to load instruments into <strong class="bold">Sampler</strong>. Logic Pro X has a trio of new samplers.</p>
			<p>We will specifically be discussing the following in this chapter:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Loading instruments into Sampler</li>
				<li>Working with the Quick Sampler</li>
				<li>Getting familiar with Auto Sampler</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-139"><a id="_idTextAnchor162"></a>Loading instruments into Sampler</h1>
			<p>You can load <a id="_idIndexMarker288"></a>patches that work with Sampler from the Library, just <a id="_idIndexMarker289"></a>as we did in <a href="B16394_05_Final_Apple_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor095"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a><em class="italic">, Recor</em><em class="italic">ding MIDI</em>.</p>
			<p>Because the <strong class="bold">Library</strong> is contextual, if you have a Sampler already instantiated, you will see patches that work with <strong class="bold">Sampler</strong>. As you know, it will load however not only the sampler instrument but also some FX plugins, which you may or may not want.</p>
			<p>If you prefer, hold the mouse down where you see <strong class="bold">Factory Default</strong> on the <strong class="bold">Sampler</strong> interface and scroll down to see <strong class="bold">Factory instruments</strong>, <strong class="bold">GarageBand instruments</strong>, and any third-party libraries you have purchased or instruments you created.</p>
			<p>Scroll down to <strong class="bold">Factory instruments</strong> and load any instrument that interests you.</p>
			<p>Since this a beginner&apos;s book, I am not going to go deep into all the controls that you can use to edit this sound, but notice that we see five panes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Synth</strong> pane contains options for <strong class="bold">global pitch</strong>, <strong class="bold">panning</strong>, <strong class="bold">volume</strong>, and <strong class="bold">filters</strong> for the sound, as you will find in any of the Logic synths.</li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Mod Matrix</strong> pane has modulation routings to affect the sounds.</li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Modulations</strong> pane is where you will find the <strong class="bold">LFO</strong> and envelope modulators for controlling pitch, amplitude, and filters that you can route in the <strong class="bold">Mod Ma</strong><strong class="bold">trix</strong> pane.</li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Mapping</strong> and <strong class="bold">Zone</strong> panes are for creating and editing your own sampler instruments.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These are well covered in the Logic Pro 10.5 instruments guide that is found in the help menu. For now, you can spend some time in each and tweak and hear how it changes the sound.</p>
			<p>Clicking on the right arrow loads the next instrument in the list, while the left arrow loads the previous instrument in the list.</p>
			<p>The updated sampler is very nice, which is all well and good, but the thing that has me excited is its companion, <strong class="bold">Quick Sampler</strong>. Let&apos;s see why!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-140"><a id="_idTextAnchor163"></a>Working with Quick Sampler</h1>
			<p>If you <a id="_idIndexMarker290"></a>again open <strong class="bold">Logic Pro</strong> and choose <strong class="bold">New</strong> from <strong class="bold">Template</strong>, you will see that with 10.5, in <strong class="bold">Project Chooser/Tutorials</strong> is an option for for the <strong class="bold">Quick Sampler</strong> that you may want to spend some time with. </p>
			<p>For now, open a new empty project and in the <strong class="bold">Software Instrument</strong> field, choose <strong class="bold">Quick Sampler</strong>. It looks like this: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer127" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__9.3_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 9.3 – Quick Sampler&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.3 – Quick Sampler</p>
			<p>There are lots <a id="_idIndexMarker291"></a>of ways to bring a sample into the <strong class="bold">Quick Sampler</strong> and work with it. Let&apos;s explore some of the ways.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-141"><a id="_idTextAnchor164"></a>Loading Apple Loops to Quick Sampler</h2>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker292"></a>following steps will show us how to load Apple Loops to Quick Sampler: </p>
			<ol>
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">O</strong> to <a id="_idIndexMarker293"></a>open the <strong class="bold">Loop</strong><strong class="bold"> Browser</strong>. </li>
				<li>Choose the loop pack called <strong class="bold">Di</strong><strong class="bold">sco Funk</strong>. </li>
				<li>From the <strong class="bold">Instrument</strong> tab, select <strong class="bold">All Drums</strong>. I like one called <strong class="bold">Glitter Nights Beat</strong>. It&apos;s <strong class="bold">16 </strong>beats long with 4 bars:<div id="_idContainer128" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Fig._9.4r.jpg" alt="Figure 9.4 – Glitter Nights Beat&#xd;&#xa;" /></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.4 – Glitter Nights Beat</p><p>In <strong class="bold">Quick Sampler</strong>, we have four choices for behavior in the interface: <strong class="bold">Classic</strong>, <strong class="bold">One Shot</strong>, <strong class="bold">Slice</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Recorder</strong>. We will begin with <strong class="bold">Classic</strong>.</p></li>
				<li>Drag the loop into the center of the interface and you have two choices: <strong class="bold">Original</strong> and <strong class="bold">Optimized</strong>. Since this is an Apple Loop, it will already have no blank audio at the beginning and end of it, nor will it need crossfades, so either will work. I recommend getting in the habit of using <strong class="bold">Optimized</strong> (if you drag it to the <strong class="bold">Track Header</strong>, it opens in <strong class="bold">Sl</strong><strong class="bold">ice</strong> mode).</li>
				<li>Play a note on your keyboard and it will play for as long as you continue to hold down the key, regardless of how far it has progressed in playing back the loop </li>
				<li>Play <a id="_idIndexMarker294"></a>different notes on your keyboard, starting with notes below middle C and then moving up past middle C. You will <a id="_idIndexMarker295"></a>hear that the higher the note, the faster it plays. That is probably rarely what you want.</li>
				<li>Under <strong class="bold">Pitch</strong>, you will see that <strong class="bold">Key Tracking</strong> is on. Turn it to off, and now, as the notes you play change, the tempo playback and pitch remain constant. However, if I change the project tempo in the LCD, it isn&apos;t adjusting, and we want it to.</li>
				<li>Right above the <strong class="bold">Amp</strong> section, you will see a flex icon. Click it and <strong class="bold">Follow Tempo</strong> is now on and it follows the project tempo. Next to that is a speed menu, where you have a range of choices to play the loop back at multiples of the project tempo:<div id="_idContainer129" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Figure__9.5_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 9.5 – Key Tracking off with Follow Tempo on&#xd;&#xa;" /></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.5 – Key Tracking off with Follow Tempo on</p></li>
				<li>Switch the tab from <strong class="bold">Classic</strong> to <strong class="bold">One Shot</strong>. Play a note on your keyboard and it plays the entire loop all the way through, even if you don&apos;t hold down the note.<p>At the <a id="_idIndexMarker296"></a>bottom left and right of the waveform, you will see handles that if you drag left and right allow you to resize the loop, and <a id="_idIndexMarker297"></a>under the <strong class="bold">Gear</strong> menu, crop the sample if you wish. At the top left and right of the waveform, you will see handles, which if you drag left and right create fade-ins and fade outs. You can even change <strong class="bold">Playback</strong> from <strong class="bold">Forward</strong> to <strong class="bold">Reverse</strong>.</p></li>
				<li>Switch to <strong class="bold">Slice</strong> mode and now you have a way to play each section of the loop with the slices mapped chromatically. </li>
				<li>If you turn on <strong class="bold">Play To End</strong> and hit a key, it starts to play. But if you play other notes within the instrument&apos;s range, it triggers them and then resumes.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Fantastic! Return to <strong class="bold">One Sho</strong><strong class="bold">t</strong> for now.</p>
			<p>In the bottom section, much like <strong class="bold">Sampler</strong>, you can tweak LFOs, <strong class="bold">Mod Matrix</strong>, <strong class="bold">Pitch</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Filter</strong>, and <a id="_idIndexMarker298"></a>the <strong class="bold">Amp</strong> section as well. Spend some time playing around with these and you will find that it is so powerful and yet so <a id="_idIndexMarker299"></a>simple. I adjusted <strong class="bold">Fine Pitch</strong> a bit higher, chose the <strong class="bold">LP 12dB Sharp</strong> <strong class="bold">Filter</strong> preset, adjusted <strong class="bold">Cutoff</strong> and <strong class="bold">Drive</strong>, and it sounds really different:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer130" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__9.6_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 9.6 – Pitch, Filter, and Amp tweaks&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.6 – Pitch, Filter, and Amp tweaks</p>
			<p>Go into recording mode with <strong class="bold">Quantize</strong> set to <strong class="bold">1/1</strong> in the Inspector&apos;s <strong class="bold">Region Parameter</strong> box and play it 4 times by playing the trigger note once every 4 bars, for a total of 16 bars.</p>
			<p>With it selected, press <strong class="bold">U</strong> to create a cycle. Now, let&apos;s add a bass!</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create another <strong class="bold">Quick Sampler</strong> instrument.</li>
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Loop Browser</strong>, clear the instrument selection and select <strong class="bold">Bass</strong>, still in the <strong class="bold">Disco Funk </strong><strong class="bold">Loop</strong> pack.</li>
				<li>With Logic cycling, find a bass loop that works for you. Let&apos;s choose <strong class="bold">In The Pocket Bass</strong>, but instead of dragging it into the workspace, drag into <strong class="bold">Quick Sampler</strong> <strong class="bold">One Shot</strong> | <strong class="bold">Optimized</strong>.</li>
				<li>When I play it, I <a id="_idIndexMarker300"></a>think it sounds great, but I only want part of the loop, so I adjust the left and right to begin at <strong class="bold">4 3 1</strong> and end at <strong class="bold">11 1 1</strong>. If dragging <a id="_idIndexMarker301"></a>it doesn&apos;t get it perfectly in place, type in those numbers. Don&apos;t worry: you can double-click on each field and type in the numbers:<div id="_idContainer131" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Figure__9.7_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 9.7 – Selecting a part of the sample for cropping&#xd;&#xa;" /></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.7 – Selecting a part of the sample for cropping</p></li>
				<li>Under the <strong class="bold">Action</strong> menu, the gear symbol, crop the sample.<p>Because this is a melodic instrument, I want it to have <strong class="bold">Key Tracking</strong> on. But doesn&apos;t that mean it will get faster if I play a higher starting note? Not to worry, as long as <strong class="bold">Flex-Follow Tempo</strong> is on.</p></li>
				<li>Play in a simple part by playing a note every two bars. I played <strong class="bold">C3</strong> twice, <strong class="bold">Eb3</strong> twice, <strong class="bold">F3</strong> once, <strong class="bold">G3</strong> once, and back to <strong class="bold">C3</strong> twice.</li>
			</ol>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-142"><a id="_idTextAnchor165"></a>Importing existing audio files into Quick Sampler </h2>
			<p>Importing existing <a id="_idIndexMarker302"></a>audio files into <strong class="bold">Quick Sampler</strong> is really easy. To begin with, do the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create another <strong class="bold">Quick Samp</strong><strong class="bold">ler</strong> track.</li>
				<li>Where you see the <strong class="bold">No audio</strong> file loaded, choose <strong class="bold">Load Audio File</strong>, which opens a file selector so that you can navigate to the audio file you want. </li>
				<li>It gives you the choice of <strong class="bold">Original</strong> or <strong class="bold">Optimized</strong>. Unless you know that there is no blank audio at the beginning and/or end of the audio file, I recommend choosing <strong class="bold">Optimized</strong>.</li>
				<li>Alternatively, you can drag and drop it from the <strong class="bold">Finder</strong> into the interface where you see <strong class="bold">Load</strong>, <strong class="bold">record</strong>, or <strong class="bold">drag an audio </strong><strong class="bold">file here</strong>.</li>
				<li>Alternatively, you can press <strong class="bold">F</strong> to open the <strong class="bold">File Browser</strong> and find it and drag it into the same area.</li>
				<li>Once it&apos;s in the <strong class="bold">Quick Sampler</strong>, of course, you have all the same options you had with the other methods.</li>
				<li>All of these <strong class="bold">Quick Sampler</strong> instruments can be saved as <strong class="bold">Quick Sampler</strong> instruments; they are saved with the project if, when you click <strong class="bold">Save As</strong>, you check <strong class="bold">Sampler Audio Data</strong>, and as patches in the <strong class="bold">Library</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Recording into <strong class="bold">Quick Sampler</strong> is another way to bring samples into it, which is a lot of fun.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-143"><a id="_idTextAnchor166"></a>Recording into Quick Sampler</h2>
			<p>You will need a <a id="_idIndexMarker303"></a>microphone for this. If you don&apos;t have one yet, most Macs have a built-in one:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Choose the <strong class="bold">Recorder</strong> pane and practice what you want to record. If your level isn&apos;t hot enough, adjust the <strong class="bold">Threshol</strong><strong class="bold">d</strong> slider. </li>
				<li>Press the <strong class="bold">Record</strong> button, and because this is <strong class="bold">Disco</strong>, I borrowed a play from the <strong class="bold">Sly &amp; The Family Stone</strong> playbook and recorded myself saying &quot;<em class="italic">Hey yeah, shaka-l</em><em class="italic">aka-boom!</em>&quot;</li>
				<li>With Logic playing, I set the quantize to ¼ in the Region inspector so that I get the timing right between the two phrases.</li>
				<li>I go to <strong class="bold">Classic</strong> and <strong class="bold">Coarse</strong> pitch it down a bit to give it a deeper sound. <strong class="bold">Classic</strong> gives me the ability to sometimes play the whole phrase and other times just the <em class="italic">Hey yeah</em> part. And yes, I want <strong class="bold">Key Tracking</strong> on for this.</li>
				<li>Recording <a id="_idIndexMarker304"></a>the part, I play the keys as I like.</li>
				<li>I added some FX, such as <strong class="bold">EQ</strong>, <strong class="bold">Stereo Delay</strong>, and a <strong class="bold">Phaser</strong>, and now I have the following.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Silly, I know, but fun! You can download the <a href="B16394_09_Final_Apple_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor160"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a><strong class="source-inline"> example.mp3</strong> available

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-144"><a id="_idTextAnchor167"></a>Exporting drum slices to create a Drum Machine Designer track</h2>
			<p>Again, this is super simple:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Return <a id="_idIndexMarker305"></a>to the first <strong class="bold">Quick Sampler</strong> where we brought in the <strong class="bold">Disco</strong> drum loop and go to <strong class="bold">Slice</strong> and under <a id="_idIndexMarker306"></a>the <strong class="bold">Action</strong> menu, then select <strong class="bold">Create Drum Machine Desig</strong><strong class="bold">ner track</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Step 2? There is no step 2; that&apos;s all there is to it, and you can save it in the <strong class="bold">Library</strong>.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Quick Sampler</strong> is exactly that, a quick and easy tool for creating your own creative, playable sampler instruments, and it&apos;s my favorite new feature in 10.5.</p>
			<p>Next up is <strong class="bold">Auto Sampler</strong>. <strong class="bold">Auto Sampler</strong> has actually been around for quite a while. It was originally <a id="_idIndexMarker307"></a>created by a company called <strong class="bold">Redmatica</strong>, who made a number of products that worked with the EXS24, Kontakt, and other sample engines. Eventually, however, Apple bought <a id="_idIndexMarker308"></a>them out and hired the lead developer, Andrea Gozzi.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Auto Sampler</strong> became a <a id="_idIndexMarker309"></a>feature of MainStage, Apple&apos;s live performance app for MacOS, iOS, and iPad iOS. Now, with 10.5, we have it in Logic Pro X as well.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-145"><a id="_idTextAnchor168"></a>Getting familiar with Auto Sampler</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Auto Sampler</strong> is a tool to convert patches in hardware keyboards and other software instruments into playable <a id="_idIndexMarker310"></a>sampler instruments in Logic. Have a favorite sound in your Yamaha Motif that you would like to have? How about a sound from a Kontakt library that is resource-demanding?</p>
			<p>Sounds great, and it is. A couple of caveats, though:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It isn&apos;t going to always sound exactly like your hardware synthesizer. Your synthesizer has filters and FX that will not translate to the <strong class="bold">Aut</strong><strong class="bold">o Sampler</strong>.</li>
				<li>If your example Kontakt library has a bunch of different articulations or <em class="italic">true legato</em> (recorded intervals going from one note to the other), <strong class="bold">Auto Sampler</strong> will not capture that because Sampler does not have that capability, at least not at the time of writing this chapter.</li>
				<li>Depending on your choices and how large the instrument is and how fast your Mac is, it can take quite a while.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Still, it is very useful, and I have created several instruments already with it. </p>
			<p>I am going to use an instrument from the <strong class="bold">Kontakt Factory Library</strong>, so as to not annoy any library developers for Kontakt who may not be thrilled by this (it is not illegal, so long as you don&apos;t try to sell your auto-sampled instruments):</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">I will load from <strong class="bold">World</strong> | <strong class="bold">2 Recorders</strong> | <strong class="bold">Hig</strong><strong class="bold">h Whistle</strong>.</li>
				<li>In an Audio FX slot, scroll to <strong class="bold">Utility</strong> and instantiate <strong class="bold">Aut</strong><strong class="bold">o Sampler</strong>.</li>
				<li>If you want your own FX to be part of the auto-sampled instrument, add them to insert slots on the channel strip before the <strong class="bold">Aut</strong><strong class="bold">o Sampler</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>It opens and you see the interface:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer132" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__9.8_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 9.8 – Auto Sampler&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.8 – Auto Sampler</p>
			<p>It&apos;s pretty easy to understand. You set <strong class="bold">Range Start</strong> and <strong class="bold">Range End</strong> to the range of the instrument. In this instrument, it is <strong class="bold">F1</strong> to <strong class="bold">D4</strong>.</p>
			<p>It helps to know something about the instrument. Most developers tell you in their literature how many round robins and velocity layers the instrument has, for instance. The lower the number of <a id="_idIndexMarker311"></a>semitones, the longer it will take but the better reproduction, but not all sampled instruments themselves use a different sample for each semitone. If the developer did not actually use that many samples but looped and re-pitched some the <strong class="bold">Auto Loops</strong> options, this may be something you will want to explore. The sustain time for mallets or drum hits obviously does not need to be as long as a flute because the sound decays faster. So, there is a certain amount of trial and error.</p>
			<p>Once you have made your choices, press <strong class="bold">Sample</strong> and it starts. You may want to turn your speakers down and go grab a snack! </p>
			<p>When it is finished, if you open <strong class="bold">Sampler</strong> and scroll to the presets, you will see that you now have an <strong class="bold">Auto Sampled</strong> folder, where your auto-sampled instruments now reside and you can load them. Of course, you can also save them in the Library.</p>
			<p>A really cool feature is that it also works with <strong class="bold">Summing Stacks</strong>, so if you want to combine two <a id="_idIndexMarker312"></a>violin patches from different libraries into one playable sampler instrument, combine them in a <strong class="bold">Summing Stack</strong>, and load <strong class="bold">Auto Sampler</strong> in the Audio FX slot on the <strong class="bold">Summing Stack</strong>, and away you go!</p>
			<p>There you have it, the powerful new trio of samplers in Logic Pro X 10.5.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-146"><a id="_idTextAnchor169"></a>Summary</h1>
			<p>You have now been introduced to <strong class="bold">Sampler</strong>, which is the revamped version of Logic&apos;s <strong class="bold">EXS24</strong> sampler. You have learned about the power and ease of use of my favorite new feature, <strong class="bold">Quick Sampler</strong>. <strong class="bold">Auto Sampler</strong>, a feature of MainStage that allows you to convert patches from hardware keyboards or other software instruments and their libraries, is now also part of Logic Pro X.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will become familiar with working with <strong class="bold">Live Loops</strong> and its cells and scenes. We will also see how to play cells and scenes live, as well as record and edit <a id="_idTextAnchor170"></a>cells and scenes.</p>
