			<h1 id="_idParaDest-201"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor233"></a><a id="_idTextAnchor234"></a>Chapter 14</em>:  Mixing Your Project in Logic Pro X</h1>
			<p>It has often been said that mixing is as much an art as a science, and I agree. I will not teach you how to mix in this book. No other book will really teach you how to mix either, because it is about training your ears and your mind. What I can do is give you the things you need to consider, and the great tools <strong class="bold">Logic Pro X</strong> provides you with to achieve good mixes.</p>
			<p>We will discuss the following topics in this chapter:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The goals of a mix</li>
				<li>Creating prominence and sonic space with volume and panning</li>
				<li>Dynamics plugins, EQ, modulation plugins, and delays and reverb</li>
				<li>Other considerations</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-202"><a id="_idTextAnchor235"></a>The goals of a mix</h1>
			<p>When we do a mix, we should have <a id="_idIndexMarker430"></a>two goals in mind, and they can seem like they are working at cross purposes, but once you understand why, you will head down the right path:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Hear every sound in your arrangement.</li>
				<li>Make all the parts into a cohesive whole.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you have worked hard on your arrangement to get it to a state where every part that exists in it serves a musical purpose, then of course you want to hear each one, but not at the expense of the mix not all sounding like a, well, mix.</p>
			<p>With a lot of practice and skill, we can achieve both of these goals.</p>
			<p>The methods we will be applying to this are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Using volume and panning</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Effects</strong> (<strong class="bold">F</strong><strong class="bold">X</strong>) plugins</li>
				<li>Sending to FX hosted on <strong class="bold">Auxiliary</strong> (<strong class="bold">aux</strong>) channel strips</li>
				<li>Other considerations</li>
			</ul>
			<p>With Logic Pro X 10.5, we got a very <a id="_idIndexMarker431"></a>nice bonus, a Logic project with the song <em class="italic">Ocean Eyes</em> recorded by Billie Eilish, written and produced by her brother Finneas O&apos;Connell, and it is a great example of an intelligent mix. Finneas has been using Logic Pro since he was 12 years old, back in 2010. I flat out love it.</p>
			<p>You will find it if you open <strong class="bold">Logic Pro</strong> and choose <strong class="bold">New</strong> from <strong class="bold">Template</strong>. Once there, you will see a folder called <strong class="bold">Demo Projects</strong>, and within it, you will see the <strong class="bold">Ocean Eyes</strong> project, which you should choose:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer198" class="IMG---Figure">

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.1 – Ocean Eyes in the Demo Projects folder</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">I recommend that once it is loaded, you immediately save a copy so that you don&apos;t run the risk of saving over it with changes. Then, close this project and open the copy.</p>
			<p>If you are mixing your own song, you will have heard it now tons of times and will be very familiar with it, but unless you have already listened to this <em class="italic">Ocean Eyes</em> recording a bunch of times, do so now so that you are very familiar with it. </p>
			<p>Press <strong class="bold">X</strong> to open the Mixer and you will see the software instruments and FX plugins that were employed:</p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-203"><a id="_idTextAnchor236"></a>Volume</h2>
			<p>It&apos;s pretty obvious that the<a id="_idIndexMarker432"></a> most important elements of this recording are the vocals and, at the beginning, the Drum Machine Designer parts, and sure enough, just looking at the faders shows you that they are indeed being employed at a greater volume than the other parts. There are some changes in the vocal levels over the course of the songs that are accomplished with automation, which we will discuss in <a href="B16394_15_Final_Apple_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor256"><em class="italic">Chapter 15</em></a>, <em class="italic">Automating Your Mix</em>, but not a lot. Because of the dreamy nature of the song, not a lot was necessary.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-204"><a id="_idTextAnchor237"></a>Panning</h2>
			<p>If you grew up or presently live in<a id="_idIndexMarker433"></a> a city where you take the subway, you know that at rush hour, when the car doors open up, it can be really difficult to <a id="_idIndexMarker434"></a>find a seat or even a place to stand holding a pole. If you get on later in the day, it is far easier as it is less crowded.</p>
			<p>The same is true with your mix. If everything is<a id="_idIndexMarker435"></a> mixed right up in the center, it can be difficult to distinguish the parts. Placing the tracks at different positions in the stereo field is called <strong class="bold">panning</strong>, derived from the term <em class="italic">panorama</em>. So, to create sonic space for every track, you want to have some come up in the center, others maybe slightly to the left, with others more drastically to the left, and others maybe slightly to the right, with others more drastically to the right.</p>
			<p>Sure enough, if you open the <strong class="bold">Track Stacks</strong> in the Mixer and look at all the vocals, you can see that they have done precisely that, and if you solo them and listen, you will hear how wide it sounds and <a id="_idIndexMarker436"></a>how every vocal part is clearly distinguishable in the mix:</p>
			<div>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.3 – Panned vocals in the Mixer</p>
			<p>There are not a lot<a id="_idIndexMarker437"></a> of instruments in this production, and the ones that are there <a id="_idIndexMarker438"></a>are trying to achieve this dreamy kind of wash, so not a lot of panning was necessary. However, one instrument is panned hard left and another hard right, to place them alone in a part of the stereo field:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer201" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__14.4_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 14.4 – Panned instruments in the Mixer&#xd;&#xa;" />

			<p>Here is a<a id="_idIndexMarker439"></a> picture of the Mixer in <a id="_idIndexMarker440"></a>one of my songs, with a<a id="_idIndexMarker441"></a> busier arrangement than <em class="italic">Ocean Eyes</em>, and the panning I employed:</p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-205"><a id="_idTextAnchor238"></a>Balance versus panning</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Balance</strong> is different than<a id="_idIndexMarker442"></a> panning. Balance knobs control the volume on the left and right signals. If you own a home stereo, it has a balance knob. As you turn it from left to right or right to left while listening to a stereo recording, any material that <a id="_idIndexMarker443"></a>was panned to one side starts to disappear. You aren&apos;t moving anything, just raising and lowering levels on each side.</p>
			<p>With true stereo panning, it moves the signal&apos;s position in the field, so you move some of the signals to the left or right, while also having the ability to control its width.</p>
			<p>On a mono audio track, the balance is just fine and serves as stereo panning because there is not different material on the left and the right. On a stereo audio file, there usually is, and so you may well want to use stereo panning rather than balance.</p>
			<p>For years, there was an issue with Logic&apos;s pan knob that drove engineers who were more familiar with Pro Tools than Logic Pro crazy. On a stereo audio track, the pan knob was a balance control, so you could not do true stereo panning with it. If you needed or wanted to, you had to open a plugin from the <strong class="bold">Imaging</strong> folder called <strong class="bold">Direction Mixer</strong>. Now, you no longer have to because it is switchable.</p>
			<p>In <em class="italic">Ocean Eyes</em>, there are only mono audio tracks, as is indicated by the fact that you see one circle instead of two on the <strong class="bold">Channel Strip Input</strong> field. If you <strong class="bold">Control</strong> + click the <strong class="bold">Pan</strong> knob on one of the mono channel strips, you will see that it defaults to <strong class="bold">Balance</strong>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer203" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.6 – Balance control with the Pan knob on a mono audio track</p>
			<p>For this song, therefore, it was a non-issue. But if you have a stereo audio track in your song, you may<a id="_idIndexMarker444"></a> want to change it to stereo panning and adjust the position<a id="_idIndexMarker445"></a> and width.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Control</strong> + click the <strong class="bold">Pan</strong> knob and select <strong class="bold">Stereo Pan</strong>, and now it looks like this:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer204" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__14.7_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 14.7 – Stereo Pan with the Pan knob on a stereo audio track&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.7 – Stereo Pan with the Pan knob on a stereo audio track</p>
			<p>For stereo panning:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Drag the knob from left to right, then right to left, and you will see that you are moving it around the <a id="_idIndexMarker446"></a>stereo field, and if you are listening to a stereo file, you will notice that it moves, but does not disappear from the other side as you do. </li>
				<li>Grab the little white<a id="_idIndexMarker447"></a> dots on either end of the green slider and you can widen or narrow the signal.</li>
				<li>You can then grab in the middle of the field you set, and move the left and right positions together, maintaining the same relative panning, but placing the points at different positions in the stereo field.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>That&apos;s stereo panning, and on a stereo audio track, it is almost always the mode that gives you the control you want:</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-206"><a id="_idTextAnchor239"></a>Working with FX plugins</h1>
			<p>There are lots of great FX plugins on the marketplace<a id="_idIndexMarker448"></a> that either emulate hardware or are unique to software. <strong class="bold">Logic Pro X</strong>, however, comes with a really good suite of them, and <em class="italic">Ocean Eyes</em> is proof of this, in my opinion. So, before you reach for your credit card, spend time with Logic Pro X&apos;s plugins.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">I own many third-party plugins, so the screenshots you see in this chapter will not be exactly what you see if you only have the Logic Pro-included FX plug-ins.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-207"><a id="_idTextAnchor240"></a>Plugin categories</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Dynamics processor</strong> plugins control <a id="_idIndexMarker449"></a>level. <strong class="bold">Compressor</strong>, <strong class="bold">Limiter</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Noise Gate</strong> are<a id="_idIndexMarker450"></a> three<a id="_idIndexMarker451"></a> examples of these that we will discuss:</p>

			<p><strong class="bold">EQ</strong> plugins, short for <strong class="bold">Equalizers</strong>, adjust frequencies<a id="_idIndexMarker452"></a> throughout the<a id="_idIndexMarker453"></a> frequency range. They are primarily a problem-solving tool, meant to either boost or attenuate (lower) certain frequencies that either cause problems within the track or between tracks:</p>

			<p><strong class="bold">Modulation</strong> plugins spread <a id="_idIndexMarker454"></a>the sound for effect. <strong class="bold">Chorus</strong>, <strong class="bold">Tremolo</strong>, <strong class="bold">Phaser</strong>, <strong class="bold">Flanger</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Rotor Cabinet</strong> (Leslie<a id="_idIndexMarker455"></a> speakers) are all examples of these:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.11 – Modulation plugins</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Delay</strong> plugins do <a id="_idIndexMarker456"></a>precisely that; they <a id="_idIndexMarker457"></a>delay sending the signal for a time, creating repeating and rhythmic or arrhythmic effects:</p>

			<p><strong class="bold">Reverb</strong> plugins place tracks in<a id="_idIndexMarker458"></a> an ambiance, such as a<a id="_idIndexMarker459"></a> concert hall, nightclub, church, stairway, and so on. They can range from the barely noticeable to the very lush. Usually, we like to use buses to send from individual channel strips to <strong class="bold">Reverb</strong> plugins hosted on auxes, but not always. We will discuss that later in the chapter:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.13 – Reverb plugins</p>
			<p>Logic Pro X comes with over 70 FX plugins. <strong class="bold">Amp Designer</strong> and <strong class="bold">Bass Designer</strong> are especially popular with<a id="_idIndexMarker460"></a> users who do not record their guitars and basses through an amplifier, but we are going to focus on the ones that are used in <em class="italic">O</em><em class="italic">cean Eyes</em>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-208"><a id="_idTextAnchor241"></a>Managing FX plugins</h2>
			<p>You can add, remove, and <a id="_idIndexMarker461"></a>bypass plugins in the Mixer, and even copy one or more from one channel strip to another.</p>
			<p>Let&apos;s go through this together:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create three new mono audio tracks by clicking the <strong class="bold">+</strong> sign at the top of the track list, not record enabled.</li>
				<li>In the Mixer, select the first one of the three, and on the top empty FX slot, hold the mouse down and add any FX plugin you want:<div id="_idContainer211" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Figure__14.14_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 14.14 – Adding an FX plugin to a channel strip&#xd;&#xa;" /></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.14 – Adding an FX plugin to a channel strip</p><p>I loaded a <strong class="bold">Compressor</strong> plugin.</p></li>
				<li>In the slot directly below it, add a second FX plugin:<div id="_idContainer212" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Figure__14.15_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 14.15 – Two FX plugins on a channel strip&#xd;&#xa;" /></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.15 – Two FX plugins on a channel strip</p></li>
				<li>Hold the mouse down<a id="_idIndexMarker462"></a> on the plugin in the center click zone of the first slot and drag it to the second audio channel strip to move it (pressing on the left-side click zone will power it off, and clicking on the right-side click zone will open a plugin selection menu).</li>
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">Command + Z</strong> to undo that.</li>
				<li>While holding down the <strong class="bold">Option</strong> key, again, hold the mouse down on the plugin in the first slot and drag it to the second audio channel, and this time you have copied it.</li>
				<li>Do the same for the plugin on the second slot.</li>
				<li>To remove the second-copied plugin, hold the mouse down on the right-side click zone of the plugin and choose <strong class="bold">N</strong><strong class="bold">o Plug-in</strong>:<div id="_idContainer213" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Fig._14.16r.jpg" alt="Figure 14.16 – Removing an FX plugin on a channel strip&#xd;&#xa;" /></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.16 – Removing an FX plugin on a channel strip</p></li>
				<li>On the left-side click zone of the plugin in the plugin slot, you will see a power button. Click on it, and the plugin turns<a id="_idIndexMarker463"></a> gray and is bypassed. </li>
				<li>To turn it back on, do it again and it is again active.</li>
				<li>To do a bunch of them on a channel strip, start at the top power button and drag down. To turn them back on, do it again and they are back.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>There is a very helpful unassigned key command that I recommend you assign. It will affect as many or as few channel strips as you select in the Mixer:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer214" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__14.17_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 14.17 – The bypass all FX plugins key command&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.17 – The bypass all FX plugins key command</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, at the time of writing this, you cannot toggle them on and off; you must press <strong class="bold">Command + Z</strong> to undo it. I am fairly confident that by the time that you have this book in your hands, that will no longer be true.</p>
			<p>Now that you know how to manage plugins, you can delete the three newly created audio tracks.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-209"><a id="_idTextAnchor242"></a>Problem-solving with EQs</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">EQs</strong> are problem-solving tools. You can <a id="_idIndexMarker464"></a>use them to attenuate frequencies that are not useful because they are mudding up the sound or boost other frequencies that you think help the track pop in the mix a little more, for example. Engineers generally advise people to listen for frequencies that are bothersome and attenuate them, rather than boosting others that you find lacking, but in fact, they do both. However, they recommend the former because you are less likely to do harm with it. When you boost the frequencies, you run the risk of overloading the next plugin in the chain, such as a compressor, which would then be compressing an EQed sound, and it may not sound good.</p>
			<p>There are many different <a id="_idIndexMarker465"></a>kinds, and Logic has emulations of some vintage EQs, such as a Pultec, an API console EQ, and a Neve Console EQ, and they do sound different; but for learning purposes, we will turn to the one that is reserved for a special thumbnail at the top of the channel strip, Logic&apos;s Channel EQ.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-210"><a id="_idTextAnchor243"></a>The Channel EQ</h3>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Channel EQ</strong> is an 8-band Parametric<a id="_idIndexMarker466"></a> EQ with an Analyzer that is extremely helpful for troubleshooting. By default, bands 1 and 8, low-cut and high-cut filters, are turned off. The low-cut band does just that; it cuts very low frequencies while allowing higher frequencies to <em class="italic">pass</em> through. You will sometimes see this band referred to as<a id="_idIndexMarker467"></a> high pass. The high cut, sometimes<a id="_idIndexMarker468"></a> referred to as low pass, does just the opposite. It cuts very high frequencies and allows lower frequencies to pass through:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer215" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__14.18_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 14.18 – The Channel EQ with Analyzer&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.18 – The Channel EQ with Analyzer</p>
			<p>Let&apos;s use EQ to fix a muddy vocal recording:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Go to the <strong class="bold">Verse Vocals</strong> track, <strong class="bold">track 1</strong>, and set it to <strong class="bold">solo</strong>.</li>
				<li>Bypass all the plugins except the Channel EQ.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">EQ</strong> thumbnail in the Inspector.</li>
				<li>Turn on the <strong class="bold">Analyzer</strong> and click on the word <strong class="bold">Post</strong> to change it to <strong class="bold">Pre</strong> and start playback. Now, the <strong class="bold">Analyzer</strong> is showing you the frequencies in the recording before the <strong class="bold">EQ</strong> adjustments you see they have made.</li>
				<li>While it is still playing, click the <a id="_idIndexMarker469"></a>power button in the upper left-hand corner to bypass the plugin, and toggle it on and off to hear the difference.</li>
				<li>Turn the <strong class="bold">Analyzer</strong> back to <strong class="bold">Post</strong>, or turn it off by clicking on the word <strong class="bold">Analyzer</strong>, since it has done its job and consumes some CPU.<p>What the <strong class="bold">Analyzer</strong> showed us is that this vocal was well recorded. There were not a lot of low frequencies where her vocal range doesn&apos;t actually produce sound, so the low-cut filter had little that had to be done. And yet we see that they did in fact do some low cut, boosted some low mids, scooped out a small amount, and then boosted some of the higher frequencies.</p></li>
				<li>Turn off <strong class="bold">solo</strong> and start playback. Notice that the adjustments in the EQ curve work really well, as her voice has clarity in the mix that it does not have without it.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>When you are working on your own tracks, you can grab control points in the EQ and drag them left to right and up and down, and observe, both with your ears and your eyes, how the sound changes. Eventually, you will decide on the frequencies you think you need to attenuate or boost, toggling between soloing and listening in context. It takes a long time and experience to master this, but you want to start trying.</p>
			<p>Alternatively, you may well want to start with a preset.</p>
			<p>Let&apos;s talk a bit about presets. If you ask a professional engineer which EQ they reach for first on a female vocal and which frequencies they generally need to boost or attenuate, the answer will probably be something like &quot;<em class="italic">I don&apos;t use presets. Every mix is d</em><em class="italic">ifferent</em>.&quot;</p>
			<p>The engineer is telling you the truth, sort of. They may not dial in a preset, but <em class="italic">everyone</em> has starting points. It is just that the engineer has them in their head or they have created their own plugin presets because they have a lot of mixing experience.</p>
			<p>You probably do not, so presets<a id="_idIndexMarker470"></a> are a great way to get you started. You will modify them as you listen, but they put you in the ballpark. The bottom line is, presets are your friend for educational purposes.</p>
			<p>In this screenshot, I have opened up a second <strong class="bold">Channel EQ</strong> and loaded the <strong class="bold">Brassy Vocal</strong> preset. As you can see, while the two are not identical, they are pretty close, and if you were mixing a singer that sounds like Billie, you could well start there. Maybe Finneas did:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer216" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__14.19_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 14.19 – Billie&apos;s EQ settings and the Brassy Vocal preset&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.19 – Billie&apos;s EQ settings and the Brassy Vocal preset</p>
			<p>There is a second <strong class="bold">EQ</strong> in the 5th slot, <strong class="bold">Vintage Console EQ</strong>. This is an emulation of the EQ in a famous Neve console. They are prized for their warmth and have been used to record and mix lots of hit records that you know and love. As there are three plugins in between the two EQs, it is possible that the second was employed to clean up a little muddiness that they introduced, but my guess is it was just to add a little mojo to the sound, which to my ears, it does.</p>
			<p>The vocals are really layered in this mix, with two vocal <strong class="bold">Summing Stacks</strong>, named <strong class="bold">Vocal Stack</strong> and <strong class="bold">Vocal Textures</strong>. If you open them up, you will see that there is a <strong class="bold">Channel EQ</strong> with exactly the same settings on every track, which gives it a very homogenized sound. Each <strong class="bold">Summing Stack</strong> also has an <strong class="bold">EQ</strong> on the stack itself, as do all of the instrument tracks.</p>
			<p>I recommend that you spend a lot of time checking out all the EQs so that you can hear how they sound with and without them, and learn which sonic properties they were trying to alter.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-211"><a id="_idTextAnchor244"></a>Controlling dynamics</h2>
			<p>If your volume levels <a id="_idIndexMarker471"></a>vary too much in the range from soft to loud, it can often create problems when you mix, and also affect their prominence in the mix. Logic gives you lots of dynamic processing plugins, and I will explain their differences to you now.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-212"><a id="_idTextAnchor245"></a>Compressors</h3>
			<p>Returning to the <a id="_idIndexMarker472"></a>second slot on <strong class="bold">Verse Vocals</strong>, we find <strong class="bold">C</strong><strong class="bold">ompressor</strong>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer217" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__14.20_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 14.20 – The Logic compressor&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.20 – The Logic compressor</p>
			<p>A <strong class="bold">compressor</strong> does just that; it compresses the signal so that there is less dynamic range, making it more consistent. A <strong class="bold">compressor</strong>, therefore, frequently can be another problem-solving tool for when the singer has not been consistent with their volume level, either because of poor mic technique or just the nature of the song. It evens the level out by reducing the loudest parts. </p>
			<p>In the hardware <a id="_idIndexMarker473"></a>world, there are lots of different kinds of compressors with different properties. Some of the most famous are the Teletronix LA-2A optical compressor; DBA 160 VCA (voltage-controlled amplifier); Universal Audio 1176 FET (filed effect transistor); among others.</p>
			<p>The Logic compressor gives you two flavors of each, vintage and modern, in addition to its own, <strong class="bold">Platinum Digital</strong>. The truth is, in the hardware world, the differences are more obvious, but if you scroll through the different models by pressing the radio buttons at the top center of the interface while playing back, you will hear some differences.</p>
			<p>The key settings are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Threshold</strong>: How loud the signal must be before the compressor kicks in</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Attack</strong> and <strong class="bold">Release</strong>: How fast it kicks in and how quickly it releases</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Ratio</strong>: How squashed the compressed sound gets with the compressed signal</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Knee</strong>: How the compressors transition between non-compressed and compressed signal, usually <em class="italic">so</em><em class="italic">ft</em> or <em class="italic">hard</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong class="bold">Mix</strong> and <strong class="bold">Output</strong> affect how loud the compressed signal is versus the non-compressed signal and how loud the compressor outputs, respectively, while the makeup gain allows you to adjust the compressor so that whether it is in or out, the volume doesn&apos;t change.</p>
			<p>If you look at pictures of the <em class="italic">real thing</em>, you will see that some of them don&apos;t have all those knobs that you see in the Logic version.</p>
			<p>But Logic Pro&apos;s <strong class="bold">Compressor</strong> is not only a problem-solver; it&apos;s a creative tool. If you solo the <strong class="bold">Verse Vocals</strong> track and bypass the compressor while looking at the fader, you will see that Billie did not sing with a wide dynamic range; she was pretty controlled and sang somewhat softly. When you turn it on, though, even though <strong class="bold">Threshold</strong> is set so low that it visually looks like it is hardly getting engaged, the sound is not only louder, it&apos;s more in your face, almost equivalent to someone walking toward a video camera and moving their face closer to the lens. It gives the track more presence and prominence in the mix, even at a lesser volume. This effect is heightened in this track by <strong class="bold">Output Gain</strong> and <strong class="bold">Mix</strong> being cranked up past their default setting. On this track, it makes a huge difference.</p>
			<p>Compression is a<a id="_idIndexMarker474"></a> big factor in almost every contemporary production, and here you see a compressor on almost every track, as well as on the stereo output. When things are louder, we think they sound better, and in this era, music is very compressed.</p>
			<p>As I don&apos;t want to be the guy yelling &quot;<em class="italic">You kids get off my lawn!</em>&quot;, I will say no more.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-213"><a id="_idTextAnchor246"></a>Limiters </h3>
			<p><strong class="bold">Limiter</strong> is similar to <strong class="bold">Compressor</strong>, but essentially, it<a id="_idIndexMarker475"></a> controls signal by drawing a line in the sand and saying <em class="italic">thou shalt go no further</em>. It prevents tracks from going into the red and potentially distorting. There will almost always be a limiter on the stereo output to prevent it from distorting, because as we know, the stereo output is the one channel strip that should never go into the red in a 32-bit float DAW such as Logic Pro. You might want to use it on a track when you want to control the level but don&apos;t want the sound to be more in your face.</p>
			<p>Logic Pro has its basic limiter and also <strong class="bold">Adaptive Limiter</strong>, which rounds and smooths peaks as well as not letting the signal get too loud, and it can be quite lovely, particularly on the stereo output after a compressor, which is how it is used here:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer218" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__14.21_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 14.21 – Adaptive Limiter&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.21 – Adaptive Limiter</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-214"><a id="_idTextAnchor247"></a>Noise Gates</h3>
			<p>Finally, we arrive at <strong class="bold">Noise Gate</strong>, which in this <a id="_idIndexMarker476"></a>production is used on almost all the vocal tracks:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer219" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__14.22_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 14.22 – Noise Gate&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.22 – Noise Gate</p>
			<p>A noise gate&apos;s job is to<a id="_idIndexMarker477"></a> suppress unwanted audible noise, hum, and cross-talk from other sources that can be heard in the silences when the level is quite low. All these background vocals were indeed sung very softly:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create a Cycle for the chorus by <strong class="bold">Shift</strong> + clicking the <strong class="bold">Chorus</strong> marker in the bar ruler.</li>
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">Track 12</strong>, <strong class="bold">Vocal Layer 1</strong>, and open the <strong class="bold">Noise Gate</strong> plugin. Notice that this is in fact a stock <strong class="bold">Logic Noise Gate</strong> preset, called <strong class="bold">Backing V</strong><strong class="bold">ocal Gate</strong>.</li>
				<li>Start playback and you will see that the gate shifts from <strong class="bold">Open</strong> to <strong class="bold">Close</strong>, as needed. Much like in the <strong class="bold">Compressor</strong>, <strong class="bold">Threshold</strong> plays a key role here.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Getting rid of the unwanted noise, especially in a very transparent song such as this, makes for a much cleaner mix.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-215"><a id="_idTextAnchor248"></a>Modulation plugins</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Modulation</strong> plugins are a category<a id="_idIndexMarker478"></a> that includes effects that can add motion, width, or depth to the sound, slightly delaying the signal by<a id="_idIndexMarker479"></a> milliseconds, and using <strong class="bold">Low-Frequency Oscillation</strong> (<strong class="bold">LFO</strong>) to modulate the signal or amount of delay. Logic<a id="_idIndexMarker480"></a> has a good amount of them:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer220" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__14.23_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 14.23 – Modulation plugins&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.23 – Modulation plugins</p>
			<p>They have been used in pop/rock music on almost every instrument, and even on vocals. They have the opposite effect of <strong class="bold">Compressor</strong> in that they make the track seem to sit back in the mix a bit at the same volume.</p>
			<p>For this song, at least, they were not used very much. In fact, the only one I see is an <strong class="bold">Ensemble</strong> plugin on <strong class="bold">Track 29</strong>. But we can get creative here:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">Shift</strong> + select tracks 24–29, press <strong class="bold">Command</strong> + <strong class="bold">D</strong>, and create a <strong class="bold">Summ</strong><strong class="bold">ing Stack</strong>.</li>
				<li>Solo it and <strong class="bold">Shift</strong> + click the <strong class="bold">Chorus</strong> Marker in the Bar Ruler to create a Cycle.</li>
				<li>Add a Chorus, Phaser, Rotor Cabinet, Tremolo, and a Flanger to the <strong class="bold">Summing Stack</strong>, and with all of them bypassed while playing back, listen to each pass through the chorus with one of them made active.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You will probably find the sounds familiar and think of recordings where you have heard the sound of this kind of <strong class="bold">Modulati</strong><strong class="bold">on</strong> effect.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-216"><a id="_idTextAnchor249"></a>Delays </h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Delay</strong> is an audio<a id="_idIndexMarker481"></a> effect that plays back an audio sample again and again after a <a id="_idIndexMarker482"></a>period of time. It can sync with the project tempo or not. There are five kinds included with Logic Pro, ranging from a simple echo to the very complex and amazing <strong class="bold">Delay</strong><strong class="bold"> Designer</strong>.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Delay Designer</strong> is a <em class="italic">multitap</em> delay, meaning <a id="_idIndexMarker483"></a>that it can create up to 26 steps of delay in a single instance, creating some really wild effects. You probably would only turn to it, however, in EDM or <strong class="bold">ambient</strong> music, so it bears no relationship to this song. But if you are into creating music in those genres, you will want to spend more time with it:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer221" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__14.24_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 14.24 – Delay Designer&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.24 – Delay Designer</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Echo</strong> plugin is just that, a simple <a id="_idIndexMarker484"></a>echo, and sometimes it is all you need:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer222" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Fig._14.25r.jpg" alt="Figure 14.25 – The Echo delay&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.25 – The Echo delay</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Sample Delay</strong> is an outlier here, as it is less of an<a id="_idIndexMarker485"></a> effect than a utility, as it can be <a id="_idIndexMarker486"></a>set to delay a channel by single sample amounts. In all candor, I have never used it:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer223" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__14.26_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 14.26 – Sample Delay&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.26 – Sample Delay</p>
			<p>The two you most commonly will use are <strong class="bold">Tape Delay</strong> and <strong class="bold">Ste</strong><strong class="bold">reo Delay</strong>.</p>
			<p>If you have heard the sound of early Rockabilly records from the &apos;50s and &apos;60s by Elvis Presley, Gene Vincent, and others, you are already very familiar with the sound of a tape delay, which was produced with tape recorders by shortening or lengthening a loop of recording tape and adjusting the<a id="_idIndexMarker487"></a> read and write heads:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer224" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__14.27_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 14.27 – Tape Delay&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.27 – Tape Delay</p>
			<p>It is a<a id="_idIndexMarker488"></a> very warm sound<a id="_idIndexMarker489"></a> and still beloved by recording artists. John Lennon of 
<em class="italic">The Beatles</em> loved tape delay and used it on most of his vocals.</p>
			<p>Generally, you will want not to sync it to tempo, but dial in your own rates, and adjust the dry and wet faders to your liking. More feedback means more repeats. I often use a setting such as what you see in the preceding screenshot on my own vocals.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Stereo Delay</strong> is the one used in this<a id="_idIndexMarker490"></a> production, again on a ton of tracks. It is a software version of a digital delay, such as the iconic Lexicons and TC Electronic delays, and is perhaps the most versatile:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer225" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__14.28_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 14.28 – Stereo Delay&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.28 – Stereo Delay</p>
			<p>Here, you can see the<a id="_idIndexMarker491"></a> settings on the lead vocal, and as you can see, it is tempo-synced with very little output, which makes it quite subtle:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Solo the track and bypass it, and then make it active, repeatedly; you will hear that it adds some depth to the sound and is really lovely.</li>
				<li>Solo all the vocals and play back the chorus, and again you will hear a lovely sort of homogenized sound.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>If you open multiple <strong class="bold">Stereo Delay</strong> instances from the tracks, you will see that they have identical settings, which leads to that homogenized effect.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-217"><a id="_idTextAnchor250"></a>Reverbs</h2>
			<p>What is reverb? If you<a id="_idIndexMarker492"></a> walk into a big church with high ceilings<a id="_idIndexMarker493"></a> and clap your hands loudly, what you hear reflected back is <strong class="bold">reverb</strong>. When you walk into a stairwell and do the same, that is also reverb. A <strong class="bold">Reverb</strong> plugins are an<a id="_idIndexMarker494"></a> ambiance generator and can be used to place the sound as if it were in a concert hall, night club, scoring stage, or outdoor venue, among others.</p>
			<p>Early reverberation was created with echo chambers, plates, springs, and other mechanical devices and are still used today. Later, there were digital reverbs by Lexicon, Eventide, and others that used mathematical algorithms to recreate those ambiances and the aforementioned venue types.</p>
			<p>With plugins, there are essentially two types:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Algorithmic</strong>: Generally <a id="_idIndexMarker495"></a>speaking, algorithmic reverbs are more of an effect rather than an accurate recreation of a specific location. They are prized for their ability to add sheen and gloss to a sound, as well as some special chorusing that some, such as the famous Lexicons, add.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Convolution</strong>: Convolution <a id="_idIndexMarker496"></a>reverbs use samples, in <strong class="bold">Impulse Responses</strong> (<strong class="bold">IRs</strong>). People who <a id="_idIndexMarker497"></a>create IRs go to the venues and record the ambiance with microphones. So, a well-recorded IR will be a more accurate recreation of a specific venue rather than an algorithmic reverb.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Logic comes with three of the former and one of the latter. <strong class="bold">Enverb</strong> and <strong class="bold">SilverVerb</strong> are older Logic algorithmic<a id="_idIndexMarker498"></a> reverbs. I rarely see <strong class="bold">Enverb</strong> used much anymore, but <strong class="bold">SilverVerb</strong> still gets used <a id="_idIndexMarker499"></a>a lot on percussion and drums, because it is simple, sounds great on short sounds, and is very light on the CPU. It is generally used directly on 
a channel strip, as it is in this song on three channel strips:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer226" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.29 – SilverVerb</p>
			<p>Logic Pro&apos;s newest <a id="_idIndexMarker500"></a>algorithmic reverb is called <strong class="bold">ChromaVerb</strong>, and I think it sounds great. It gives you a lot of control <a id="_idIndexMarker501"></a>over its pre-delay before it kicks in, as well as size, density, and other settings, and it has a built-in EQ for taking out any perceived muddiness. It also has that gloss and sheen when you need it. Apparently, though, in this p<a id="_idTextAnchor251"></a><a id="_idTextAnchor252"></a>roject, it was not the reverb of choice:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer227" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.30 – ChromaVerb</p>
			<p>Logic Pro&apos;s <a id="_idIndexMarker502"></a>convolution reverb is called <strong class="bold">Space Designer</strong>, and it also sounds great, with tremendous control:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer228" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.31 – Space Designer</p>
			<p>There are five of<a id="_idIndexMarker503"></a> them used in this <a id="_idIndexMarker504"></a>project, all instantiated on auxes, all assigned to buses that send to them, as is done with hardware units plugged into recording consoles.</p>
			<p>In the hardware world, the reasons to bus to them were obvious. The great ones were/are darned expensive, so there were only so many you had available. In the software world, we mostly do it to save CPU, resources but also, it gives you a more subtle level of control than when they are opened directly on a channel strip. Frequently, you also want to give the impression that the performers were in the same place or places, although not always.</p>
			<p>Logic makes the creation of auxes with buses super easy. Let&apos;s see how it is done.</p>
			<p>Open the <a href="B16394_14_Final_Apple_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor233"><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em></a> Logic project:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.32 – A little project with vocals</p>
			<p>Here, I have four vocal tracks that I want to <a id="_idIndexMarker505"></a>send to two reverbs, <strong class="bold">ChromaVerb</strong> and <strong class="bold">Space Designer</strong>, for a hybrid reverb effect:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">Shift</strong> + select the four tracks and hold down on <strong class="bold">Send</strong>, and select an unused bus.<p>As you can see in the following screenshot, Logic automatically created an aux with that chosen bus as its input:</p><div id="_idContainer230" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Figure__14.33_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 14.33 – Aux with a bus input assignment&#xd;&#xa;" /></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.33 – Aux with a bus input assignment</p></li>
				<li>Repeat the process and another aux is created with the correct bus input.</li>
				<li>Instantiate a <strong class="bold">ChromaVerb</strong> reverb with a preset on <strong class="bold">Aux 1</strong>, and a <strong class="bold">Space Designer</strong> reverb with a<a id="_idIndexMarker506"></a> preset on <strong class="bold">Aux 2</strong>.</li>
				<li>Press play and listen to that gorgeous reverb:<div id="_idContainer231" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Figure__14.34_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 14.34 – Reverbs on auxes&#xd;&#xa;" /></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.34 – Reverbs on auxes</p><p>You don&apos;t hear it? No, you don&apos;t, because <a id="_idIndexMarker507"></a>you control the amount you hear by sending from the tracks.</p></li>
				<li>With all the vocal channel strips in the Mixer selected, press play and turn the <strong class="bold">Bus 1</strong> send knob slowly to the right, and now you will start to hear the <strong class="bold">ChromaVe</strong><strong class="bold">rb</strong> reverb.</li>
				<li>With all the vocal channel strips in the Mixer selected, press play and turn the <strong class="bold">Bus 2</strong> send knob slowly to the right, and now you start to hear the <strong class="bold">Space Design</strong><strong class="bold">er</strong> reverb.</li>
				<li>Clicking on the power button on either to bypass it allows you to hear one or the other in isolation:</li>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-218"><a id="_idTextAnchor253"></a>Mixing as you go versus starting from scratch</h1>
			<p>Here is where we come to a very <a id="_idIndexMarker508"></a>subjective topic. I will give you my views, but others will disagree, and they are not necessarily right or wrong.</p>
			<p>I started at a time when the common practice was for an engineer to set levels for players while they were tracking their parts, and then when it came time to mix, the engineer would pull all the faders down and start from scratch, by balancing and panning the drums, or maybe the vocals.</p>
			<p>People working with samples and software instruments mostly mix as they go, and I do too. </p>
			<p>When time permits, however, I prefer to do the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Create a new Project Alternative.</li>
				<li>Bounce and replace all my software instrument tracks so that now I am only dealing with audio.</li>
				<li>Pull down the faders and start from scratch.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Why do I prefer doing this? Well, because I am a composer who learned to mix, rather than an engineer who learned to compose, I think differently. This way, I am no longer worrying about the MIDI performances<a id="_idIndexMarker509"></a> or choices; I am solely focused on making the parts work together. Also, software instruments can sometimes get finicky, especially resource-demanding third-party ones, and their performance can be erratic. They also put more burden on your CPU, which audio does not.</p>
			<p>In the end, though, you will eventually <a id="_idIndexMarker510"></a>discover what works best for you and decide.</p>
			<p>I also like to turn on <strong class="bold">Pre Fader Metering</strong>. Here is how you do so:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Customize your control bar and make sure that <strong class="bold">Pre Fader Metering</strong> is checked in the <strong class="bold">Modes and Functions</strong> section, and click <strong class="bold">OK</strong>:<div id="_idContainer233" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Figure__14.36_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 14.36 – Pre Fader Metering selected&#xd;&#xa;" /></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.36 – Pre Fader Metering selected</p></li>
				<li>Click the <strong class="bold">Pre Fader Metering</strong> button to turn it on:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer234" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__14.37_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 14.37 – Pre Fader Metering engaged&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.37 – Pre Fader Metering engaged</p>
			<p>What happens with pre-fader<a id="_idIndexMarker511"></a> metering is that as you adjust the volume up or down on your channel strip, even though you hear the sound louder or softer, the level you see displayed on the channel strip does not change. It shows you the amount of signal that the <a id="_idIndexMarker512"></a>channel strip is receiving. When you have multiple plugins flowing from one into another, sometimes if one is outputting a hot signal, the one following it does not handle it well and the sound, while not actually digitally distorting, may not sound good. This is especially true when you start using third-party FX. So, if something sounds off, while it may not be the channel strip that is going wildly into the red, it&apos;s as good a place to start troubleshooting as any.</p>
			<p>The other advantage is that we should be mixing with our ears more than our eyes. I like to turn a fader all the way down, then gradually raise the level, sometimes with my eyes closed, until it sounds right to me.</p>
			<p>Some users I know never use pre-fader, only post-fader. Others only use pre-fader. Most engineers that I know go back and forth between the two, at different stages of the mix.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-219"><a id="_idTextAnchor254"></a>Other considerations</h1>
			<p>Here are some<a id="_idIndexMarker513"></a> final thoughts I will share with you about mixing. As promised, I did not teach you to mix because I can&apos;t. It takes a lot of practice.</p>
			<p>A mix will always sound somewhat different on different playback systems, but the intention is to create one that sounds good on as many as is possible, which is often referred to as how a mix <em class="italic">t</em><em class="italic">ranslates</em>.</p>
			<p>The following factors will affect your ability to create a mix that you know will sound good on other systems:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your room.</li>
				<li>Your studio monitors (speakers, not computer displays).</li>
				<li>Your other playback options.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you do not have a room that has been acoustically treated, and most of us don&apos;t, bass frequencies can get trapped, so you don&apos;t get an accurate bass level for translation. There are a<a id="_idIndexMarker514"></a> number of solutions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Buy some acoustic panels and set them up. There are a lot of tutorials on how to do this on the internet.</li>
				<li>Buy room correction software that is designed to help with this. There are several and opinions vary wildly as to how well they work.</li>
				<li>Buy studio monitors with built-in room correction software that is designed to help with this. Again, there is some disagreement, but I think that some companies get it right. There are lots of reviews online.</li>
				<li>Put up bookcases, staggering different-sized books, so that the frequencies are less likely to get trapped.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>At the end of the day, though, it will come down to how well you know how your monitors help you translate in your specific room. In my case, because I have a three-way speaker system with a subwoofer in an untreated room, I know that if I find myself wanting just a little more bass, it will translate well, whereas if the bass is exactly at the level I like it, it will be a bit bass-heavy on other systems.</p>
			<p>I recommend that you listen to your mix on as many different playback systems as possible. I listen through headphones, burn the mix onto a CD, and play it back on a boombox and in the CD player in my car.</p>
			<p>I also suggest you bring commercial mixes of projects that are in a similar genre and compare it to your mix; although they will be mastered, so yours will not sound as loud or as good. We will discuss mastering in <a href="B16394_16_Final_Apple_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor279"><em class="italic">Chapter 16</em></a>, <em class="italic">Delivering Your Music for Dist</em><em class="italic">ribution</em>. </p>
			<p>When you are mixing, listen at different volumes. Mixing only at full volume can make you think your mix sounds better than it does. Take frequent breaks to prevent your ears from having mix fatigue.</p>
			<p>Obviously, if you can sit in on a mixing session with an experienced engineer and listen and observe what they do, it can be very informative. </p>
			<p>There are lots of videos<a id="_idIndexMarker515"></a> about mixing available online, some paid, some free, some with very famous engineers. They too can be helpful, but keep in mind that they are usually created to either generate income for the engineer or to encourage you to buy third-party plugins.</p>
			<p>It will take a fair amount of time and practice to be able to achieve a good mix, but it is a realistic goal for you.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-220"><a id="_idTextAnchor255"></a>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we covered the goals of a mix, and how to achieve them using volume, panning, and different kinds of FX plugins. I also gave you some advice on what to expect from your mixing environment, and how to listen to your finished mix to evaluate it.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will become familiar with how to use automation, both offline and with the project playing back, to bring liveliness and movement to your mixes.</p>
