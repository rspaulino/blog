			<h1 id="_idParaDest-147"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor171"></a>Chapter <a id="_idTextAnchor172"></a>1</em><em class="italic">0</em>:  Working with Live Loops</h1>
			<p>All of the major digital audio workstations err…<em class="italic">borrow</em> from each other. 10.5&apos;s new <strong class="bold">Live Loops</strong> feature clearly owes a debt to Ableton Live. <strong class="bold">Live Loops</strong> is a way to create music in a non-linear fashion, organizing cells in a grid. If you are familiar with Ableton Live, then you already know about the concept of composing by triggering cells and scenes.</p>
			<p>Specifically, this chapter covers the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Starter Grids</li>
				<li>Understanding Cells and Scenes</li>
				<li>Editing cells</li>
				<li>Creating scenes from cells</li>
				<li>Playing cells and scenes live</li>
				<li>Recording cells and scenes into the Tracks area</li>
				<li>The new Remix FX multi-effects plugin</li>
			</ul>
			<p>As with the other new features, 10.5 includes a tutorial for <strong class="bold">Live Loops</strong> that you may well want to spend some time with. For now, though, let&apos;s begin by employing one of the many starter grids that are provided for you.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-148"><a id="_idTextAnchor173"></a>Understanding Cells and Scenes with a Starter grid</h1>
			<p>Open <strong class="bold">Logic Pro X</strong> and <a id="_idIndexMarker313"></a>choose <strong class="bold">New</strong> from <strong class="bold">Template</strong>, and you will see 17 starter grids. You can choose any one you like, but I am beginning with the starter grid named <strong class="bold">Eleva</strong><strong class="bold">ted Beats</strong>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer134" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__10.1_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 10.1 – The Elevated Beats starter grid&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.1 – The Elevated Beats starter grid</p>
			<p>Well, this looks like nothing I have ever seen in previous versions of Logic, and when it was leaked on social media, I made a fool of myself by saying that I thought it was created in Photoshop! </p>
			<p>Here, you can see six tracks in the track list. Each track has 12 colored cells that are organized into 12 scenes, which <a id="_idIndexMarker314"></a>are horizontal columns of cells that can be triggered together. The numbered scene trigger buttons are at the bottom of the grid. In the preceding screenshot, below them, you can see the <strong class="bold">Smart Controls</strong>, with a new group of plugins named <strong class="bold">Remix FX</strong>.</p>
			<p>Sometimes, the best way to learn about something is to just try it. Let&apos;s listen to some cells:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Mute tracks 2–6 and select a cell in track 1. </li>
				<li>You will see a Play arrow appear. If you click on it, you will hear the cell. Press the spacebar to stop.</li>
				<li>Listen to the different track 1 cells.</li>
				<li>Unmute track 2 and now you will hear the cells in both tracks playing together.</li>
				<li>Proceed in a similar fashion with the other tracks.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now, let&apos;s trigger some scenes, which you see laid out at the bottom of the grid. Simply click on the <strong class="bold">Scene Trigger</strong> button on the arrow above the <strong class="bold">Scene number</strong>. Notice that in this starter grid, each cell and the first five scenes are 8 bars long. Scenes 6–12 take 4 bars to play all the way through.</p>
			<p>Key commands are especially helpful with Live Loops. Let&apos;s look at some.</p>
			<p>Press <strong class="bold">Option</strong> + <strong class="bold">Return</strong> and you will see that the transport begins to progress through the project, but you don&apos;t <a id="_idIndexMarker315"></a>hear anything. That is because it has taken the cells out of the queue. Pressing them a second time puts them back in the queue.</p>
			<p>With all the cells no longer queued, you can add cells to the queue by <strong class="bold">Ctrl</strong> + clicking them and using the shortcut menu to add them to the queue. You can also add scenes to the queue by <strong class="bold">Ctrl</strong> + clicking the <strong class="bold">Scene Trigge</strong><strong class="bold">r</strong> buttons.</p>
			<p>Right next to the <strong class="bold">View</strong> menu are the <strong class="bold">Show/Hide</strong> buttons for the Live Loops grid and the <strong class="bold">Tra</strong><strong class="bold">cks</strong> view: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer135" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__10.2_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 10.2 – Show/Hide buttons&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.2 – Show/Hide buttons</p>
			<p>You can switch between them or see both. The key commands are user-friendly:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Option</strong> + <strong class="bold">L</strong> for <strong class="bold">Show Live Loops</strong><strong class="bold"> Grid</strong> only</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Option</strong> + <strong class="bold">N</strong> for <strong class="bold">Show Tracks View</strong> only (presently empty)</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Option</strong> + <strong class="bold">B</strong> for <strong class="bold">Show Live Loops Grid</strong> and <strong class="bold">T</strong><strong class="bold">racks View</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Option</strong> + <strong class="bold">V</strong> to toggle between <strong class="bold">Live Loops Grid</strong> and <strong class="bold">T</strong><strong class="bold">racks View</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you have both the <strong class="bold">Live Loops</strong> grid and <strong class="bold">Tracks Area</strong> showing, there is an adjustable <strong class="bold">Divider column</strong>, and at the bottom is the <strong class="bold">Grid St</strong><strong class="bold">op</strong> button:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer136" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__10.3_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 10.3 – The Divider column and the Grid Stop button&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.3 – The Divider column and the Grid Stop button</p>
			<p>You now have a basic <a id="_idIndexMarker316"></a>understanding of the relationship between cells and scenes and how they are triggered. Let&apos;s move on to editing a cell.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-149"><a id="_idTextAnchor174"></a>Editing cells</h1>
			<p>Open the Inspector <a id="_idIndexMarker317"></a>and select a <strong class="bold">cell</strong>, and now you will <a id="_idIndexMarker318"></a>see the <strong class="bold">Cell </strong><strong class="bold">inspector</strong>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer137" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__10.4_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 10.4 – The Cell inspector&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.4 – The Cell inspector</p>
			<p>Wow, that is a lot of control! We will cover these briefly, as you will find experimenting with them more informative than what we can cover in this book.</p>
			<p>For <strong class="bold">Play Mode</strong>, you have three choices:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Start/Stop</strong>: Clicking a <a id="_idIndexMarker319"></a>cell starts and stops playback.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Momentary</strong>: Cells <a id="_idIndexMarker320"></a>play as long as you click and hold them.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Retrigger</strong>: Clicking an additional time starts playback from the beginning of the cell.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong class="bold">Quantize Start</strong> can be set globally in the <strong class="bold">Quantize Start</strong> menu at the top right of the <strong class="bold">Live Loops</strong> grid, or for a scene by <strong class="bold">Ctrl</strong> + clicking the <strong class="bold">Scene Trigger</strong> buttons, or for individual cells. Selecting a specific <strong class="bold">Quantize Start</strong> value allows you to determine, if the cell is not triggered from the beginning, where it starts. <strong class="bold">Quantize Loop Start</strong> only matters if you have <strong class="bold">Play Mode</strong> set to <strong class="bold">S</strong><strong class="bold">tart/Stop</strong>.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reverse</strong>, <strong class="bold">Speed</strong>, the <strong class="bold">Play From</strong> choices, and the rest are all pretty much self-explanatory, until we get to the <strong class="bold">Recording</strong> options, which we will explore a little later in this chapter.</p>
			<p>There is a <strong class="bold">Cell Editor</strong>, but since when you select a MIDI cell you see <strong class="bold">Piano Roll</strong>, with an <strong class="bold">Audio cell</strong>, a waveform, a <strong class="bold">Pattern cell</strong>, the <strong class="bold">Step Sequencer</strong>, a <strong class="bold">Drummer cell</strong>, and the <a id="_idIndexMarker321"></a>Drummer editor, for me, this isn&apos;t really a distinct editor; it just opens various editors with some slight <a id="_idIndexMarker322"></a>differences. Since you are already now familiar with those editors, I will not go into the Cell Editor further here.</p>
			<p>Next up, we&apos;ll learn how to create scenes from cells.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-150"><a id="_idTextAnchor175"></a>Creating scenes from cells </h1>
			<p>I think we will be <a id="_idIndexMarker323"></a>better served by creating a new <strong class="bold">Live Loops</strong> project for this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Go to <strong class="bold">New</strong> from <strong class="bold">Template</strong> and <a id="_idIndexMarker324"></a>open a new <strong class="bold">Live Loop</strong><strong class="bold">s</strong> project.</li>
				<li>With both the <strong class="bold">Live Loop</strong> grid and the <strong class="bold">Tracks area</strong> open, you can see that I have added a bunch of Apple Loops to the <strong class="bold">Tracks area</strong> that I like:<div id="_idContainer138" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Figure__10.5_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 10.5 – Apple Loops added to the Tracks area&#xd;&#xa;" /></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.5 – Apple Loops added to the Tracks area</p></li>
				<li>Add the <strong class="bold">Apple Loops</strong> to empty <strong class="bold">cells</strong> in the <strong class="bold">Live Loops grid</strong> by dragging and <a id="_idIndexMarker325"></a>dropping them in, and try out different combinations <a id="_idIndexMarker326"></a>in the queue; I arrived at the following:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer139" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__10.6_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 10.6 – Apple Loops added to the Live Loops grid&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.6 – Apple Loops added to the Live Loops grid</p>
			<p>I have four scenes ready to be triggered. I can move or copy cells from one scene to another the same way I move and copy regions in the Tracks area, either dragging them to move or <strong class="bold">Option</strong> + dragging them to copy. If you drag a cell on top of another, it replaces it. I can now delete the Apple Loops from the Tracks area since I no longer need them if I choose.</p>
			<p>While I used <a id="_idIndexMarker327"></a>Apple Loops for convenience, remember, you can <a id="_idIndexMarker328"></a>perform the same tasks with any audio regions.</p>
			<p>This is great so far, but wouldn&apos;t it be awesome if I could record a software instrument part in a cell, or even a vocal sound? Well, you can, and here&apos;s how.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-151"><a id="_idTextAnchor176"></a>Recording into cells </h1>
			<p>I decide, crazy <a id="_idIndexMarker329"></a>guy that I am, that I want to record hand claps into a cell through <strong class="bold">Amp</strong><strong class="bold"> Designer</strong>:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create <a id="_idIndexMarker330"></a>an <strong class="bold">audio track</strong> in the <strong class="bold">t</strong><strong class="bold">rack list</strong>.</li>
				<li>At the desired location, create a cell by <strong class="bold">Ctrl</strong> + clicking the empty cell space.</li>
				<li>Again, <strong class="bold">Ctrl</strong> + click the cell and choose <strong class="bold">Record Into Cell</strong>, then clap your hands repeatedly for as long as you like.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Yes, it is that easy. I now decide I want to add a <strong class="bold">Vintage Electric Piano</strong> cell. It&apos;s the same process:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create a <strong class="bold">Software Instrument</strong> track in the <strong class="bold">track list</strong> with <strong class="bold">Vintage Elect</strong><strong class="bold">ric Piano</strong>.</li>
				<li>At the desired location, create a MIDI cell by <strong class="bold">Ctrl</strong> + clicking the empty cell space.</li>
				<li>Again, <strong class="bold">Ctrl</strong> + click the cell and choose <strong class="bold">Record Into Cell</strong>, then play your electric piano part for as long as you like.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now that I <a id="_idIndexMarker331"></a>have all my cells and scenes to my satisfaction, I <a id="_idIndexMarker332"></a>want to record a performance to the Tracks area. As you will see, it isn&apos;t difficult, and you can even do this by triggering cells or scenes in real time.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-152"><a id="_idTextAnchor177"></a>Recording a performance to the Tracks area</h1>
			<p>I have <strong class="bold">Grid Quantize Start</strong> set <a id="_idIndexMarker333"></a>in the <strong class="bold">Quantize Start</strong> menu to <strong class="bold">Cell End</strong>. Right above the first cell in the first track is the <strong class="bold">Enable Performance Recording</strong> button, which if you click, turns a bright red:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer140" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__10.7_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 10.7 – The Enable Performance Recording button&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.7 – The Enable Performance Recording button</p>
			<p>Let&apos;s begin recording:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Press <strong class="bold">Option</strong> + <strong class="bold">Return</strong> so that no cells or scenes are queued.</li>
				<li>You can set your <strong class="bold">Count-In</strong> and <strong class="bold">Metronome</strong> settings to whatever you prefer.</li>
				<li>Press the <strong class="bold">Record</strong> button <a id="_idIndexMarker334"></a>in the <strong class="bold">Transport Bar</strong> or <strong class="bold">R</strong> on your keyboard.</li>
				<li>If while it is recording you select a cell, <strong class="bold">Shift</strong> + <strong class="bold">select</strong>, or rubber-band over some cells and hit the <strong class="bold">Return</strong> key, it will record them as regions in the <strong class="bold">Tr</strong><strong class="bold">acks area</strong>.</li>
				<li>If while it is recording you select the <strong class="bold">Scene Trigger</strong> button, it will record the cells in the scene as regions in the <strong class="bold">Tr</strong><strong class="bold">acks area</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you have completed your performance recording, right at the top of the divider line is a double-arrow icon, which allows you to switch between whether the Live Loops grid will have Track Priority or the Tracks area:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer141" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__10.8_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 10.8 – Track Priority arrows&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.8 – Track Priority arrows</p>
			<p>I am not going to lie, doing this <a id="_idIndexMarker335"></a>from your computer with a mouse and keyboard does not feel as fluid as it should be. However, there are, at the time I am writing this, a couple of alternat<a id="_idTextAnchor178"></a>ives.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-153"><a id="_idTextAnchor179"></a>Logic Remote</h2>
			<p>There is a free companion app for the iPad and iPhone called <strong class="bold">Logic Remote</strong> that users have found very <a id="_idIndexMarker336"></a>useful. It has been updated to incorporate all the new features and it is just great for triggering cells and scenes to record a performance in real time. If you have a reasonably robust internet connection, you are probably going to really like it.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-154"><a id="_idTextAnchor180"></a>Novation Launchpad and Launchkey MIDI controllers</h2>
			<p>For those of you <a id="_idIndexMarker337"></a>who prefer the feel of hardware and have a few bucks to spare, Novation has a line of MIDI controllers in a wide price range that are great for working with <a id="_idIndexMarker338"></a>Live Loops. They were originally designed to work with Ableton Live, but they now work with Logic&apos;s Live Loops as well.</p>
			<p>With this new <strong class="bold">Live Loops</strong> feature, surely there are some new FX designed especially for it? You betcha. Let&apos;s take a look at <strong class="bold">Remix FX</strong>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-155"><a id="_idTextAnchor181"></a>Remix FX</h1>
			<p>In addition to its Phat and Step multi-FX, we now have Remix FX, which you will find in the <strong class="bold">Multi Effects</strong> folder. It is <a id="_idIndexMarker339"></a>designed to be used on the stereo output, but you can <a id="_idIndexMarker340"></a>use it on individual tracks or auxes as well.</p>
			<p>Those of you who have used GarageBand for iOS will already be familiar with it. Unlike most of  the Logic Pro FX plugins, these are designed to be used live, DJ style.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-156"><a id="_idTextAnchor182"></a>Overview</h2>
			<p>There are seven <a id="_idIndexMarker341"></a>areas in the Remix FX plugin that you can utilize:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Filter</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Gater</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Reverse</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Stop</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Scratch</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">D</strong><strong class="bold">ownsampler</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Repeater</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p>They are controlled by two XY pads, buttons, some faders, and sliders. There are dedicated <strong class="bold">Smart Controls</strong> mapped to it. If you open the <strong class="bold">Smart Controls</strong>, though, I notice that they look quite different if Remix FX is on the stereo output or on a track, but more on that in a while.</p>
			<p>To the left side and the right side are the two XY pads, assigned to <strong class="bold">Filter</strong> and <strong class="bold">Repeater</strong>, but if you click on the words <strong class="bold">Filter</strong> and <strong class="bold">Repeater</strong>, you will see that each XY pad has a choice of six different FX that you can control from them:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer142" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__10.9_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 10.9 – XY pad choices in the Remix FX plugin&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.9 – XY pad choices in the Remix FX plugin</p>
			<p>You cannot set both XY pads to the same FX. As you choose different FX, you will see that the options of what to control with that FX update to reflect the things it was designed to do.</p>
			<p>To the right of the left XY pad is a <a id="_idIndexMarker342"></a>slider that controls <strong class="bold">Gater</strong>, and if you click on the icon to the right of it, you see some settings choices for a selected effect appear:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer143" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__10.10_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 10.10 – Settings for a selected effect&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.10 – Settings for a selected effect</p>
			<p>If you drag the slider up and down while the project is playing, you hear the cool gating FX more or less as you drag it. Very cool.</p>
			<p>The second slider controls <strong class="bold">Downsampler</strong>, either in <strong class="bold">Classic</strong> or <strong class="bold">Ext</strong><strong class="bold">reme</strong> mode.</p>
			<p>The three buttons in between the sliders control, from top to bottom, <strong class="bold">Reverse Timing</strong>, <strong class="bold">Scratching</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Tape Stop</strong> to slow down all things DJs do in real time:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer144" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__10.11_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 10.11 – Real-time DJ-style effects&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.11 – Real-time DJ-style effects</p>
			<p>There are locks to lock <a id="_idIndexMarker343"></a>the pads in their current state so that you can then chose another FX to control with the XY pad. You can also unlock the locks, while reset does just that, it resets the FX. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-157"><a id="_idTextAnchor183"></a>Capturing Remix FX with Automation</h2>
			<p>We can automate <a id="_idIndexMarker344"></a>our FX for specific scenes or the entire project, either by selecting the scene to be queued in the Live Loops grid or <a id="_idIndexMarker345"></a>setting a Cycle in the <strong class="bold">Tr</strong><strong class="bold">acks</strong> view:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Add the stereo output to the track list by selecting it in the <strong class="bold">Mixer</strong> and either assign it to an <strong class="bold">Automation</strong> mode or press <strong class="bold">Shift</strong> + <strong class="bold">Command</strong> + <strong class="bold">M</strong>. It immediately goes to the bottom of the track list and cannot be moved.</li>
				<li>Assign the <strong class="bold">Automation</strong> mode to <strong class="bold">Latch</strong>. <strong class="bold">Latch</strong> must be used instead of <strong class="bold">Touch</strong> if any of the FX movements are locked, and is the best choice for this task because it doesn&apos;t snap back to the original setting when you release the mouse.</li>
				<li>Put the project into play and have fun with the FX; Logic will automatically create <strong class="bold">Automation Lanes</strong> for every parameter you use.</li>
				<li>Change the <strong class="bold">Automation</strong> mode to <strong class="bold">Read</strong>, and you are done.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The biggest disadvantage to this perhaps is that the Smart Controls that appear on Remix FX on the stereo output cannot be used for automation, so you have to do it in the plugin. But also, what if you don&apos;t want every track to have these FX, only certain ones? </p>
			<p>The following solution kills both birds with one stone.</p>
			<p>Select the tracks you wish to affect and change their output assignment from <strong class="bold">Stereo Output</strong> to an available bus by holding down the mouse on the output assignment and selecting an unused <a id="_idIndexMarker346"></a>bus send. Logic creates an aux to host that bus:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Move the Remix <a id="_idIndexMarker347"></a>plugin from the stereo output to the new aux. </li>
				<li>Automate the FX to your heart&apos;s content as before in the plugin <em class="italic">or</em> from the Smart Controls.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now, only the tracks you wish to be affected, in the parts of the song you want them to be affected, are, and you have more control by adjusting the aux.</p>
			<p>Again, you will probably find using the Remix FX plugin more enjoyable from Logic Remote than with your computer mouse and keyboard, so check it out if you own an iPad or iPhone.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-158"><a id="_idTextAnchor184"></a>Summary</h1>
			<p>You have now seen the power of the Live Loops grid as a creative tool for modern composing in styles such as EDM. By using fully editable cells, assembled into scenes, recording your own audio and software instruments cells, and dragging in existing audio or Apple Loops, you can create a unique performance, and then record it into the Tracks area. Spice it up with the new Remix FX and capture your real-time performance with them with latch automation. This may totally change the way you work.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will learn how to record without a click, yet create a tempo map, affect the timing of imported audio with relation to the project tempo, and adjust the tempo of the audio regions to match the project tempo. We will fix the timing of audio parts with <strong class="bold">Flex Time</strong> and the pitch with <strong class="bold">Flex Pitch</strong>, and use the classic technique from the tape recorder days of Varispeed to speed up or slow down a whole project.</p>
