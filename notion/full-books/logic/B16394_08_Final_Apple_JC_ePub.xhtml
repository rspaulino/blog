			<h1 id="_idParaDest-129"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor149"></a><a id="_idTextAnchor150"></a>Chapter 8</em>:  Logic Pro X&apos;s Step Sequencer</h1>
			<p>Programmable step sequencers have been around for a very long time, in analog synths and drum machines. If you have ever played a kick or snare part into a drum machine, for instance, you have programmed a step sequencer. (For that matter, if you have ever created steps in Ultrabeat, you have done so as well.)</p>
			<p>Until 10.5, though, Logic Pro did not have a proper one, but they do now!</p>
			<p>Specifically, this chapter covers the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The Step Sequencer</li>
				<li>The Pattern Browser</li>
				<li>Pattern Loops</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-130"><a id="_idTextAnchor151"></a>Getting familiar with the Step Sequencer</h1>
			<p>Open Logic Pro <a id="_idIndexMarker271"></a>and choose <strong class="bold">New</strong> from <strong class="bold">Template</strong> and you will see that with 10.5, in <strong class="bold">Project Chooser</strong>, we have a new category called <strong class="bold">Tutorials</strong> and that there is a tutorial for the Step Sequencer. Let&apos;s begin by employing this project:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer114" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__8.1_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 8.1: The Step Sequencer tutorial&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.1: The Step Sequencer tutorial</p>
			<p>As you can see, there are 21 tracks. Each has notes in the Note Pad. In the upper right-hand corner of the Note Pad, there is an arrow you can click on to move to the next entry.</p>
			<p>I suggest that you spend some time with this project over a period of time as you work with the Step Sequencer to gain a deeper understanding if you find this feature attractive for what you want to accomplish musically.</p>
			<p>But you don&apos;t need me for that, so let&apos;s open a new project with an empty software instrument <a id="_idIndexMarker272"></a>channel strip, with <strong class="bold">Open Library</strong> checked. Navigate to <strong class="bold">Electronic Drum Kit</strong> and select <strong class="bold">Brook</strong><strong class="bold">lyn Feels</strong>.</p>
			<p>Click on <strong class="bold">DMD</strong> in the channel strip in the inspector to open the interface, and either play up chromatically from your keyboard starting at <strong class="bold">C1</strong> up to <strong class="bold">D#2</strong>, or click on the kit piece icons in the interface and listen to the very cool sounds.</p>
			<p>We have worked with MIDI regions with software instruments, including Drum Machine Designer, and Drummer regions with Drummer, but we have a new kind of region called a Pattern Region for use with the Step Sequencer.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-131"><a id="_idTextAnchor152"></a>Pattern Regions</h2>
			<p>Create a four-bar <a id="_idIndexMarker273"></a>Pattern Region either by selecting it in the local <strong class="bold">Functions</strong> window or by <strong class="bold">Ctrl</strong> + clicking or right-clicking in the <a id="_idIndexMarker274"></a>Workspace at bar 1 and selecting <strong class="bold">Create Pattern Region</strong>. Immediately, the Step Sequencer editor opens, with <strong class="bold">16 Steps</strong>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer115" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__8.2_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 8.2: The Step Sequencer editor&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.2: The Step Sequencer editor</p>
			<p>Here you see rows, each with <strong class="bold">16 Steps</strong>. Because we chose a DMD kit, the rows are named by the kit pieces rather than the MIDI notes.</p>
			<p>Alternatively, you can create a pattern region by pressing <strong class="bold">E</strong> to open the MIDI editors, choose the <strong class="bold">Step Sequencer</strong> tab, and then click on any step in any row and it creates a four-bar Pattern Region.</p>
			<p>Let&apos;s explore:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the upper right-hand corner, change to <strong class="bold">64</strong> steps. Depending on how big your screen is, you will see more or fewer of the steps.</li>
				<li>Directly above it are two icons that adjust the width of the steps. Click on the larger icon and now you see four <em class="italic">pages</em> with <strong class="bold">16</strong> steps each that you can scroll through.</li>
				<li>For now, let&apos;s <a id="_idIndexMarker275"></a>return to <strong class="bold">16</strong> steps.<p>The default <a id="_idIndexMarker276"></a>for the <strong class="bold">Pattern Region</strong> is 16th note steps, but as you can see, you can change the Step Rate:</p><div id="_idContainer116" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Figure__8.3_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 8.3: Step rate selection&#xd;&#xa;" /></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.3: Step rate selection</p></li>
				<li>You can also assign different step rates for individual Rows:<div id="_idContainer117" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Figure__8.4_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 8.4: Individual row step rate selection&#xd;&#xa;" /></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.4: Individual row step rate selection</p></li>
				<li>If you <a id="_idIndexMarker277"></a>hold down on the <strong class="bold">Velocity/Value</strong> field in the header of the <strong class="bold">Step Sequencer</strong>, you <a id="_idIndexMarker278"></a>will see there are lots of controls for the Rows. Back in the Row headers, clicking on the disclosure triangle to the left of the kit piece icon gives you something similar to <strong class="bold">Global Tracks</strong>, where you can choose to view these Subrows by clicking the <strong class="bold">+</strong> or <strong class="bold">X</strong>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer118" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__8.5_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 8.5: Subrows&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.5: Subrows</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-132"><a id="_idTextAnchor153"></a>Creating Steps in the Pattern Region</h2>
			<p>Like all MIDI regions, a <a id="_idIndexMarker279"></a>Pattern Region follows the Logic project tempo:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Set the tempo to whatever tempo you like and click in some steps. Play and listen as it plays through one time.</li>
				<li>Grab the <strong class="bold">Pattern Region</strong> by the lower right-hand corner, and with <strong class="bold">Resize </strong>tool, drag it to 8 bars; now, just like a Drummer region would, it copies those notes in the <strong class="bold">Pattern Region</strong> and we hear it repeat for that duration.</li>
				<li>Adjust the velocities of the steps either by clicking <strong class="bold">Velocity/Value</strong> and dragging down/up in the step or by opening the disclosure triangle on the Row and dragging up/down on the <strong class="bold">Veloci</strong><strong class="bold">ty</strong> Subrow.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Adjust the <strong class="bold">Gate</strong> time of some of the notes in the same manner.</p>
			<p>You can now move, copy, and shorten any <strong class="bold">Pattern Region</strong> you create in the Tracks area. One issue you need to be aware of, though: if, in the Step Sequencer, you shorten the number of steps, those steps go away. Changing it back to more steps does not restore those steps.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">NOTE</p>
			<p class="callout">This is a bug to be fixed in a later update.</p>
			<p>You can pick the direction the pattern plays back, but even better, you can pick the way each individual Row plays back and move them by increments of one step to the left and one to the right. Your choices are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Forward</strong>: Steps play from left to right.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Backward</strong>: Steps play from right to left.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Ping-Pong</strong>: Playback alternates between left to right and right to left.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Random</strong>: Steps play in an undetermined order:</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer119" class="IMG---Figure">

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-133"><a id="_idTextAnchor154"></a>Editing rows and sounds</h2>
			<p>If you want to <a id="_idIndexMarker280"></a>re-order the Rows in the Step Sequencer, it works exactly as it does in the Track List. Hold the mouse down in the middle of the <strong class="bold">Track Header</strong> and just drag it up or down to your desired location.</p>
			<p>If you want to copy, duplicate, clear, or delete a Row, right-click or <strong class="bold">Ctrl</strong> + click or use the key commands:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer120" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__8.7_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 8.7: Editing Rows&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.7: Editing Rows</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-134"><a id="_idTextAnchor155"></a>The Step Sequencer Local Inspector</h2>
			<p>Directly above the <strong class="bold">Step Rate</strong> value for the Pattern Region, you will see the familiar circled letter &quot;I&quot; that turns on the <a id="_idIndexMarker281"></a>local inspector. It has three tabs for three hierarchies: <strong class="bold">Pattern</strong>, <strong class="bold">Row</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Step</strong>. Like most of Logic&apos;s local inspectors, this is a very handy area to make changes in.</p>
			<p>To the left of it is the <strong class="bold">Pattern Browser</strong> icon. The <strong class="bold">Pattern Browser</strong> is an area where you can choose and save patterns and templates.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-135"><a id="_idTextAnchor156"></a>The Pattern Browser </h1>
			<p>Let&apos;s explore using patterns <a id="_idIndexMarker282"></a>from the browser with different kinds of sounds and with different kinds of Rows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create a new empty software instrument with <strong class="bold">Open Library</strong> checked and load any <strong class="bold">Synthesizer Bass</strong> sound you like.</li>
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">E</strong> to open the MIDI editors, and if it does not default to the Step Sequencer, select it. Notice that instead of showing us kit pieces, it&apos;s showing us MIDI notes.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This is a Notes-type Row. But it is an octave higher than I want for a bass. No problem: under the <strong class="bold">Functions</strong> menu, you will see your transpose options and the related key commands. I could, of course, start programming in steps, as I did with the DMD track, but the <strong class="bold">Pattern Browser</strong> has some goodies for you.</p>
			<p>Open the <strong class="bold">Pattern Browser</strong> by clicking on its icon and you should see three folders: <strong class="bold">User</strong>, <strong class="bold">Patterns</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Templates</strong>.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Patterns</strong> has three categories, <strong class="bold">Bass</strong>, <strong class="bold">Drums</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Melodic</strong>. We want <strong class="bold">Bass</strong>:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Select the top selection, <strong class="bold">Anc</strong><strong class="bold">ient Acid</strong>.</li>
				<li>Set a four-bar cycle and while it is playing, keep pressing the down arrow each pass-through to go to the next one and audition it. There are some awesome ones.</li>
				<li>All the Rows and <a id="_idIndexMarker283"></a>all the Steps are green. As in other areas in Logic, pressing <strong class="bold">Option</strong> + <strong class="bold">C</strong> opens the color palette, and you can color each row. Under the <strong class="bold">View</strong> menu, you can then have it color the steps by Row colors.</li>
				<li>Have fun adding and deleting steps and rows, with all the techniques you learned working with the DMD pattern. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you come up with something you really like, you can save the pattern in the Pattern Browser <strong class="bold">Action</strong> menu, or even as a template, and it will be in the <strong class="bold">Us</strong><strong class="bold">er</strong> folder:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer121" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Fig._8.8r.jpg" alt="Figure 8.8: Saving in the Pattern Browser&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.8: Saving in the Pattern Browser</p>
			<p>A <strong class="bold">Melodic</strong>-type Row is similar to the Note type, just geared more to the kind of sounds you heard with classic step sequencers in analog synthesizers. Again, create an empty software channel strip with <strong class="bold">Open Library</strong> checked, load a synth patch, and in the Pattern Browser, go to <strong class="bold">Melodic</strong> and choose a preset. All that you learned in the two previous patterns <a id="_idIndexMarker284"></a>applies here as well.</p>
			<p>Automation Rows can be created to automate any settings in the plug-ins.</p>
			<p>Click <strong class="bold">+</strong>, scroll to <strong class="bold">Automation</strong>, and choose a setting to automate, as I have done here:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer122" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__8.9_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 8.9: Creating an Automation Row for automating a setting&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.9: Creating an Automation Row for automating a setting</p>
			<p>Now I have an <strong class="bold">Automation</strong> Row for the <strong class="bold">FilterBlend</strong> of the <strong class="bold">ES2</strong>:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Under the <strong class="bold">View</strong> menu, I recommend you select <strong class="bold">Zoom Focused</strong> to see the Row better, and with <strong class="bold">Velocity/Value</strong> selected, just click in values in each step.</li>
				<li>Play and listen and you hear it jump from value to value, but you would probably like the steps to be smoother.</li>
				<li>Open the local inspector and select <strong class="bold">Row</strong>.</li>
				<li>In <strong class="bold">Automation</strong> mode, it <a id="_idIndexMarker285"></a>defaults to <strong class="bold">Latch</strong>, but if you hold the mouse down, you can change it to <strong class="bold">Slide</strong>, which <em class="italic">slides</em> from value to value. <strong class="bold">Latch</strong> just jumps to each value.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>(This use of the word <em class="italic">Latch</em> did confuse me, frankly, because it isn&apos;t like Latch in Track and MIDI region automation, which you use in real time with the project playing.)</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-136"><a id="_idTextAnchor157"></a>Pattern Loops </h1>
			<p>Finally, there <a id="_idIndexMarker286"></a>are also <strong class="bold">Pattern Loops</strong> in the Loop Browser, as you<a id="_idTextAnchor158"></a> can see in the filtering options:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer123" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__8.10_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 8.10: Pattern Loops in the Loop Browser&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.10: Pattern Loops in the Loop Browser</p>
			<p>As with any Apple Loop, you can simply drag it into the Workspace below the other tracks to create a region. Now you can open the Step Sequencer and edit away to make it your own.</p>
			<p>This thing is deep! Now that you have a basic understanding, you may well want to return to the included Logic Pro X Tutorial <a id="_idIndexMarker287"></a>project to further explore the new Step Sequencer.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-137"><a id="_idTextAnchor159"></a>Summary</h1>
			<p>You have now been introduced to what the Step Sequencer is and how its Pattern Regions, Rows, and Steps work together. Like all the MIDI editors&apos; local inspectors, the Step Sequencer local inspector is very helpful. You learned how to alter existing patterns or create your own and save them so that they are available to you in any project with the <strong class="bold">Patter</strong><strong class="bold">n Browser</strong>.</p>
			<p>There are three different Row types: <strong class="bold">Notes</strong>, <strong class="bold">Melodic</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Automation</strong>. <strong class="bold">Pattern Loops</strong> are the latest entry into the Loop Browser choices, for drag and drop part creation.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will become familiar with Logic Pro&apos;s Sampler, formerly the EXS24, Quick Sample, and Auto Sampler.</p>
