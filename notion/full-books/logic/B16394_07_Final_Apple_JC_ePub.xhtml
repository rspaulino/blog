			<h1 id="_idParaDest-117"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor136"></a><a id="_idTextAnchor137"></a>Chapter 7</em>:  Logic Pro X&apos;s Drummer</h1>
			<p>I am not prone to hyperbole, nor am I a fan of marketing hype, but I truly believe that Drummer was and continues to be a game-changer for beginners.</p>
			<p>Do you know what a real drummer actually plays? I did early on, because my dad was a drummer and my first gigs were with him, but if you don&apos;t: your Drummer has arrived!</p>
			<p>Specifically, this chapter covers the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Drummer and the Library</li>
				<li>The arrangement global track</li>
				<li>Customizing a Drum Kit Designer drum kit</li>
				<li>Drum Machine Designer</li>
				<li>Drum synth</li>
				<li>Drummer loops</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-118"><a id="_idTextAnchor138"></a>Getting familiar with Drummer and the Library</h1>
			<p>Open a new project and <a id="_idIndexMarker242"></a>select <strong class="bold">Drummer</strong> from the <strong class="bold">New Tracks Dialog</strong> window to create a Drummer instrument. While it defaults to the <strong class="bold">Rock</strong> genre, if you hold the mouse down on that field, you will see that there are other choices. For now, let&apos;s go with <strong class="bold">Rock</strong> with <strong class="bold">Open Librar</strong><strong class="bold">y</strong> checked.</p>
			<p>What you now have is a <strong class="bold">Drummer</strong> region, with the <strong class="bold">Drummer</strong> <strong class="bold">editor</strong> open, and in the <strong class="bold">Library</strong>, you will see the <a id="_idIndexMarker243"></a>genre choices and multiple drummers within each genre with descriptions of the drummers, and in the <strong class="bold">Sounds</strong> section, a bunch of different drum kits:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer103" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__7.1_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 7.1: A new project with a Drummer created&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.1: A new project with a Drummer created</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">NOTE</p>
			<p class="callout">The &quot;hipper than thou&quot; crowd made merciless fun of the descriptions when Drummer first appeared, but they are accurate and helpful.</p>
			<p>The default <strong class="bold">Rock</strong> drummer is <strong class="bold">Kyle</strong>, and he plays a kit called <strong class="bold">SoCal</strong> and a preset called <strong class="bold">Half-pipe</strong>. Notice that with this choice, <strong class="bold">Drummer</strong> changes the project tempo from <strong class="bold">120 bpm</strong> to <strong class="bold">110 bpm</strong>, a tempo Logic deems appropriate for the genre. If you have, however, already employed a <a id="_idIndexMarker244"></a>MIDI region in the project before opening a <strong class="bold">Drummer</strong> instance, it won&apos;t.</p>
			<p>In the top left of the <strong class="bold">Drummer</strong> <strong class="bold">editor</strong>, you can see an arrow that if you click on, cycles the <strong class="bold">Drumm</strong><strong class="bold">er</strong> region:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer104" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__7.2_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 7.2: Drummer editor cycle arrow&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.2: Drummer editor cycle arrow</p>
			<p>In doing so, and while it is playing, you can change the presets, hear the difference, and check out the XY pad and drum kit area to the right and see how it changes the display. Personally, I am digging <strong class="bold">Ocean Boulevard</strong>, so let&apos;s go with that:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Zoom in<a id="_idIndexMarker245"></a> on the <strong class="bold">Drummer</strong> region and as it is playing, what you see is that it is playing a kick drum, snare drum, and hi-hats, and that is also what you see in the drum kit in the lower-right part of the editor.</li>
				<li>In the XY pad, drag the puck around from <strong class="bold">Loud</strong> to <strong class="bold">Soft</strong> and from <strong class="bold">Simple</strong> to <strong class="bold">Complex</strong>, and listen to how what the drummer is playing changes and how it updates the display in the <strong class="bold">Drumm</strong><strong class="bold">er</strong> region.</li>
				<li>There are eight <em class="italic">increments</em> that change the pattern of <strong class="bold">Kick &amp; Snare</strong>, so listen to those. Then do the same for <strong class="bold">Hi-Hats</strong>.</li>
				<li>Click on either the cymbals or the toms and the hi-hat grays out; you only hear the selected kit pieces, and not the grayed out ones.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Why? Because <strong class="bold">Drummer</strong> is imitating a real drummer, and unless your drummer magically grew more hands, they can&apos;t play them all at the same time! </p>
			<p>This is why I say that not only is <strong class="bold">Drummer</strong> a great way to produce realistic drum parts but it will also educate you about what a real drummer actually plays.</p>
			<p>In the <strong class="bold">Library</strong>, while still in the <strong class="bold">Rock</strong> genre, choose another drummer and a warning appears:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer105" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__7.3_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 7.3: Drummer settings warning message&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.3: Drummer settings warning message</p>
			<p>Eventually, you <a id="_idIndexMarker246"></a>will want to check <strong class="bold">Do not show this message again</strong>, but you might want to wait a while before you do that, until you are more experienced with <strong class="bold">Drummer</strong>. For now, we don&apos;t care, so you can just change the drummer. When you do, you will see that it also changes the drum kit. I suggest you spend some time changing throughout the drummers in the <strong class="bold">Rock</strong>, <strong class="bold">Alternative</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Songwrit</strong><strong class="bold">er</strong> genres.</p>
			<p>Notice that it also changes the tempo, dramatically in some cases, such as the <strong class="bold">Punk Rock</strong> drummer <strong class="bold">Max</strong>.</p>
			<p>What if you don&apos;t love <strong class="bold">Max</strong> for the song you are working on, but love the sound of the <strong class="bold">East Bay</strong> drum kit he is playing?</p>
			<p>If you hold down your mouse on the arrow next to the gear in <strong class="bold">Beat Presets</strong>, you can check <strong class="bold">Keep drum kit when changing drummers</strong>, and that is precisely what will happen:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer106" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__7.4_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 7.4: Keeping the drum kit when changing drummers option&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.4: Keeping the drum kit when changing drummers option</p>
			<p>Let&apos;s agree<a id="_idIndexMarker247"></a> for now that we dig <strong class="bold">Gavin</strong> (his description is funny) playing the <strong class="bold">East Bay</strong> kit. We can now press <strong class="bold">Y</strong> to close the <strong class="bold">Library</strong>:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Choose the preset named <strong class="bold">Th</strong><strong class="bold">e Factory</strong>.</li>
				<li>Turn the <strong class="bold">Fills</strong> button all the way to the left and <strong class="bold">Gavin</strong> no longer plays any fills. Turn it to the right and it increases the number of fills he plays.</li>
				<li>By turning up the <strong class="bold">Swing</strong> button, you can either swing 8ths or 16ths.</li>
				<li>Click on one of the three <strong class="bold">Percussion</strong> symbols to add them (I know, a real drummer can&apos;t do that, but consistency is overrated).</li>
				<li>Click the <strong class="bold">Details</strong> button and three more choices appear.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Let&apos;s talk about <strong class="bold">Feel</strong>. If you come from the east coast of the United States, even if you keep excellent time, you probably play a little on top of the beat, aggressively. If you come from Los Angeles on the west coast, you probably lay behind the beat a bit (think E Street Band versus The Eagles). If you turn on the metronome while Drummer is playing and drag around that dial, you will immediately hear what I am talking about.</p>
			<p>Ghost notes are small syncopations with the kick and snare that real drummers play, but unless the pattern is complex, you probably won&apos;t hear them, although with the dial is set to less or more, you can minimize or maximize the number of them.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Hi-Hat</strong> dial can be set to open and close automatically, simulating the behavior of how hard a real drummer presses down on a hi-hat pedal. You can also, though, set it to your preference. Once you set these to your liking, you can click the <strong class="bold">Details</strong> button again to return to the main display.</p>
			<p>I will now assume that you have the drummer you like playing the kit you like and have made this <a id="_idIndexMarker248"></a>first <strong class="bold">Drummer</strong> region the way you like it.</p>
			<p>Time to create a second <strong class="bold">Drumm</strong><strong class="bold">er</strong> region:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Hold the mouse down immediately to the right of the <strong class="bold">Drummer</strong> region and you will see a <strong class="bold">+</strong> sign.</li>
				<li>Click it and a second identical region is created.</li>
				<li>You can then proceed to alter it in the <strong class="bold">Drummer</strong> <strong class="bold">editor</strong> to your heart&apos;s content.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Well, that&apos;s all fine and dandy, but I want to create an entire song. Don&apos;t worry, you can, and we will explore some ways next, beginning with a global track.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-119"><a id="_idTextAnchor139"></a>Arrangement Global Track</h1>
			<p>If you go<a id="_idIndexMarker249"></a> under the <strong class="bold">Track</strong> menu to <strong class="bold">Global Tracks</strong>, or press <strong class="bold">G</strong>, you can toggle <strong class="bold">Global Tracks</strong> on/off. If you press <strong class="bold">option</strong> + <strong class="bold">G</strong>, you can configure them, and the only one we need for these tasks is <strong class="bold">Arrangement Global Track</strong>. Dragging the bottom line of the track allows you to enlarge the field, making it easier to see. </p>
			<p>Now, we are ready to use <strong class="bold">Arrangement Global Track</strong> to create <strong class="bold">Drummer</strong> regions. Delete the two drummer regions so that we can create regions from scratch:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Click the <strong class="bold">+</strong> sign in <strong class="bold">Arrangement Global Track</strong>, and by default, it creates an 8-bar-long intro Arrangement marker.</li>
				<li>Repeat that process and now it creates an 8-bar verse. I decide that I only want a 4-bar intro, so I grab the lower right-hand corner and resize it to 4 bars, and now the <strong class="bold">Verse Arrangement</strong> marker goes to bar 5.</li>
				<li>Repeat this process 8 more times, and you will probably have <strong class="bold">Intro</strong>, <strong class="bold">Verse</strong>, <strong class="bold">Chorus</strong>, <strong class="bold">Bridge</strong>, <strong class="bold">Outro</strong>, <strong class="bold">Outro</strong>, <strong class="bold">Outro</strong>, <strong class="bold">Outro</strong>, <strong class="bold">Outro</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Outro</strong>, which is not at all what you want, I&apos;m sure.</li>
				<li>Hold the mouse down on the word <strong class="bold">Bridge</strong> and change it to <strong class="bold">Verse</strong>.</li>
				<li>Hold it down again, go to <strong class="bold">Rename</strong>, and make it <strong class="bold">2nd</strong> <strong class="bold">Verse</strong>.</li>
				<li>Change <strong class="bold">Outro</strong> to <strong class="bold">Chorus</strong>.</li>
				<li>Change the next <strong class="bold">Outro</strong> tag to <strong class="bold">Bridge</strong> and resize it to 16 bars, to incorporate a solo.</li>
				<li>Change <a id="_idIndexMarker250"></a>the next two <strong class="bold">Outro</strong> tags to <strong class="bold">Chorus</strong> and leave the outro as <strong class="bold">Outro</strong>. Resize it if you want it longer.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You now have something like this:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer107" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__7.5_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 7.5: Arrangement markers created in Arrangement Global Track&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.5: Arrangement markers created in Arrangement Global Track</p>
			<p>Are you ready for some magic? Right-click in the <strong class="bold">Tracks area</strong> grid next to the track at bar 1 and select <strong class="bold">Populate with Drummer regions</strong>, and it populates the entire Arrangement track with Drummer regions!</p>
			<p>You then can go into each Drummer region and adjust them for how you want them to sound.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-120"><a id="_idTextAnchor140"></a>Converting a Drummer region into a MIDI region</h2>
			<p>Listen to the<a id="_idIndexMarker251"></a> chorus and you may hear a crash <a id="_idIndexMarker252"></a>cymbal at the beginning. Want to get rid of it? You can&apos;t. Oh wait, yes, there <em class="italic">is</em> a way – convert the Drummer region into a MIDI region:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">Ctrl</strong> + click or right-click on the Drummer region:<div id="_idContainer108" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Figure__7.6_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 7.6: Converting a Drummer region into a MIDI region&#xd;&#xa;" /></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.6: Converting a Drummer region into a MIDI region</p></li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Piano Roll</strong> editor opens, and you see the notes and the kit piece names.</li>
				<li>Click the <strong class="bold">Collapse</strong> button right next to <strong class="bold">View</strong> in <strong class="bold">Piano Roll</strong> and now you will see only the kit pieces that have notes played. In my case, I see two <strong class="bold">C#2 Crash L</strong><strong class="bold">eft</strong> notes.</li>
				<li>Click on the kit <a id="_idIndexMarker253"></a>piece name and it<a id="_idIndexMarker254"></a> selects them. Now, hit <strong class="bold">Delete</strong> and they are gone.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now, you could <strong class="bold">CtrI</strong> + click and convert it back to a drummer region. I wish that I could tell you that if you do, the drummer region now reflects your edit, but it doesn&apos;t.</p>
			<p>The other advantage of converting the drummer region into MIDI is that you can use it with any third-party drum libraries you own that do not map to general MIDI. The only thing you lose is the ghost notes.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-121"><a id="_idTextAnchor141"></a>Customizing a Drum Kit Designer drum kit</h1>
			<p>Now <a id="_idIndexMarker255"></a>that you understand how Drummer works, let&apos;s explore all the ways you can change the drum kit itself.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">East Bay</strong> preset in the <strong class="bold">Library</strong> opens a drum kit with an <strong class="bold">EQ</strong>, compressor, and bus send to a reverb. If you press the letter <strong class="bold">B</strong>, the <strong class="bold">Smart Controls</strong> for this preset open.</p>
			<p>Here, you will see an easy way to adjust levels within the kit, turn off kit pieces, and adjust the amount of compression or turn it off. The <strong class="bold">Tone</strong> knob relates to the <strong class="bold">EQ</strong>, and the <strong class="bold">Room</strong> knob affects the amount of bus send to the reverb.</p>
			<p>I suggest you cycle a Drummer region and click on the <strong class="bold">FX</strong> plugins to open them, then resize them on your screen by grabbing the lower right-hand corner. Now, adjust the <strong class="bold">Smart Control</strong> knobs in real time, listening to the changes in the sound and observing the changes you see in the plugin windows. Fifteen minutes of doing so will teach you more than I can about processing drum kit sounds in 200 words in this book:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer109" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__7.7_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 7.7: Smart Controls with the drum kit&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.7: Smart Controls with the drum kit</p>
			<p>Within each <a id="_idIndexMarker256"></a>kit are some optional kit pieces. If you press the mouse down on the kick drum, the default choice appears, as well as two other kick drums. Each one gives you the ability to retune it, dampen it, or make it more open sounding, and increase/decrease the gain. The same is true of the snare drum. There are no options for the toms, hi-hats, or cymbals. Hmmm!</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-122"><a id="_idTextAnchor142"></a>Producer Kits</h2>
			<p>As you can see, the <strong class="bold">EQ</strong> and compressor are applied to the kit, so their settings apply to the entire kit. That may be fine for down-and-dirty quickie demos, but it is not the kind of control you really want to have when you want to mix seriously. We will be discussing that in great detail in <a href="B16394_14_Final_Apple_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor233"><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em></a>, <em class="italic">Mixing Your Project in Log</em><em class="italic">ic Pro X</em>. </p>
			<p>What we really need instead of a stereo kit is a multi-output kit. In Logic Pro, this is called a <strong class="bold">Producer Kit</strong>. It <a id="_idIndexMarker257"></a>contains the <strong class="bold">Drum Kit Designer</strong> software instrument with <strong class="bold">aux channels</strong>. Aux, short for auxiliary, channels are destination points for bus sends and multi-output software instruments (essentially, this is a <strong class="bold">Summing Stack</strong>, which we discussed in <a href="B16394_05_Final_Apple_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor095"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Record</em><em class="italic">ing MIDI</em>):</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Press <strong class="bold">Y</strong> to open the <strong class="bold">Library</strong>.</li>
				<li>Scroll down to <strong class="bold">Producer Kits</strong> and click the disclosure triangle to reveal them. You will see that they all have <strong class="bold">+</strong> next to them, which means they will use the <strong class="bold">Drum Kit Designer</strong> with kit pieces already assigned to come up on its separate aux channels, to give you control over their level and add plugins to the individual kit pieces, as well as control how much of the room sound you hear, leak from microphones, and overhead mics.</li>
				<li>Select <strong class="bold">East Bay +</strong>, close the <strong class="bold">Library</strong>, and press <strong class="bold">X</strong> to open the mixer.</li>
				<li>Click the <strong class="bold">East Bay +</strong> disclosure triangle and now you will see the entire <strong class="bold">Pro</strong><strong class="bold">ducer Kit</strong>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer110" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__7.8_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 7.8: The East Bay+ Producer Kit in the Mixer&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.8: The East Bay+ Producer Kit in the Mixer</p>
			<p>But wait, there&apos;s more! Back in the <strong class="bold">Drum Kit Designer</strong> interface, click on the kick drum and notice how now there are many, many more kick drum choices for this kit. Ditto for the snare. And also, now we have additional choices for the toms, hi hats and cymbals – all with the options to tweak them.</p>
			<p>Once you have <a id="_idIndexMarker258"></a>made your choices, you can save the drum kit in the <strong class="bold">Library</strong> with another name and you now have it for every Logic project.</p>
			<p>Even the best drummer only has two hands and two feet, so adding a percussionist brings a lot to the table. Let&apos;s see and hear how.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-123"><a id="_idTextAnchor143"></a>Adding a percussionist</h2>
			<p>Let&apos;s add a percussionist, because<a id="_idIndexMarker259"></a> there is nowhere that says you can only use one Drummer instrument:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Click the <strong class="bold">+</strong> at the top of the track list and choose <strong class="bold">Drummer</strong> | <strong class="bold">P</strong><strong class="bold">ercussion</strong>.</li>
				<li>It defaults to <strong class="bold">Isabella</strong>, who plays <strong class="bold">Latin Percussion</strong>, and because we have created the arrangement markers, it populates the whole song.</li>
				<li>There are three <strong class="bold">Percussion</strong> sets to choose from, but if you scroll down to <strong class="bold">Producer kits</strong>, you will see more.</li>
				<li>There are also <strong class="bold">Performance</strong> patches that change what you hear without actually changing anything in the <strong class="bold">Drumm</strong><strong class="bold">er</strong> <strong class="bold">editor</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Amazing, but what if I want to add to what Drummer creates by playing in my own tom fills, for instance, turning off the fills in the Drummer regions?</p>
			<p>You will not see a record button on a <strong class="bold">Drummer channel strip</strong>. They are not playable instruments. But we know that they use <strong class="bold">Drum Kit</strong><strong class="bold"> Designer</strong>:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Click the <strong class="bold">+</strong> at the top of the track list and choose <strong class="bold">Software Instrument</strong> | <strong class="bold">Drum Kit Designer</strong> with <strong class="bold">Open Librar</strong><strong class="bold">y</strong> checked.</li>
				<li>Load the <strong class="bold">East Bay</strong> kit (stereo should be fine for this).</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now you can play in<a id="_idIndexMarker260"></a> your own tom fills or whatever else you like. Best of both worlds, if you ask me.</p>
			<p>Drum Machines were very popular in the &apos;80s, with models such as the Roland CR-78, 707, 8080, 909, and those from Yamaha. The LinnDrum had a different approach, trying to sound more like real drums. Roger Linn, its creator, then partnered to create the Akai MPC 60, which took drum machines to a new level.</p>
			<p>Eventually, though, after a while, their popularity diminished until Hip Hop pioneers, looking for a cheap or even free rhythm source, discovered them at pawn shops and in trash cans, made some hits with them, and then the drum machine was back with a vengeance!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-124"><a id="_idTextAnchor144"></a>Drum Machine Designer</h1>
			<p>Logic Pro long ago added their<a id="_idIndexMarker261"></a> software instrument emulation of a classic drum<a id="_idIndexMarker262"></a> machine called <strong class="bold">Ultrabeat</strong>. Ultrabeat in turn became the engine of <strong class="bold">Drum Machine Designer</strong>. <strong class="bold">Drum Machine Designer</strong> has received a significant upgrade in 10.5, with a lot more kits, some of which even include guitar, piano, and bass sounds, and now it uses Logic Pro X 10.5&apos;s Quick Sampler as its basis rather than Ultrabeat, which is a significant improvement in capability, so you are getting on board at the right time:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Press <strong class="bold">Shift</strong> + <strong class="bold">Command</strong> + <strong class="bold">N</strong> to open a new project, and again create a Drummer channel strip, this time with <strong class="bold">Hip Hop</strong> as the genre.</li>
				<li>Everything you learned with <strong class="bold">Drum Kit Designer</strong> in terms of the <strong class="bold">Library</strong>, <strong class="bold">Drummer region</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Smart Controls</strong> applies with DMD as well.</li>
				<li>Let&apos;s go with <strong class="bold">Anton</strong> and change <strong class="bold">Electronic Drum Kit</strong> to <strong class="bold">Hyb</strong><strong class="bold">rid Knock</strong>.</li>
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">Y</strong> to close the <strong class="bold">Library</strong> and <strong class="bold">X</strong> to open the mixer.</li>
				<li>In the Mixer, under the <strong class="bold">View</strong> menu, uncheck <strong class="bold">Follow Track Stacks</strong>. This allows you to see all the <strong class="bold">aux channel strips</strong> in the Mixer by pressing the disclosure triangle while leaving the <strong class="bold">Track Stack</strong> closed in the track list.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Here, you can see <a id="_idIndexMarker263"></a>DMD in all its glory:</p>
			<div>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.9: Drum Machine Designer hybrid knock</p>
			<p>Notice that in the upper right-hand corner of the Mixer, I have clicked the tab for <strong class="bold">Wide Channel Strips</strong> to see the names better.</p>
			<p>Like the <strong class="bold">Producer Kits</strong> with <strong class="bold">Drum Kit Designer</strong>, this is a <strong class="bold">Summing Stack</strong>, but instead of auxes, it has instances of the new Quick Sampler, which I will go into more in <a href="B16394_09_Final_Apple_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor160"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Working with Sampler, Quick Sampler, and Auto Sampler</em>. Click on each one in the Mixer and you will see that they each have a loaded sample.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Drum Machine Designer</strong> has<a id="_idIndexMarker264"></a> its <strong class="bold">Smart Controls</strong> built right into the interface that affects the whole kit:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Cycle the region and tweak them; listen to how the sound changes.</li>
				<li>Click on a kit piece, however, and you will see that you have options. It defaults to the <strong class="bold">Q-Sampler Main</strong> tab. For now, just toggle between <strong class="bold">Classic</strong> and <strong class="bold">One Shot</strong>. <strong class="bold">Classic</strong> plays the sample only for as long as you hold down the key. <strong class="bold">One Shot</strong> plays the entire sample, regardless of how long you hold down the key. </li>
				<li>Switch to the <strong class="bold">Q-Sampler Details</strong> tab and here you will see the sampler controls that allow you to tailor the sound. If you have some experience with the pre-10.5 version, I think you will find that this is indeed an upgrade.</li>
				<li>Switch to the <strong class="bold">Pad Control</strong> tab and now you will see some <strong class="bold">Smart Controls</strong> that only pertain to that kit piece.</li>
				<li>Play a kit piece and open the <strong class="bold">Library</strong> and wow, you have a ton of choices for a snare sound.</li>

			<p><strong class="bold">Anton</strong> changed the <strong class="bold">Logic Pro X</strong> project<a id="_idIndexMarker265"></a> tempo to 85, but I want it a bit brighter, so I&apos;ll double-click on the tempo in the LCD and change it; but when I play it against the click, that sure doesn&apos;t sound like 100 bpm to me, it sounds like half of that.</p>
			<p>The answer to this and some other things lies in the <strong class="bold">Details</strong> button of the DMD editor:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the DMD editor, by either double-clicking on the region, pressing <strong class="bold">E</strong> to open the editor, or pressing the editor button in the control bar and it looks pretty much like the DKD editor, with some different icons to reflect that they are electronic sounds, rather than realistic drum sounds.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Details</strong> button and this, however, looks quite different from DKD. Notice that <strong class="bold">Auto half-time</strong> is checked. Uncheck it, and now you will hear the region playing at 110. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker266"></a>reasoning is that <strong class="bold">Hip Hop</strong> is almost always fairly slow, but if you want somewhere in between, unchecking this and adjusting the tempo will get you where you want to go. I settled for 90 bpm.</p>
			<p>You will see a bunch of <strong class="bold">Complexity Range</strong> sliders here as well. They allow you to adjust how complex each individual kit piece&apos;s part is, despite where the puck is in the XY pad.</p>
			<p>The original drum machines were very mechanical, locked strictly to the grid. Later ones had the ability to make it less hard quantized and to vary a bit each time it played through the pattern. DMD&apos;s <strong class="bold">Humanize</strong> and <strong class="bold">Phase Variation</strong> knobs emulate that behavior.</p>
			<p>Let&apos;s switch genres to <strong class="bold">E</strong><strong class="bold">lectronic</strong>:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Drag the <strong class="bold">Track Header</strong> to the left and it goes poof! It also asks you to create a new track.</li>
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">Drummer</strong> with the <strong class="bold">Electronic</strong> genre and with <strong class="bold">Open Librar</strong><strong class="bold">y</strong> checked.</li>
				<li>It defaults to <strong class="bold">Magnus</strong> playing the <strong class="bold">Big Room</strong> electronic set.</li>
				<li>It also changes the tempo to <strong class="bold">145</strong> because EDM, Techno, Trance, and so on all tend to be at fast tempos.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Everything you learned about DMD with <strong class="bold">Hip Hop</strong> applies here as well.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-126"><a id="_idTextAnchor146"></a>Drum Synth</h1>
			<p>Then<a id="_idIndexMarker267"></a> there is <strong class="bold">Drum Synth</strong>, another playable software instrument:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Click the <strong class="bold">+</strong> at the top of the track list and choose <strong class="bold">Software Instrument</strong> | <strong class="bold">Drum Synth</strong> with <strong class="bold">Open Librar</strong><strong class="bold">y</strong> checked.</li>
				<li>Here, you will see your choices for playable electronic drum sounds.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Combining drummers and playable <a id="_idIndexMarker268"></a>software drum sounds gives you an incredible ability to quickly create fantastic drum and percussion sounds for almost any genre once you are proficient with the workflow.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-127"><a id="_idTextAnchor147"></a>Drummer Loops</h1>
			<p>Finally, we<a id="_idIndexMarker269"></a> have <strong class="bold">Drummer Loops</strong> in the <strong class="bold">Loop Browser</strong>. If you open the <strong class="bold">Loop Browser</strong>, you have the ability to filter in/out the type of loops you see listed. Here, I have unchecked all but <strong class="bold">Drum</strong><strong class="bold">mer Loops</strong>:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.10: List of the different loops</p>
			<p>As always in the <strong class="bold">Loop Browser</strong>, you can winnow it down even more by choosing a genre and a descriptor.</p>
			<p>With <strong class="bold">Drummer Loops</strong> (and other drum loops), you can <a id="_idIndexMarker270"></a>create an entire song&apos;s drums and percussion quickly and easily by dragging them into the Tracks area as well.</p>
			<p>So much power, so much flexibility, so easy to use. Ladies and gentlemen, Logic Pro X 10.5!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-128"><a id="_idTextAnchor148"></a>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, you were introduced to Logic Pro X&apos;s amazing Drummer and the drummers and drum kits in the <strong class="bold">Library</strong>.</p>
			<p>You have learned how to customize the drum kit and now know why I recommend you use the <strong class="bold">Producer Kits</strong>. Yes, you have percussionists to play with your drummer. When you want to add <strong class="bold">Hip Hop</strong> and <strong class="bold">EDM</strong> drum machine sounds, <strong class="bold">Machine Drum Designer</strong> is just the ticket, while the playable <strong class="bold">Drum Synth</strong> option allows you to play in your own parts. Also, as you learned, in the <strong class="bold">Loop Browser</strong>, there are <strong class="bold">drummer loops</strong> for drag-and-drop drum part creation.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will become familiar with 10.5&apos;s brand-new Step Sequencer and how to creatively use it. Also, you will learn how to integrate it with <strong class="bold">Drum Machine Designer</strong>. <strong class="bold">Pattern Browser</strong> gives you a place to alter existing patterns, or create your own, and save them. The latest additions to the Apple Loop Browser are <strong class="bold">Pattern Loops</strong>, which, like all Apple Loops, you can drag and drop from the Browser for part creation.</p>
