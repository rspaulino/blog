			<p>Organization is essential because an ounce of preparation is worth a pound of cure. Mixing is difficult, so we want to do anything we can to get our project ready to go.</p>
			<p>We will discuss the following topics in this chapter:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Folder Stacks in the Track List</li>
				<li>The Mixer&apos;s three views – <strong class="bold">Single</strong>, <strong class="bold">Track</strong><strong class="bold">s</strong>, and <strong class="bold">All</strong></li>
				<li>Advantageous use of Screensets</li>
				<li>Creating Markers and using them for navigation</li>
				<li>Giant Beats and Bar display</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you like, you can either use the project from <a href="B16394_12_Final_Apple_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor193"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></a>, <em class="italic">Getting the Arrangement Right</em>, for this or use your own.</p>
			<p>As you can see, I have already made a good start to getting organized. There are not that many tracks and my track and region names match, and they are colored so that they are easily identifiable, as we discussed in <a href="B16394_04_Final_Apple_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor074"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Edit</em><em class="italic">ing Audio</em>:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.1 – A project with tracks and regions name- and color-matched</p>
			<p>But since I am mostly now going to be working with the Mixer, maybe I don&apos;t need to see all of them all of the time. Let&apos;s see what we can do about that.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-183"><a id="_idTextAnchor214"></a>Getting familiar with Folder Stacks </h1>
			<p>In <a href="B16394_05_Final_Apple_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor095"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Recording MIDI</em>, we were introduced to <strong class="bold">Summing Stacks</strong>, and we could well employ them here, but <a id="_idIndexMarker397"></a>since all we are looking at is organization, there is another type of <strong class="bold">Track Stack</strong>, called a <strong class="bold">Folder Stack</strong>, that is well suited for this purpose.</p>
			<p>Following my color-coding, I now want to create four Folder Stacks.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-184"><a id="_idTextAnchor215"></a>Creating Folder Stacks</h2>
			<p>With all the vocal tracks <a id="_idIndexMarker398"></a>selected, if I go under the <strong class="bold">Track</strong> menu to <strong class="bold">Create Track Stack</strong>, or press <strong class="bold">Shift</strong> + <strong class="bold">Command</strong> + <strong class="bold">D</strong>, I am given a choice between creating a <strong class="bold">Summing Stack</strong> and a <strong class="bold">Folder Stack</strong>. The description tells me that <strong class="bold">Folder Stack</strong> is well suited for the simple organization of tracks in the track list:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer175" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__13.2_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 13.2 – Creating a Folder Stack&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.2 – Creating a Folder Stack</p>
			<p>Let&apos;s begin with a <strong class="bold">Folder Stack</strong> for the vocals:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">Folder Stack</strong> and you will now have a <strong class="bold">Folder Stack</strong> named <strong class="source-inline">Sub 1</strong> with a waveform icon <a id="_idIndexMarker399"></a>and a different color.</li>
				<li>Double-click on the name in the Track Header and rename it <strong class="source-inline">Vocals</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Ctrl</strong> + click on the icon and switch to one that looks like it is for vocals.</li>
				<li>Finally, open the color palette by pressing <strong class="bold">Option</strong> + <strong class="bold">C</strong> and give it the same color as the vocal tracks.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>I now have a <strong class="bold">Folder Stack</strong> for the vocals:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer176" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__13.3_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 13.3 – A Folder Stack&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.3 – A Folder Stack</p>
			<p>Following the same procedure, I will now create the remaining three Folder Stacks. Here is what I see with all the Folder Stacks open. You can open and close the Folder Stacks by toggling the disclosure triangle:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer177" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__13.4_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 13.4 – Folder Stacks opened with the disclosure triangle&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.4 – Folder Stacks opened with the disclosure triangle</p>
			<p>If you press <strong class="bold">Option</strong> + <strong class="bold">K</strong> to open <a id="_idIndexMarker400"></a>your key commands and in the search file you type the word <strong class="source-inline">Stack</strong>, you will see that there are helpful key commands for toggling <strong class="bold">Track Stacks</strong> open and closed, two assigned, two unassigned:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer178" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__13.5_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 13.5 – Key commands for opening and closing Track Stacks&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.5 – Key commands for opening and closing Track Stacks</p>
			<p>I actually prefer using the key commands to toggle a given <strong class="bold">Track Stack</strong> open/closed and all of them to toggle open/closed, so I would definitely recommend assigning a key command to those.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-185"><a id="_idTextAnchor216"></a>Folder Stacks and the Mixer</h2>
			<p>If you open the Mixer by pressing <strong class="bold">X</strong> on your keyboard, you will see that if the <strong class="bold">Folder Stacks</strong> are open <a id="_idIndexMarker401"></a>in the Track List, they are open in the Mixer, and if they are <a id="_idIndexMarker402"></a>closed in the track list, they are closed in the Mixer. If you like that default behavior, that&apos;s fine. If you prefer, though, to have the stacks displayed independently in the Mixer from the Track List, it&apos;s easy to change it. In the following screenshot, you can see that under the Mixer&apos;s <strong class="bold">View</strong> menu, <strong class="bold">Follow Track Stacks</strong> is checked:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer179" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__13.6_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 13.6 – Follow Track Stacks&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.6 – Follow Track Stacks</p>
			<p>Uncheck it. That&apos;s it. And if you click in the Mixer to let Logic know that it is now the window that has what they call <strong class="bold">Key Focus</strong>, you can now toggle the track stacks open and closed in the Mixer.</p>
			<p>Logic Pro X&apos;s Mixer is <a id="_idIndexMarker403"></a>very versatile, with three different views, two <a id="_idIndexMarker404"></a>of which allow you to filter in/out what you wish to see.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-186"><a id="_idTextAnchor217"></a>Mixer views</h1>
			<p>You can either view the <a id="_idIndexMarker405"></a>Mixer as part of the integrated main window by simply pressing <strong class="bold">X</strong> on your computer keyboard, or as a standalone window by going under the <strong class="bold">Window</strong> menu and selecting it, or by pressing <strong class="bold">Command</strong> + <strong class="bold">2</strong> on your keyboard. For now, let&apos;s go with the integrated Mixer.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-187"><a id="_idTextAnchor218"></a>Tracks view</h2>
			<p>This is the default view. It is ordered following the Tracks List order. Across the top on the right are tabs that <a id="_idIndexMarker406"></a>allow you to choose what you want to see displayed at any given time and what you do not. Here, you can see mine with <strong class="bold">Master/VCA</strong> and <strong class="bold">MIDI</strong> filtered out, and without following <strong class="bold">Track Stacks</strong> but with the <strong class="bold">Drums</strong> Folder Stack open:</p>
			<div>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.7 – Tracks view in the Mixer</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">A long-standing request by users to the developers is the ability to reorder tracks directly in the Mixer, disregarding their order in the Track List. Maybe sometime in the future, maybe even by the time this book is in your hands, this will be possible, but at the time of writing, sorry, but it&apos;s not possible.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-188"><a id="_idTextAnchor219"></a>Single view</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Single</strong> view shows you the entire signal path of the channel strip, including any buses that it is sending to <a id="_idIndexMarker407"></a>for FX plugins. It can be very helpful when you are soloing drums, for instance, to balance the kit. It does not allow you to filter in or out anything because that is not its purpose:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.8 – Single view in the Mixer</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-189"><a id="_idTextAnchor220"></a>All view</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">All</strong> view shows you all the <a id="_idIndexMarker408"></a>channel strips that are in your project in the <strong class="bold">En</strong><strong class="bold">vironment</strong>:</p>

			<p>Whaaaatttt? Environment? What&apos;s the Environment?</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-190"><a id="_idTextAnchor221"></a>The Environment – a brief overview</h3>
			<p>For many, many years, if you were learning about Logic Pro, you would have had to learn about <a id="_idIndexMarker409"></a>how to use the <strong class="bold">Environment</strong>. For some users, it was a scary area that was difficult to understand. For those of us who like to get under the hood and understand it, it was a magical area where you could do things you couldn&apos;t really do in other DAWs.</p>
			<p>As a beginner, you will never need to go there. But if you press <strong class="bold">Command</strong> + <strong class="bold">0</strong> on your computer keyboard, it opens up, and you can see that there are layers, and that you can create and delete layers:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer183" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__13.10_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 13.10 – The Environment&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.10 – The Environment</p>
			<p>Every channel strip in your project resides as an <strong class="bold">object</strong> in the <strong class="bold">Environment</strong>, whether you see it in the track list or not. Think of it this way, perhaps: the <strong class="bold">Environment</strong> is your closet, where you keep all your clothing. The track list is a suitcase you pack to take on a trip.</p>
			<p>If you delete a <a id="_idIndexMarker410"></a>channel strip from the <strong class="bold">Environment</strong>, it will not be available in the track list because, continuing with our analogy, you threw that pair of pants out!</p>
			<p>But is the opposite true? That depends on a project setting whose name does not really tip off what it does:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Go to <strong class="bold">File</strong> | <strong class="bold">Project Setting</strong><strong class="bold">s</strong> | <strong class="bold">Audio</strong>.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Channel S</strong><strong class="bold">trips</strong> tab.</li>
				<li>Notice that <strong class="bold">Automatic management of channel strip objects</strong> is checked by default:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer184" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__13.11_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 13.11 – Automatic management of channel strip objects&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.11 – Automatic management of channel strip objects</p>
			<p>If you leave it checked, when you delete a track from the track list, it will also delete the object in the <strong class="bold">Environment</strong>. If you uncheck it, it won&apos;t. You probably want to leave it checked, except possibly in a template <a id="_idIndexMarker411"></a>where you may want things to remain in your <strong class="bold">Environment</strong> that you don&apos;t have in your track list, in case while working you decide you need them.</p>
			<p>As I said, Logic has evolved to a point where you, as a beginner, need not ever have to deal with the <strong class="bold">En</strong><strong class="bold">vironment</strong>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-191"><a id="_idTextAnchor222"></a>Creating customized Screensets</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Screensets</strong> are an <a id="_idIndexMarker412"></a>awesome feature of Logic Pro. They allow easy recall with a keystroke to create combinations of windows and editors, resized and zoomed in the way you want them, with the tool assignment and with <strong class="bold">Snap</strong> and <strong class="bold">Drag</strong> assignments. It&apos;s the only way, for instance, that you can see both the <strong class="bold">Piano Roll</strong> and <strong class="bold">Score</strong> editors in the same window.</p>
			<p>For our purpose in this chapter, we will explore using them to combine Mixer views. The more screen real estate you have with your monitor(s), the more advantageous they can be.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-192"><a id="_idTextAnchor223"></a>Creating a locked custom Screenset</h2>
			<p>Let&apos;s begin by pressing the number <strong class="bold">2</strong> on your computer keyboard. By default, it opens a main <a id="_idIndexMarker413"></a>window. If you click on the <strong class="bold">Close</strong> button at the top-left corner of the window, you will quickly discover that Logic thinks you want to close the project, which you don&apos;t. So, before you can close this window in the Screenset, you need to add another. If you want the Main Window to remain in the Screenset, you can minimize it:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Press <strong class="bold">I</strong> on your computer keyboard to hide the Inspector.</li>
				<li>Go to the <strong class="bold">View</strong> menu and choose <strong class="bold">Hide Co</strong><strong class="bold">ntrol bar</strong>.</li>
				<li>Grab the lower right-hand corner of the window and drag it up and to the left to make it as small as possible.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>My Screenset 2 now looks as in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer185" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__13.12_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 13.12 – A minimized Main Window in Screenset 2&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.12 – A minimized Main Window in Screenset 2</p>
			<p>You are now ready to add a standalone Mixer. Press <strong class="bold">Command</strong> + <strong class="bold">2</strong> on your computer keyboard to open a standalone Mixer. Now you need to decide what you want to see in this Mixer and resize it accordingly if you plan to add a second Mixer. Since many of you are working on a laptop with a single screen, I will assume you just want the one to show you only the audio tracks:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Press <a id="_idIndexMarker414"></a>the tabs at the upper right to filter out everything but <strong class="bold">Audio</strong>.</li>
				<li>Turn off <strong class="bold">Follow Track Stacks</strong>, if that is what you want.</li>
				<li>Position the Mixer on the screen so that it looks the way you want:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer186" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__13.13_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 13.13 – A minimized Main Window and Mixer in Screenset 2&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.13 – A minimized Main Window and Mixer in Screenset 2</p>
			<p>After this is done, you will want to lock the Screenset so that you can always return to this view by pressing the number <strong class="bold">2</strong>. Scroll up to the Screenset number at the top and choose <strong class="bold">Lock</strong>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer187" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__13.14_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 13.14 – Locking a Screenset&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.14 – Locking a Screenset</p>
			<p>Now, if <a id="_idIndexMarker415"></a>you open plugins, zoom in or out, change Screensets, or make any other changes, you can return to this view by pressing the number <strong class="bold">2</strong>.</p>
			<p>If you scroll back up to the number <strong class="bold">2</strong>, you will find an option to rename the Screenset, if you choose.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-193"><a id="_idTextAnchor224"></a>Duplicating a custom Screenset to create another</h2>
			<p>If you are <a id="_idIndexMarker416"></a>happy with the one you created but want another that is almost the same but with a different Mixer view, you don&apos;t need to start from scratch:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Scroll back up to the number <strong class="bold">2</strong>, and you will find an option to duplicate the Screenset.</li>
				<li>You will then see a dialog box that asks which Screenset number you want to copy it to, and it gives you the opportunity to name it, if you like<div id="_idContainer188" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Figure__13.15_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 13.15 – Duplicating a Screenset&#xd;&#xa;" /></div></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.15 – Duplicating a Screenset</p>
			<p>It looks, as you would expect, exactly like the Screenset you duplicated, but it is unlocked. Let&apos;s <a id="_idIndexMarker417"></a>alter this one by filtering out the audio in the Mixer and filtering in the aux and the output, and then lock the Screenset:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer189" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__13.16_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 13.16 – A new Screenset created from a duplicate&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.16 – A new Screenset created from a duplicate</p>
			<p>You can have up to 90 screensets – 1–9, 11–19 (no 10 or 20), and so on. To access 11 or higher, you have to hold down the <strong class="bold">Shift</strong> key and click the two numbers.</p>
			<p>You can import a Screenset, along with other project settings, by going to <strong class="bold">File</strong> | <strong class="bold">Project Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Import Project Settings</strong>. Once there, you will be prompted to point Logic toward the project you wish to import the project settings from and then choose which ones you want to import.</p>
			<p>This <a id="_idIndexMarker418"></a>works fine, but it takes a bit of time, so it is better to save a template with your Screensets, in my opinion.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-194"><a id="_idTextAnchor225"></a>Creating Markers</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Markers</strong> are a great way to get <a id="_idIndexMarker419"></a>around a Logic project, and you can resize their length and move them around easily. So, you should save them in your template. But for this book, I will create them in my project. You can create markers in either the <strong class="bold">Global Tracks</strong> or the <strong class="bold">Marker List</strong> editor. I will do so in the global Marker track.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-195"><a id="_idTextAnchor226"></a>Creating markers in the Marker track</h2>
			<p>Here is my process:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Press <strong class="bold">Option</strong> + <strong class="bold">G</strong> to <a id="_idIndexMarker420"></a>bring up the <strong class="bold">Global Tracks</strong> configuration window and hide all but Marker.</li>
				<li>Click the <strong class="bold">+</strong> sign at the upper right at bar 10 to create <strong class="source-inline">Marker 1</strong>.</li>
				<li>I&apos;m going to create another at bar 5, where my verse begins, and another 
at 22, for my chorus.</li>
				<li>Double-click or use the <strong class="bold">Text</strong> tool to rename <strong class="source-inline">Marker 1</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">Intro</strong>.</li>
				<li>Rename the second Marker to <strong class="source-inline">Verse</strong>, and the third to <strong class="source-inline">Chorus</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Marker Track</strong> now looks like this:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer190" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__13.17_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 13.17 – Beginning to create a Marker Track&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.17 – Beginning to create a Marker Track</p>
			<p>This doesn&apos;t look very inspiring but we will soldier on:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Press <strong class="bold">Option</strong> + <strong class="bold">C</strong> to open the <a id="_idIndexMarker421"></a>color palette and give each track a different color so that they pop.<p class="callout-heading">Note</p><p class="callout">There is now a Display Preference in the <strong class="bold">Tracks</strong> tab to auto-assign colors, but I like to make my own choices. </p></li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Verse</strong> Marker and <strong class="bold">Option</strong> + drag to copy it to bar 35.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Chorus</strong> Marker and <strong class="bold">Option</strong> + drag to copy it to bar 43.<p>Now you know how to copy the markers, and we are getting somewhere, but I like clarity. The second verse is only half as long as the first verse, so I want to rename it.</p></li>
				<li>Double-click on the second <strong class="bold">Verse</strong> Marker and rename it <strong class="source-inline">Verse 2</strong>.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Verse 2</strong> Marker and copy it to bar 56.</li>
				<li>While the chords are those of the verse, it&apos;s a guitar solo, so double-click on this <strong class="bold">Verse</strong> Marker and rename it <strong class="source-inline">Gu</strong><strong class="source-inline">itar Solo</strong>.</li>
				<li>At bar 64, there is a <a id="_idIndexMarker422"></a>bridge, so click the <strong class="bold">+</strong> sign to create another marker, name it <strong class="source-inline">Bridge</strong>, and color it.</li>
				<li>Bar 68 is another chorus. Select the <strong class="bold">Chorus</strong> Marker and copy it to bar 68. </li>
				<li>Bar 77 is the outro, and because I like it to be colored the same as the intro, 
I&apos;ll copy the <strong class="bold">Intro</strong> Marker and rename it <strong class="source-inline">Outro</strong>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>

			<p>OK, those look very pretty, but what do I use them for? I am glad you asked!</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-196"><a id="_idTextAnchor227"></a>Navigating your project with Marker key commands</h2>
			<p>If you press <strong class="bold">Option</strong> + <strong class="bold">K</strong> to open your key commands and in the search file you type the word <strong class="source-inline">Marker</strong>, again you will <a id="_idIndexMarker423"></a>see that there are a bunch of potentially helpful key commands, but the most important two, for me, are assigned, which are <strong class="bold">Go to Previous Marker</strong> and <strong class="bold">Go to Next Marker</strong>. I use these so often that I have assigned them to the <strong class="bold">F5</strong> and <strong class="bold">F6</strong> keys on my computer keyboard:</p>

			<p>In this chapter, we covered using <strong class="bold">Folder Stacks</strong> for less screen clutter, the three views of the Mixer, and how to best utilize them in custom Screensets. We learned all about markers: creating them, coloring them, and using them to navigate our project and create Cycles. We also learned how to edit them. Finally, we learned how to create giant displays of beats and time.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will become familiar with the goals of mixing, discuss considerations, and learn how to use the different categories of plugins to achieve good results.</p>
