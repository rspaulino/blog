			<p>Ever notice that commercial recordings sound pretty different from the computer-based productions you have heard from your friends? That is because they go through a process called mastering. Before we get to that, though, we will need to bounce our mix or possibly send our individual tracks to another mix engineer.</p>
			<p>We will discuss the following topics in this chapter:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Bounce options</li>
				<li>Exporting tracks for mixing outside the project</li>
				<li>Mastering and pre-mastering</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-241"><a id="_idTextAnchor280"></a>Bouncing a stereo mix</h1>
			<p>You have worked really hard on your composition, arranging, and final mix. You are almost ready to send <a id="_idIndexMarker559"></a>your baby out into the world. Or are you? Perhaps you want to send the individual tracks or combinations of them to another engineer.</p>
			<p>Either way, you will first want a stereo mix for yourself, or as a guide to the engineer as to what you are envisioning.</p>
			<p>You may consider, if you have not already, whether or not you want a fade out at the end of the track instead of a more abrupt ending. Fade outs can be quite long or quite short, depending on how you want it to sound.</p>
			<p>In the following screenshot, you can see that for this song, I automated the stereo output to do a very short fade:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer259" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__16.1_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 16.1 – A short automated fade out&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.1 – A short automated fade out</p>
			<p>The stereo output will be added to the bottom of the track list if you either assign it to an automation mode, or in the Mixer, you select it and go under the <strong class="bold">Options</strong> menu and choose <strong class="bold">Create Tracks</strong>, or press <strong class="bold">Ctrl</strong> + <strong class="bold">T</strong> on your computer keyboard for <strong class="bold">Selected Channel Strips</strong>. Once it is <a id="_idIndexMarker560"></a>there, it will remain at the bottom of the track list. Presently, Logic does not give you the option to move it up in the track list.</p>
			<p>Alternatively, go under the <strong class="bold">Track</strong> menu and select <strong class="bold">Output Track</strong>, or press 
<strong class="bold">Shift</strong> + <strong class="bold">Co</strong><strong class="bold">mmand</strong> + <strong class="bold">M</strong>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-242"><a id="_idTextAnchor281"></a>Opening the Bounce window</h2>
			<p>Again, Logic gives you <a id="_idIndexMarker561"></a>several ways to get to the window where you will choose your options:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Navigate to <strong class="bold">File</strong> | <strong class="bold">Bounce</strong> | <strong class="bold">Project</strong> or <strong class="bold">Section</strong>.</li>
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">Co</strong><strong class="bold">mmand</strong> + <strong class="bold">B</strong>.</li>
				<li>On the <strong class="bold">Stereo</strong> <strong class="bold">Output</strong> channel strip, click on <strong class="bold">Bnce</strong> (no, that isn&apos;t short for Beyoncé).</li>
			</ol>
			<p>By now, you know that I am going to use the key command, and when I do, the following window opens up:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer260" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__16.2_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 16.2: The Bounce window with an incorrect bounce length&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.2: The Bounce window with an incorrect bounce length</p>
			<p>There is much <a id="_idIndexMarker562"></a>to learn about in this window, but right away, I see a problem with the length of the bounce. My project is over 80 bars long, but Logic seems to think I only want to bounce a section of it. That is because I had a region selected in the Tracks area when I pressed <strong class="bold">Co</strong><strong class="bold">mmand</strong> + <strong class="bold">B</strong>.</p>
			<p>No problem, I deselect the region by clicking in a blank part of the Tracks area 
and again press <strong class="bold">Command</strong> + <strong class="bold">B</strong>. Whaaattt? Now Logic thinks my project is 168 measures long?</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer261" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__16.3_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 16.3 – The Bounce window with another incorrect bounce length&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.3 – The Bounce window with another incorrect bounce length</p>
			<p>There are a <a id="_idIndexMarker563"></a>couple of ways to prevent this from ever happening. One is to customize your Control bar to include <strong class="bold">Key Signature / Project End</strong> under the <strong class="bold">LCD</strong> column and make it one of your defaults:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer262" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__16.4_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 16.4: Adding Key Signature/Project End to the Control Bar&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.4: Adding Key Signature/Project End to the Control Bar</p>
			<p>Now, you can double-click <a id="_idIndexMarker564"></a>on the number of bars and type in the correct amount – in my case, <strong class="source-inline">88</strong> bars. But there is an easier way:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Press <strong class="bold">Command</strong>  + <strong class="bold">A</strong> to select all the regions.</li>
				<li>Press <strong class="bold">U</strong> to create a Cycle that conforms to the length of all the regions.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now, when you open the <strong class="bold">Bounce</strong> window, it will be correct:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer263" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__16.5_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 16.5 – The Bounce window with the correct bounce length&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-243"><a id="_idTextAnchor282"></a>PCM file formats</h2>
			<p>Under the <strong class="bold">Destination</strong> menu, the <a id="_idIndexMarker565"></a>first checkbox is for <strong class="bold">PCM</strong>, which stands for <strong class="bold">pulse code modulation</strong>. PCMs are high-quality audio files that you use to burn onto a CD or DVD or to give the best quality. If you hold the mouse down on the file format, you see three choices: <strong class="bold">AIFF</strong>, <strong class="bold">Wave</strong>, and <strong class="bold">CAF</strong>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer264" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__16.6_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 16.6 – PCM file formats&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.6 – PCM file formats</p>
			<p>Many years ago, Macs used Sound Designer II files and PCs used Wave files, and they were not compatible. Apple realized that there were a lot more PC users than Mac users and created the <strong class="bold">Audio Interchange File Format</strong>, <strong class="bold">AIFF</strong>, a cross-platform format. Eventually, <strong class="bold">Wave</strong> files became <strong class="bold">Broadcast</strong> <strong class="bold">Wave</strong> files and they too were cross-platform.</p>
			<p>So, which <a id="_idIndexMarker566"></a>should you use? Which one sounds better?</p>
			<p>Neither, the sound is the same; they simply write their header information differently. I recommend getting in the habit of using <strong class="bold">Wave</strong> because it has become an industry standard.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">CAF</strong> stands for <strong class="bold">Core Audio Format</strong> and was designed for storage, so you can forget about it for our purposes.</p>
			<p>If you now examine the <strong class="bold">Resolution</strong> field, you have a choice of <strong class="bold">8</strong>-, <strong class="bold">16</strong>-, <strong class="bold">24</strong>-, or <strong class="bold">32</strong>-bit float. CDs and DVDs use <strong class="bold">16</strong>-bit, but <strong class="bold">24</strong>-bit is a lot more resolution, and when you burn it onto a CD or DVD, any app you use to do so will convert it down to 16-bit, so I recommend sticking with that. <strong class="bold">32</strong>-bit float is great for when you want to preserve the best quality, but many other programs will not let you import <strong class="bold">32</strong>-bit float audio files.</p>
			<p>The next field is for the <strong class="bold">Sample Rate</strong> selection, which we discussed back in <a href="B16394_03_Final_Apple_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor052"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Record</em><em class="italic">ing Audio</em>.</p>
			<p>There is no sonic improvement in up-sampling from where your project audio was recorded. You cannot add bits that are not there. So, if you recorded at <strong class="bold">44.1</strong>, stay at <strong class="bold">44.1</strong> unless it is going to DVD or a video editing program, in which case you want to choose <strong class="bold">48</strong>.</p>
			<p>In the <strong class="bold">File Type</strong> field, there are only two choices: <strong class="bold">Split</strong> and the default, <strong class="bold">Interleaved</strong>. Unless an engineer specifically requests separate left and right sides of a stereo audio file, there is no reason for you not to always choose <strong class="bold">In</strong><strong class="bold">terleaved</strong>.</p>
			<p>Now we come to <strong class="bold">Dithering</strong>. Dithering is a more complicated subject. Most pros will tell you that when you are going to use a lower bit rate, you should always use dither and that Power-4-#1 will <a id="_idIndexMarker567"></a>usually be the best choice. Many CD-burning programs include dithering as an option, but with fewer choices. Here, we started at 24-bit and are bouncing to 24-bit, so we don&apos;t need it, but if you know for sure that you are going to burn it onto a CD, you might want to do a second bounce at 16-bit with dithering.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-244"><a id="_idTextAnchor283"></a>MP3s and M4As</h2>
			<p>MP3s are a ubiquitous compressed audio file format. Their chief virtue is that they are small in size and <a id="_idIndexMarker568"></a>therefore easy to share on social media and through email, and are good if you do a lot of listening on your <a id="_idIndexMarker569"></a>phone, which has limited storage. A Google search will tell you that it is possible to have high-quality MP3s.</p>
			<p>At the risk of again being the cranky old pro, I am going to tell you that they do not sound very good, even at their highest quality. The compression creates sizzle and distortion, and a lot of the subtle sonic information gets lost.</p>
			<p>That said, yes, they have their purpose, and I know you are going to use them. You can create them instead of PCM files or in addition to them. If both are checked, Logic will first bounce the <strong class="bold">PCM</strong> and then immediately bounce an <strong class="bold">MP3</strong>.</p>
			<p>I recommend that you check <strong class="bold">Use Variable Bit Rate Encoding (VBR)</strong> with <strong class="bold">Quality</strong> set to <strong class="bold">Highest</strong>, and check <strong class="bold">Use best encoding</strong> and <strong class="bold">Filter frequencies be</strong><strong class="bold">low 10 Hz</strong>.</p>
			<p>Checking <strong class="bold">Add to Music</strong> will add it to the Apple Music app&apos;s library, formerly iTunes:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer265" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__16.7_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 16.7 – MP3 settings&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.7 – MP3 settings</p>
			<p>M4A, also known as Apple Lossless, is <a id="_idIndexMarker570"></a>another compressed format, developed by Apple. It definitely sounds <a id="_idIndexMarker571"></a>considerably better than MP3 but is <a id="_idIndexMarker572"></a>not even close to being used as universally, so for now, we will pass on further discussion of it.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-245"><a id="_idTextAnchor284"></a>Realtime versus offline</h2>
			<p>Realtime means <a id="_idIndexMarker573"></a>just that, the bounce happens in real time and you hear it. Offline happens faster, although with third-party DSP plugins, such as those from Universal Audio, it can bounce more slowly, and you don&apos;t hear it.</p>
			<p>They both have their advantages. If I have recorded a 45-minute voiceover for someone, I sure as heck don&apos;t want to sit there for 45 minutes and listen while it bounces. Also, if my computer is struggling with CPU issues, it sometimes will get you past the system overload messages.</p>
			<p>Most of the time, however, I do want to do a real-time bounce, because when I sit back in my chair and just listen, I sometimes notice things I did not notice while I was mixing.</p>
			<p>You cannot make adjustments while a mix is bouncing. Pressing <strong class="bold">Command</strong> + <strong class="bold">period</strong> stops the process so that you can make the adjustments you wish to make and then resume bouncing.</p>
			<p>We also see the options of <strong class="bold">Bounce 2nd Cycle Pass</strong> and <strong class="bold">Include A</strong><strong class="bold">udio Tail</strong>.</p>
			<p>Apple says &quot;in certain situations, you may want to hear a region&apos;s FX tail at the start of the bounce. In a one cycle pass, the FX tail will not be recorded because the bounce will have already finished. By recording the final bounce at the start of the second pass, the first pass&apos; FX tail will also be included.&quot; Personally, I never use it.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Include Audio Tail</strong> is an <a id="_idIndexMarker574"></a>option to include processing, such as delays and reverb, which takes place after the song ends. I don&apos;t use it because some plugins cause the bounce to be much longer than necessary. If I hear the audio tail being prematurely cut off, I think extending the length of the Cycle a bar or two longer is a better solution.</p>
			<p>We discussed <strong class="bold">Normalize</strong> in <a href="B16394_12_Final_Apple_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor193"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></a>, <em class="italic">Getting the Arrangement Right</em>. Friends don&apos;t let friends normalize. Don&apos;t do it.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-246"><a id="_idTextAnchor285"></a>Exporting tracks to send to a mix engineer</h1>
			<p>If you have a project where you feel you cannot do the mix justice and have the resources to <a id="_idIndexMarker575"></a>hire an engineer, they may not work in Logic Pro X or may not have the same software instruments and sample libraries that <a id="_idIndexMarker576"></a>you do, so you will need to export the tracks to send to them. The process was fully explained in <a href="B16394_12_Final_Apple_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor193"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></a>, <em class="italic">Getting the Arrangement Right</em>, so I will not reiterate it here.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-247"><a id="_idTextAnchor286"></a>Mastering your mix</h1>
			<p>Mastering is the final <a id="_idIndexMarker577"></a>step in preparing recordings for commercial release. Mastering engineers typically do the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Eliminate pops and clicks and other noise flaws.</li>
				<li>Adjust the volumes between songs for consistency so that listeners do not have to keep turning the volume up and down when listening to an album.</li>
				<li>Adjust the volume so that the loudness conforms to the standards of the intended playback medium (streaming services, CDs, and so on).</li>
				<li>Adjust the EQ and width of the songs, and apply compression or expansion.</li>
				<li>Arrange the songs&apos; order and add fade outs, where required.</li>
				<li>Insert ISRC codes and CD text.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-248"><a id="_idTextAnchor287"></a>The changed role of the mastering engineer</h2>
			<p>Mastering engineers were considered an elite class of engineers. They had very specific knowledge of how the grooves on vinyl records worked and often thousands of dollars of analog gear to <a id="_idIndexMarker578"></a>master with, which they knew really well. They were considered essential by record labels and artists, and the famous ones, such as Bernie Grundman, Doug Sax, and Bob Katz, were paid a lot of money for their expertise.</p>
			<p>While vinyl is now coming back to a degree, for most recordings, how it works on vinyl is no longer a priority. Because when we hear music louder, we think it sounds better, today&apos;s mastering engineers are having to deal, mostly, with trying to make the music as loud as possible, often to the point of almost eliminating dynamic range. Those who have been doing this a long while are not thrilled, but they have to answer to their clients, so they do.</p>
			<p>Also, in this era, they may be using mostly, or even exclusively, high-quality digital plugins to master, rather than analog gear.</p>
			<p>Of course, they still do the other things mentioned earlier as well. It was a source of pride for me, as you know that I don&apos;t consider myself a &quot;real&quot; engineer, that when I gave a mastering engineer the tracks for my album <em class="italic">Honestly</em>, he said that he really didn&apos;t have to do very much because I had done a good job of level matching and mixing. That said, his finished versions did sound noticeably better to me.</p>
			<p>If you are your own engineer sending mixes to a mastering engineer, generally you want not to add much processing to the stereo output and leave the mixes peaking at -6 dB, so that they have some headroom to work with, especially if they are using analog gear. But they are pros and will deal with what you give them.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-249"><a id="_idTextAnchor288"></a>Can you master your own tracks in Logic Pro X?</h2>
			<p>In theory, sure. Logic Pro X comes with some very good plugins for this purpose. That said, we all probably have heard the statement that an attorney who is representing himself has a fool for a client.</p>
			<p>This applies here. You do not know and won&apos;t for a long time, if ever, all that a mastering engineer knows. There are some very good and affordable mastering engineers, so if you are aiming for a commercial release, you need to budget for one. If you are going to only <a id="_idIndexMarker579"></a>distribute on the internet, though, and you want it to sound as good as it can but cannot afford a mastering engineer, you can do what I prefer to think of as pre-mastering in Logic Pro.</p>
			<p>The easiest way to begin to learn how is to use the collections of plugins that you find in the <strong class="bold">Channel Strip</strong> settings for the stereo output. Hold the mouse down at the very top of the <strong class="bold">Stereo Output</strong> channel strip and scroll down to the <strong class="bold">Factory</strong> presets intended for mastering:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer266" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure__16.8_B16394.jpg" alt="Figure 16.8 – Factory mastering presets&#xd;&#xa;" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.8 – Factory mastering presets</p>
			<p>If you load <strong class="bold">Broadcast Ready</strong>, you see that it adds a Compressor, a Linear Phase 
EQ, a Multipressor (multiband compressor), a bypassed Exciter, and finally, an Adaptive Li<a id="_idTextAnchor289"></a>miter:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer267" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.9 – The Broadcast Ready mastering preset</p>
			<p>If you play back your project and bypass each plugin and then make them active as you are playing back, you will learn a lot. You can, of course, change the settings and hear how the sound changes.</p>
			<p>Switch to <strong class="bold">Hip Hop</strong> and you will <a id="_idIndexMarker580"></a>see a different combination of plugins with different settings, and you will hear quite a change in the sound:</p>

				</div>

			<p>We are done!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-250"><a id="_idTextAnchor290"></a>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we covered all the file formats available for bouncing, as well as other options. We mentioned the information for exporting tracks, which was discussed in <a href="B16394_12_Final_Apple_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor193"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></a><em class="italic">, Getting the Arrangement Right,</em> and ended with a discussion of mastering and what I like to refer to as pre-mastering.</p>
			<p>I hope you will find this book helpful as you begin your relationship with Logic Pro X. As with all good relationships, it requires a substantial investment in time and real commitment, but the rewards are really great! </p>
			<p>Logic Pro X is incredibly deep, and new features are being constantly added, so it grows even deeper. I have been using Logic since 1.0 in 1993, and I am still constantly learning more about it in my daily work.</p>
			<p>Good luck, and have fun with Logic Pro X.</p>
