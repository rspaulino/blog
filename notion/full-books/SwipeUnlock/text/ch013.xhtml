Emerging Markets</h1>
<p>Let’s start our exploration of the world of technology by looking under the hood of the apps you use every day. Netflix and Microsoft Excel might feel pretty different, but they’re both made from the same building blocks. In fact, we’d argue that every app is made from these same building blocks. What are they? Read on.</p>
<section id="how-does-google-search-work-3" class="level2" data-number="12.1">
<h2 data-number="12.1">How does Google search work?</h2>
<p>Whenever you search on Google, the search engine combs through the over 30 trillion webpages on the internet and finds the top 10 results for your question.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" epub:type="noteref">1</a> 92% of the time, you’ll click on a result on the first page (that is, among the top 10 results).<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" epub:type="noteref">2</a> Finding the top 10 things out of 30 trillion is really hard — it’s about as hard as trying to find a penny randomly dropped somewhere in New York City.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" epub:type="noteref">3</a> Yet Google does this expertly and in just half a second, on average.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" epub:type="noteref">4</a> But how?</p>
<p>Google doesn’t actually visit every page on the internet every time you ask it something. Google actually stores information about webpages in databases (tables of information, like in Excel), and it uses algorithms that read those databases to decide what to show you. Algorithms are just series of instructions — humans might have an “algorithm” to make a PB&amp;J sandwich, while Google’s computers have algorithms to find webpages based on what you typed into the search bar.</p>
<section id="crawling-3" class="level3" data-number="12.1.1">
<h3 data-number="12.1.1">Crawling</h3>
<p>Google’s algorithm starts by building a database of every webpage on the internet. Google uses programs called spiders to “crawl” over webpages until it’s found all of them (or at least, what Google thinks is all of them). The spiders start on a few webpages and add those to Google’s list of pages, called the “<em>index</em>.” Then, the spiders follow all the outgoing links on those pages and find a new set of pages, which they add to the index. Next, they follow all the links on <em>those</em> pages, and so on, until Google can’t find anything else.</p>
<p>This process is always ongoing; Google is always adding new pages to its index or updating pages when they change. The index is huge, weighing in at over 100 million gigabytes.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" epub:type="noteref">5</a> If you tried to fit that on one-terabyte external hard drives, you’d need 100,000 — which, if you stacked them up, would be around a mile high.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" epub:type="noteref">6</a></p>
</section>
<section id="word-search-3" class="level3" data-number="12.1.2">
<h3 data-number="12.1.2">Word search</h3>
<p>When you search Google, it grabs your query (the text you typed into the search bar) and looks through its index to find the webpages that are most relevant.</p>
<p>How might Google do this? The simplest way would be to just look for occurrences of a particular keyword, kind of like hitting Ctrl+F or Cmd+F to search a giant Word document. Indeed, this is how search engines in the 90’s used to work: they’d search for your query in their index and show the pages that had the most matches,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" epub:type="noteref">7</a> an attribute called keyword density.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" epub:type="noteref">8</a></p>
<p>This turned out to be pretty easy to game. If you searched for the candy bar Snickers, you’d imagine that snickers.com would be the first hit. But if a search engine just counted the number of times the word “snickers” appeared on a webpage, anyone could make a random page that just said “snickers snickers snickers snickers” (and so on) and jump to the top of the search results. Clearly, that’s not very useful.</p>
</section>
<section id="pagerank-3" class="level3" data-number="12.1.3">
<h3 data-number="12.1.3">PageRank</h3>
<p>Instead of keyword density, Google’s core innovation is an algorithm called PageRank, which its founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin created for their PhD thesis in 1998.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" epub:type="noteref">9</a> Page and Brin noticed that you can estimate a webpage’s importance by looking at which other important pages link to them.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" epub:type="noteref">10</a> It’s like how, at a party, you know someone is popular when they’re surrounded by <em>other</em> popular people. PageRank gives each webpage a score that’s based on the PageRank scores of every other page that links to that page.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" epub:type="noteref">11</a> (The scores of <em>those</em> pages depend on the pages that link to them, and so on; this gets calculated with linear algebra.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" epub:type="noteref">12</a>)</p>
<p>For instance, if we made a brand-new webpage about Abraham Lincoln, it would initially have very low PageRank. If some obscure blog added a link to our page, our page would get a small boost to its PageRank. PageRank cares more about the quality of incoming links rather than the quantity,<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" epub:type="noteref">13</a> so even if dozens of obscure blogs linked to our page, we wouldn’t gain much. But if a New York Times article (which probably has a high PageRank) linked to our page, our page would get a huge PageRank boost.</p>
<p>Once Google finds all the pages in its index that mention your search query, it ranks them using several criteria, including PageRank.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" epub:type="noteref">14</a> Google has many other criteria as well: it considers how recently a webpage was updated, ignores websites that look spammy (like the “snickers snickers snickers snickers” site we mentioned earlier), considers your location (it could return the NFL if you search for “football” in the US, but the English Premier League if you search for “football” in England), and more.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" epub:type="noteref">15</a></p>
</section>
<section id="gaming-google-3" class="level3" data-number="12.1.4">
<h3 data-number="12.1.4">Gaming Google?</h3>
<p>There are pitfalls to PageRank, however. Much like spammers abused keyword density (as with “snickers snickers snickers snickers”), spammers have now started making “link farms,” or webpages that contain tons of unrelated links. Website owners can pay link farms to include a link to their webpages, which would artificially boost their PageRank.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" epub:type="noteref">16</a> However, Google has gotten pretty good at catching and ignoring link farms.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" epub:type="noteref">17</a></p>
<p>There are some more mainstream ways to game Google, though. An entire industry, called search engine optimization (SEO), has sprung up to help website owners crack Google’s search algorithm and make sure their webpages appear at the top of Google searches.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" epub:type="noteref">18</a> The most basic form of SEO is getting more pages to link to your page. SEO includes plenty more techniques, such as putting the right keywords in your page’s title and headings or making all of your site’s pages link to each other.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" epub:type="noteref">19</a></p>
<p>Google’s search algorithm is always changing, though; Google rolls out minor updates over 500 times a year.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" epub:type="noteref">20</a> There are occasionally more major updates, and after each, SEO experts try to find ways to use the changes to get ahead. For instance, Google changed its algorithm in 2018 to favor websites that loaded faster on mobile devices, leading experts to suggest that website owners make stripped-down articles with a Google tool called Accelerated Mobile Pages, or AMP.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" epub:type="noteref">21</a></p>

<section id="how-does-spotify-recommend-songs-to-you-3" class="level2" data-number="12.2">
<h2 data-number="12.2">How does Spotify recommend songs to you?</h2>
<p>Every Monday morning, Spotify sends its listeners a playlist of 30 songs that are, almost magically, perfectly tuned to their tastes. This playlist, called Discover Weekly, was an instant hit: within six months of launching in June 2015, it was streamed over 1.7 billion times.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" epub:type="noteref">22</a> But how does Spotify get to know its 200 million users so intimately?<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" epub:type="noteref">23</a></p>
<p>Spotify does employ music experts who hand-curate public playlists,<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" epub:type="noteref">24</a> but there’s no way they could do that for all 200 million Spotify users. Instead, Spotify has turned to an algorithm they run every week.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" epub:type="noteref">25</a></p>
<p>The Discover Weekly algorithm starts by looking at two basic pieces of information. First, it looks at all the songs you’ve listened to and liked enough to add to your library or playlists. It’s even smart enough to know that if you skipped a song within the first 30 seconds, you probably didn’t like it. Second, it looks at all the playlists that other people have made, with the assumption that every playlist has some thematic connection; for instance, you could have a “running” playlist or a “Beatles jam” playlist.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" epub:type="noteref">26</a></p>
<p><img src="../media/file1.jpg" style="width:3.29in;height:4.9992in" alt="STU Book Graphics_Page_1.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>Spotify’s algorithm for automatically recommending songs for you. Source: Quartz</em><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" epub:type="noteref">27</a></p>
<p>Once it has this data, Spotify uses two methods to find songs you might like. The first method involves comparing the two datasets to figure out which new songs are related to the ones you like. For instance, suppose someone made a playlist with eight songs on it, and seven of those are in your library. You probably like this type of song, so Discover Weekly might recommend the one song that isn’t in your library.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" epub:type="noteref">28</a></p>
<p>This technique is called “collaborative filtering,” and it’s the same technique that Amazon uses to suggest items you might like based on your purchase history and the purchases of millions of other users.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" epub:type="noteref">29</a> Netflix’s movie suggestions, YouTube’s video suggestions, and Facebook’s friend suggestions also use collaborative filtering.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" epub:type="noteref">30</a></p>
<p>Collaborative filtering gets more and more useful as a service gets more users — in this case, when there are more Spotify users, it’s easier to find someone with similar tastes to a particular person, and hence easier to make a recommendation. But these algorithms can get slow and computationally-intensive as their user base grows, too.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" epub:type="noteref">31</a></p>
<p>The second method that Spotify uses to make your playlist is your “taste profile.” Based on just the songs you’ve listened to and liked, Spotify will determine which genres (e.g. indie rock or R&amp;B) and micro-genres (e.g. chamber pop or New Americana) you like and recommend songs from those genres. It’s just a different form of their strategy for recommending songs based on past listening patterns.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" epub:type="noteref">32</a></p>
<section id="why-invest-in-music-recommendation-3" class="level3" data-number="12.2.1">
<h3 data-number="12.2.1">Why invest in music recommendation?</h3>
<p>Hiring all the engineers to build this recommendation engine is expensive, though — Spotify engineers make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" epub:type="noteref">33</a> So why does Spotify do it?</p>
<p>First, a great recommendation system is a selling point, helping Spotify stand out from rivals like Apple Music. That’s because just having a huge music library isn’t enough. In business terms, music is a commodity — any song sounds more or less the same whether it’s on Spotify or Apple Music or anything else — and anyone with enough money can get the licenses to build a giant library.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" epub:type="noteref">34</a></p>
<p>So, if all the music streaming services can have effectively the same selection of music, Spotify needs something to differentiate itself from competitors. And Spotify’s recommendation system certainly fits the bill — it’s widely considered better than Apple Music’s.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" epub:type="noteref">35</a></p>
<p>And since collaborative filtering gets better with more users, Spotify (which already has tons of users) can continue furthering its lead.</p>
<p>The second reason is that personalized recommendations make users more likely to stick with the service.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" epub:type="noteref">36</a> The more you use Spotify, the more the algorithms know about your tastes, and hence the better they can recommend music to you. So if you use Spotify a lot, your recommendations would be pretty good, and you’d lose a lot by jumping to Apple Music, which doesn’t know you at all. So this high “switching cost” makes you less likely to jump. (More generally, any personal data you put into an app — like making Spotify playlists — raises the switching cost, since you’d have to recreate that data in any new app you jumped to.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" epub:type="noteref">37</a>)</p>
<p>In short, personalized playlists are great for listeners and a savvy business move for Spotify — no wonder more and more apps are offering personalized recommendations.</p>

<section id="how-does-facebook-decide-what-shows-up-in-your-news-feed-3" class="level2" data-number="12.3">
<h2 data-number="12.3">How does Facebook decide what shows up in your news feed?</h2>
<p>Over a billion people look at their Facebook news feed every day, and Americans spend almost as much time on Facebook as they do interacting face-to-face with other people.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" epub:type="noteref">38</a> Because it draws so many eyeballs, the news feed has tremendous power. The news feed can influence our mood, put us in an ideological echo chambers,<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" epub:type="noteref">39</a> or even influence who we’re going to vote for.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" epub:type="noteref">40</a> In short, what appears in your news feed matters. So how does Facebook decide what to show in your news feed?</p>
<p><img src="../media/file2.jpg" style="width:4in;height:2.36495in" alt="STU Book Graphics_Page_2.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>A simplified explanation of Facebook’s news feed algorithm. Source: TechCrunch</em><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" epub:type="noteref">41</a></p>
<p>More specifically, how does Facebook take the hundreds (or thousands) of updates you get every day and sort them for you? Like Google, it uses an algorithm to figure out what’s most important. There are about 100,000 personalized factors, but we’ll focus on four key ones.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" epub:type="noteref">42</a></p>
<p>The first factor is who posted it. Facebook will show you more posts from people you’ve interacted with more (e.g. people you’ve messaged more or tagged more), with the assumption that you’re more likely to engage with their future posts.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" epub:type="noteref">43</a></p>
<p>Second is the post’s quality. The more people have engaged (e.g. liked or commented) with a post, the more interesting Facebook thinks it is, so the more likely it is to appear at the top of your news feed.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" epub:type="noteref">44</a></p>
<p>Third, the type of post. Facebook figures out what kinds of posts (videos, articles, photos, etc.) you interact with a lot and shows you more of those.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" epub:type="noteref">45</a></p>
<p>The fourth major factor is “recency”: newer stories get ranked higher.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46" epub:type="noteref">46</a></p>
<p>There are plenty more factors, though. TIME found a few:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use a phone with a slow mobile connection and you may see less video. Writing ‘congratulations’ in a comment signals the post is probably about a big life event, so it will get a boost. Liking an article after you clicked it is a stronger positive signal than liking before, since it means you probably read the piece and enjoyed it.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" epub:type="noteref">47</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can tell, Facebook really tries to maximize the probability that you’re going to like or comment on the posts in your news feed, a metric called engagement. After all, the more you like your news feed, the more you’re going to scroll down, and the more you scroll down, the more ads you’ll see. Ads, of course, are how Facebook makes most of its money.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" epub:type="noteref">48</a></p>
<p><img src="../media/file3.jpg" style="width:4in;height:2.25641in" alt="STU Book Graphics_Page_3.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>An example of how Facebook ranks posts and determines what appears on your news feed. Source: TechCrunch</em><a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49" epub:type="noteref">49</a></p>
<p><em>This algorithm also trains users to act in ways that help Facebook. Everyone wants their posts to show up atop their friends’ news feeds, and since Facebook boosts viral posts, people are incentivized to make posts that get shared a lot.</em><a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50" epub:type="noteref">50</a> <em>More sharing on Facebook leads to more posts, which means Facebook can slot in more ads.</em></p>
<section id="fighting-fake-news-3" class="level3" data-number="12.3.1">
<h3 data-number="12.3.1">Fighting fake news</h3>
<p>Algorithms like Facebook’s news feed algorithm are incredibly powerful, but the danger is that they’re still easy for crafty hackers to game. With no human oversight, the algorithms could be turned against us.</p>
<p>A famous example is the fake news epidemic that swept Facebook during the 2016 American presidential election.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" epub:type="noteref">51</a> Recall that the news feed algorithm doesn’t consider how true or reputable a post is; it only cares about maximizing engagement.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" epub:type="noteref">52</a> Fake newsmongers took advantage of this to attack politicians they didn’t like, posting outrageous and demonstrably false news articles around Facebook. These articles naturally drew many clicks and comments, so Facebook’s news feed algorithm propelled them to the top of many people’s news feeds.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" epub:type="noteref">53</a></p>
<p>To Facebook’s credit, it’s since rolled out updates to its news feed algorithm to try to limit the spread of fake news. In 2018, Facebook announced it would change its algorithm to focus on “meaningful social interactions,” meaning it would promote updates from your friends instead of just feeding you news stories. As Facebook admitted, though, measuring “meaningful social interactions” is far harder than just measuring likes and clicks on articles.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54" epub:type="noteref">54</a></p>
<p>Facebook has also been turning to humans to address the flaws in its news feed algorithm. (Ironic, since algorithms are designed to reduce the amount of work humans have to do in the first place, but it acknowledges that algorithms aren’t perfect.) For instance, Facebook has introduced features that let people flag fake news posts,<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55" epub:type="noteref">55</a> and it’s started hiring focus groups that scroll through their news feeds and give feedback to the people who design the news feed algorithm.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56" epub:type="noteref">56</a> (That’s right, you <em>can</em> get paid to browse Facebook.)</p>
<p>Algorithms aren’t magic spells that run the world. They’re just sets of rules (though complex ones) that other people wrote to make computers do a particular task. And, as Facebook shows, sometimes machines and people need to work together.</p>

<section id="what-technologies-do-uber-yelp-and-pokémon-go-have-in-common-3" class="level2" data-number="12.4">
<h2 data-number="12.4">What technologies do Uber, Yelp, and Pokémon Go have in common?</h2>
<p>Suppose you wanted to make your own version of Google Maps. You’d have to track every road, building, city, and shoreline on the planet. You might even need a fleet of cars to drive around the world and take pictures and measurements, as Google has done for Google Maps.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57" epub:type="noteref">57</a> And you’d also need to build in panning, zooming, and algorithms to find driving directions between two points.</p>
<p>That is, to put it mildly, very difficult. Even Apple Maps has been criticized for not reaching Google Maps’ standard of quality.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58" epub:type="noteref">58</a></p>
<p>So when apps like Uber, Pokémon Go, and Yelp need to include a map to show where available cars are, help players, find wild Pokémon, or display nearby restaurants, they probably do not want to spend billions of dollars and thousands of hours building their own maps.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever used these apps, you can probably figure out what they do instead: they embed a Google Map in their app. Searching up restaurants? Yelp drops pins on a Google Map centered on your location. Want to Uber downtown? The app draws the route you’ll take on a Google Map and calculates the approximate time it’ll take to get there.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59" epub:type="noteref">59</a></p>
<p>Google lets you include a small snippet of code in your app to draw a Google Map. It also provides other snippets of code to let you draw on the maps, calculate driving directions between points on the map, and even find out the speed limit for a particular road. All these tools are cheap or even free.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60" epub:type="noteref">60</a> These tools are big win for developers; they can use the technology that has taken Google years to perfect with just a small amount of code. There’s no need to reinvent the wheel!</p>
<p><img src="../media/file4.png" style="width:2.7in;height:5in" alt="A close up of a map Description automatically generated" /></p>
<p><em>Uber uses the Google Maps API to draw a map of your area and predict your car’s travel time. Source: Uber on Android</em></p>
<p>These snippets of code that let you borrow another app’s functionality or data are called APIs, or application programming interfaces. In short, APIs let apps talk to each other. Let’s look at three main kinds of APIs.</p>
<section id="three-kinds-of-apis-3" class="level3" data-number="12.4.1">
<h3 data-number="12.4.1">Three kinds of APIs</h3>
<p>The first kind of API, which we’ll call “feature APIs,” lets one app ask another specialized app to solve a particular problem, like calculating driving directions, sending text messages, or translating sentences. It’s like how you could call a plumber or carpenter to fix problems around your house instead of trying to do it yourself. Apps use all kinds of feature APIs. It’s a pain to write code that sends emails or text messages, so when apps like Venmo need to send confirmation emails or texts, they’ll just use a specialized API.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61" epub:type="noteref">61</a> Processing credit card payments is pretty difficult, so Uber outsources this to PayPal’s Braintree API,<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62" epub:type="noteref">62</a> which lets anyone use PayPal’s credit card-processing algorithm with just a few lines of code.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63" epub:type="noteref">63</a></p>
<p>The second type of API, which we’ll call “data APIs,” lets one app ask another app to hand over some interesting information, such as sports scores, recent Tweets, or today’s weather. It’s like calling the front desk at a hotel to learn which museums and restaurants they recommend. ESPN offers an API that lets you get rosters for every major-league sports team and scores for every game.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64" epub:type="noteref">64</a> New York’s subway system lets you track where trains are and predict when the next train will arrive at a station.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65" epub:type="noteref">65</a> There’s even an API to get random images of cats.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66" epub:type="noteref">66</a></p>
<p>The final kind of API, “hardware APIs,” lets developers access features of the device itself. Instagram taps into your phone’s Camera API to zoom, focus, and snap photos. Google Maps itself uses your phone’s Geolocation API to figure out where in the world you are. Your phone even has sensors called accelerometers and gyroscopes, which fitness apps use to determine which direction you’re walking and how fast you’re moving.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67" epub:type="noteref">67</a></p>
<p>It’s worth noting that APIs aren’t perfect. Using an API makes app developers’ lives easier, but it also makes their apps dependent on the API.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68" epub:type="noteref">68</a> If an email-sending API went down, every app that used it would be unable to send emails. And if Google decided to launch its own ridesharing service, it could — in theory — restrict Uber’s access to the Google Maps API to weaken the competition. If Uber built its own mapping service, it wouldn’t be at Google’s mercy.</p>
<p>Despite the potential business risks, using a specialized company’s API is easier, more reliable, and often cheaper than trying to build it yourself.</p>
<p>All this brings us back to the question: what technologies do Uber, Yelp, and Pokémon Go have in common? They all use APIs, namely the Google Maps API, to avoid reinventing the wheel. Indeed, APIs are a core part of pretty much every app out there.</p>

<p><em>Tinder on Android. Note that you have to log in with Facebook.</em></p>
<p>If you’ve ever used the dating app Tinder, you’ll notice that you can log in with your Facebook account before setting up a profile. Once you connect your Facebook profile, Tinder imports information like your profile picture, your age, your list of friends, and the Facebook pages you like.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69" epub:type="noteref">69</a> As you might have guessed, this is done through an API that Facebook offers. With this single sign-on (SSO) API, any app can let users create accounts by linking their Facebook profiles.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70" epub:type="noteref">70</a></p>
<p>Why does Tinder use this API? For one, it ensures that there are no empty profiles (which no one would want to swipe on) since some basic information always gets imported from Facebook.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71" epub:type="noteref">71</a> Second, requiring Facebook login helps them stop bots and fake accounts, since Facebook already does a lot of work to shut these down.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72" epub:type="noteref">72</a> Third, this helps Tinder make better matches: by gathering your friend list, Tinder can show you how many mutual friends you have with each potential match, and that sense of connection probably encourages people to swipe more. Finally, by getting the Facebook profiles of all their users, Tinder can get some deep insights into their user base, such as how old they are, where they live, or what they’re interested in.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73" epub:type="noteref">73</a> These insights can help Tinder tweak its app’s design or advertising strategies.</p>
<p>Signing up with Facebook is also helpful for users. Making your profile with Tinder becomes much faster when most of your basic information and pictures are already imported from Facebook.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74" epub:type="noteref">74</a> Seeing more completed profiles and fewer bots improves your experience, as well.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75" epub:type="noteref">75</a> And signing up with Facebook means you don’t have to remember yet another username and password.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76" epub:type="noteref">76</a></p>
<p>Why would Facebook publish the API that lets people sign in to other websites using their Facebook credentials? Well, when you use Facebook’ single sign-on (SSO) API to register for Tinder, Facebook realizes that you’re a Tinder user. Facebook gets similar data points when you use Facebook to log into other websites. Facebook can then use this data to target ads at you more effectively, for instance by showing more dating-related ads to Tinder users.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77" epub:type="noteref">77</a></p>
<section id="swiping-left-on-facebook-3" class="level3" data-number="12.5.1">
<h3 data-number="12.5.1">Swiping left on Facebook?</h3>
<p>In 2018, Tinder announced that it would let users sign up with their phone number instead of their Facebook account, if they chose.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78" epub:type="noteref">78</a> Why?</p>
<p>In a word, competition. In 2018 Facebook announced a new dating service, widely seen as a competitor to Tinder, and Tinder’s parent company saw its stock price tumble 20% overnight.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79" epub:type="noteref">79</a> Tinder was probably afraid Facebook would cut off its API access and wanted to start building a new way to sign on without being beholden to Facebook.</p>
<p>As this story shows, publishing APIs is a great way for companies to gain data and usage, and using APIs helps apps save development time and offer better features — but it isn’t without risk.</p>

<h2 data-number="12.6">Why does every Washington Post article have two versions of every headline? </h2>
<p>Take a look at the following two screenshots of the same Washington Post piece. Notice anything?</p>
<p><img src="../media/file6.png" style="width:4in;height:0.70086in" alt="A picture containing large, table Description automatically generated" /></p>
<p><img src="../media/file7.png" style="width:4in;height:0.68376in" alt="A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically generated" /></p>
<p><em>Notice a difference? The Washington Post shows people different versions of every headline. Source: The Washington Post</em><a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80" epub:type="noteref">80</a></p>
<p>The headlines are slightly different! In 2016, the Washington Post rolled out a feature that lets article writers specify two different headlines for every article.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81" epub:type="noteref">81</a> But why?</p>
<p>It’s actually an experiment that the newspaper runs to maximize the number of clicks on its articles.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82" epub:type="noteref">82</a> This experiment automatically shows one version of the headline to one group of visitors; let’s say one-half of them, randomly chosen. It shows the other version to the remaining visitors. After letting the experiment run for a while, developers look at particular statistics, or metrics, like the number of clicks on the headline. Developers decide which version is better and show the winning version to everyone. This is a simple but powerful way to improve an app's metrics. For instance, the first version of the above headline was clicked 3.3% of the time, while the bottom version was clicked 3.9%<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83" epub:type="noteref">83</a> — that’s an 18% jump, just by changing a few words!</p>
<p>This technique is called A/B testing. It’s a powerful, data-driven way to improve online products.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84" epub:type="noteref">84</a> It’s named “A/B testing” because you compare at least two versions of a feature, A and B.</p>
<p><img src="../media/file8.jpg" style="width:4in;height:1.93719in" alt="STU Book Graphics_Page_4.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>A/B testing shows at least two variations of the same feature (A and B) and compares relevant metrics to decide which variation to push to all users. In this case, everyone would start seeing variation A, which was better at getting users to take a desired action (or “conversion”).

<p>Not sure which marketing catchphrase will get people to buy? Instead of endless debating, just run an A/B test! Not sure if a red or green “sign up” button will get more people to click? Run a test! (If you’re curious, the red button got 34% more clicks in one experiment.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86" epub:type="noteref">86</a>) Not sure which Tinder profile picture will get you the most swipes? Tinder even lets you run A/B tests to figure out which of your photos, when shown as your main profile picture, gets you the most right swipes.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87" epub:type="noteref">87</a></p>
<section id="all-the-news-thats-fit-to-test-3" class="level3" data-number="12.6.1">
<h3 data-number="12.6.1">All the news that’s fit to test</h3>
<p>That brings us back to the question: why does every Washington Post article have two versions of each headline? It’s part of the Washington Post’s A/B testing framework, called Bandito. Bandito tries out different versions of the headline to see which one people click on more, and then shows the winning headline more often.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88" epub:type="noteref">88</a></p>
<p>A/B testing is very popular among news outlets. BuzzFeed uses A/B tests to find the most clickbaity headlines as well.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89" epub:type="noteref">89</a> A BuzzFeed competitor called Upworthy actually tries up to 25 versions of the same headline in its quest to find the perfect one.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90" epub:type="noteref">90</a> A/B testing is very important: according to Upworthy, the difference between a decent headline and a perfected one is 1,000 vs. 1,000,000 views.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91" epub:type="noteref">91</a></p>
<p>Many more apps and websites use A/B testing. Facebook, for instance, is always rolling out new features to “limited test audiences.”<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92" epub:type="noteref">92</a> Snapchat lets advertisers A/B test their ads to pick the ones that get tapped the most.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93" epub:type="noteref">93</a> Even brick-and-mortar stores can do A/B testing: one startup lets stores vary the background music they play to maximize shoppers’ spending.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94" epub:type="noteref">94</a></p>

<section id="significance-testing-3" class="level3" data-number="12.6.2">
<h3 data-number="12.6.2">Significance testing</h3>
<p>There’s one important caveat to keep in mind whenever you’re doing statistical tests: you need to check whether your observed findings happened because of something meaningful or were just due to chance. For instance, if you flip a coin six times and get five heads, you can’t be confident that the coin is unfairly weighted toward heads — it could just be dumb luck. But if you flipped the coin six hundred times and got five hundred heads, you might be on to something.</p>
<p>When companies perform A/B tests, experimenters report how one version changed a particular metric compared to the other version. They also report a statistic called a <em>p</em>-value, which shows the probability that the difference they observed was due to chance.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95" epub:type="noteref">95</a> Usually, if <em>p</em> &lt; 0.05 (i.e. there’s a less than 5% chance that the difference was just random), they can assume the change was meaningful, or “statistically significant.”<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96" epub:type="noteref">96</a> Otherwise, they can’t be sure that their results weren’t just dumb luck.</p>
<p>For example, say Amazon made the “Add to Cart” buttons a bit bigger for half their users and found a 2% increase in sales, with <em>p</em> = 0.15. While the bigger button seems like a great move, there’s a 15% chance that the sales boost was caused by dumb luck, not the button. That 0.15 is greater than 0.05, so Amazon’s testers won’t roll out the bigger button.</p>
<p>So if you ever get clickbaited by a headline like "18 Food Arguments So Strong That They End Friendships,”<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97" epub:type="noteref">97</a> don’t feel bad — you’re up against a powerful blend of social science, software development, and statistics. Like it or not, A/B testing is extremely effective.</p>
