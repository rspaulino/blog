<p><em>To my friends for their constant inspiration, and my family for being my rock — Neel</em></p>
<p><em>To my family and friends, thanks for supporting my passion for business and helping me push past my fears to embrace entrepreneurship — Adi</em></p>
<p><em>To my friends and family for their never-ending support, and my mentor Deborah Streeter for believing in my vision, which helped make this book possible — Parth</em></p>
<p>When you grow up, you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world, try not to bash into the walls too much, try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money. That’s a very limited life. Life can be much broader, once you discover one simple fact, and that is that everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people will use… That’s maybe the most important thing. It’s to shake off this erroneous notion that life is there and you’re just gonna live in it, versus embrace it, change it, improve it, make your mark upon it… Once you learn that, you’ll never be the same again.</p>
<p>— <strong>Steve Jobs</strong></p>
