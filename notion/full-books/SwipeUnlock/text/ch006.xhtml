App Economics</h1>
<p>In 2010, Apple trademarked the catchphrase “there’s an app for that.”<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" epub:type="noteref">1</a> And, indeed, apps seem to have taken over the world. Multi-billion-dollar companies like Uber (founded 2008<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" epub:type="noteref">2</a>), Airbnb (also 2008<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" epub:type="noteref">3</a>), and Snapchat (2011<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" epub:type="noteref">4</a>) are based on little more than an app. This entire “app economy” is estimated to be worth $100 billion.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" epub:type="noteref">5</a></p>
<p>So how do those little icons on your phone screen lead to billions of dollars in economic activity? The rules for this “app economy” are very different than the rules of the “traditional” economy, where you walk into a store and buy items off the shelf. Let’s explore this strange new world.</p>
<section id="why-is-almost-every-app-free-to-download" class="level2" data-number="5.1">
<h2 data-number="5.1">Why is almost every app free to download?</h2>
<p>A medium pizza might cost you $9.99. A car wash will set you back $15. You’ll need to fork over about $45 a month for a data plan.</p>
<p>But almost every app you have on your phone is free. Instagram, Snapchat, Dropbox, Venmo, Google Maps — all free. In fact, of all the highest-grossing apps on Android and iOS, only one paid app cracks the top 100, and it’s Minecraft.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" epub:type="noteref">6</a> (Meanwhile, the mobile game Fortnite raked in over a billion dollars in 2018 despite being free to play.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" epub:type="noteref">7</a>)</p>
<p>And yet, many companies that produce these free-to-download apps are raking in millions. For instance, the Snapchat app is totally free, yet Snapchat’s parent company (Snap, Inc.) was valued at $33 billion when it went public in 2017.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" epub:type="noteref">8</a> It shows just how different the app economy is from the “normal” economy: if Pizza Hut said they were going to make money while giving away pizzas for free, you’d think they were crazy.</p>
<p>So how do app makers make money without selling software? They’ve come up with some pretty clever business models, also known as “monetization” strategies. Let’s take a look at one of the most popular ones, called “freemium<em>.</em>”</p>
<section id="freemium-more-features-at-a-price" class="level3" data-number="5.1.1">
<h3 data-number="5.1.1">Freemium: more features, at a price</h3>
<p>If you’ve ever played Candy Crush, you’ll notice that the app is free, but once you start playing, you’re bombarded with offers to use real money to buy extra lives or to unlock new levels.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" epub:type="noteref">9</a> Similarly, Tinder lets you “swipe” on potential romantic partners — but only a few dozen a day. If you want to get more “swipes,” you’ll need to pay for Tinder Plus, a monthly subscription.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" epub:type="noteref">10</a></p>
<p>This business model is called “freemium,”<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" epub:type="noteref">11</a> and it’s pretty simple. Give away your app for free, so tons of people will download it, then make them pay for extra “premium” features (hence the name “freemium”).<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" epub:type="noteref">12</a> Freemium is everywhere: it’s how many mobile games like Candy Crush and Pokémon Go make money,<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" epub:type="noteref">13</a> and it’s extremely popular among popular apps like Tinder,<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" epub:type="noteref">14</a> Spotify,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" epub:type="noteref">15</a> and Dropbox.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" epub:type="noteref">16</a></p>
<p>Freemium apps usually use one of two strategies to make money: in-app purchases or paid subscriptions. Let’s dive into both.</p>
</section>
<section id="in-app-purchases" class="level3" data-number="5.1.2">
<h3 data-number="5.1.2">In-app purchases</h3>
<p><img src="../media/file14.png" style="width:4in;height:3.37903in" /></p>
<p><em>Pokémon Go is free to play, but you can use real money to buy coins, which can be swapped for in-game goodies. Source: Pokémon Go on Android</em></p>
<p>In-app purchases usually refer to extra features or virtual items in the app that you can pay real money for.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" epub:type="noteref">17</a> In-app purchases are mobile games’ bread and butter. Candy Crush, as we mentioned, peddles extra lives. Pokémon Go lets you buy coins, which can be redeemed for extra Poké Balls or Potions that’ll let you beef up your pet monsters.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" epub:type="noteref">18</a> Some in-app purchases are just for cosmetic purposes: Fortnite players shell out hundreds of dollars to customize their avatars with things like shirts and dance moves.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" epub:type="noteref">19</a></p>
<p>Paid upgrades are nothing new for games, though. Even decades-old PC games like <em>World of Warcraft</em><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" epub:type="noteref">20</a> or <em>SimCity</em><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" epub:type="noteref">21</a> have long offered paid “expansion packs.” Console games also offer in-app purchases via downloadable content, or DLC, that let you buy access new items, dungeons, and challenges.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" epub:type="noteref">22</a></p>
<p>In-app purchases are primarily used in games, though a few standard apps offer them. Snapchat, for instance, lets you buy your own customized geofilters for special events.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" epub:type="noteref">23</a> And many Android/iOS apps that normally show ads will let you buy an upgrade to remove them.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" epub:type="noteref">24</a></p>
<p>One big reason that game and app creators love in-app purchases are that they’re pure profit: once you’ve built your app or game, it costs basically nothing to give a user virtual items like outfits or geofilters (in other words, the marginal cost is zero).<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" epub:type="noteref">25</a> Poorly or dishonestly designed in-app purchases can lead to backlash, though, like when customers grew outraged after free-to-play Facebook games tricked children into paying hundreds of dollars for in-game items.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" epub:type="noteref">26</a></p>
</section>
<section id="paid-subscriptions" class="level3" data-number="5.1.3">
<h3 data-number="5.1.3">Paid subscriptions</h3>
<p>Besides in-app purchases, the other major “freemium” business model is paid subscriptions, similar to your monthly phone bill. Usually, subscriptions let you unlock useful new features in exchange for a monthly payment. Paid subscriptions are easy to spot; just look for “Plus,” “Premium,” or “Gold.”</p>
<p>Subscriptions are more the territory of non-game apps, and they are everywhere. We mentioned Tinder Plus, which lets you pay a small monthly fee to get unlimited swipes and extra features.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" epub:type="noteref">27</a> LinkedIn requires a monthly payment for LinkedIn Premium, which lets you message people you aren’t connected to.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" epub:type="noteref">28</a> You can stream music for free with Spotify, but to remove ads and store music offline, you’ll have to pay for the Premium subscription.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" epub:type="noteref">29</a> Even Microsoft, which has for years made money selling Office, now offers some Office apps for free but encourages users to buy annual subscriptions to Office 365.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" epub:type="noteref">30</a></p>
<p><img src="../media/file15.png" style="width:4in;height:2.78677in" /></p>
<p><em>Spotify Premium is a classic example of a paid subscription: pay a small monthly fee to get extra features. Source: Spotify</em><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" epub:type="noteref">31</a></p>
<p>Some websites and apps have also started using subscriptions: the New York Times, for instance, lets you read a few articles a month for free but makes you pay monthly to get unlimited access.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" epub:type="noteref">32</a></p>
<p>There are two big reasons app makers are turning to subscriptions. First, they provide a steady and reliable source of income, whereas relying on one-off purchases leads to big spikes in revenue when you release a new update and big crashes at other times. Second, customers who subscribe tend to stick with the app longer (probably because they feel they have a long-term relationship with the app instead of a one-off interaction), meaning they’ll pay the company more money throughout their lives. In business terms, customers will have a higher “lifetime value” (LTV), and maximizing LTV is widely seen as the holy grail for digital businesses.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" epub:type="noteref">33</a></p>
</section>
<section id="whale-hunting" class="level3" data-number="5.1.4">
<h3 data-number="5.1.4">Whale hunting</h3>
<p>As you’ve probably experienced, most people are willing to pay exactly zero dollars for software: one study found that only 6% of all iOS app downloads were for paid apps.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" epub:type="noteref">34</a> Yes, even $1 is too much for most people. But while most people won’t pay anything, the small fraction of people who use a certain app the most are often willing to pay a lot of money. Economists call this the 80-20 rule or the Pareto principle: 20% of your customers will generate 80% of your revenue, and 80% of your customers will generate the other 20%.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" epub:type="noteref">35</a></p>
<p>The key for app developers is to find that 20% of people who want to pay money (called “whales” in the industry, probably because they’re rare but huge) and squeeze as much cash as possible out of them.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" epub:type="noteref">36</a> These whales are big: the average paying user of a mobile game spends $86.50 on in-app purchases every year.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" epub:type="noteref">37</a> Some whales are of positively Moby Dickian proportions: in 2015, the mobile title <em>Game of War: Fire Age</em> earned almost $550 per paying user.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" epub:type="noteref">38</a></p>
<p>Because the heaviest users of an app are the most likely to pay, most in-app purchases or subscriptions are aimed at the most dedicated users. For instance, remember how Tinder lets you pay for unlimited swipes. Most users will never swipe enough to run out of the few dozen free swipes you get per day, but the most enthusiastic Tinderers will quickly run out. And because these users are so committed to Tinder, they won’t mind paying a few dollars to get more use out of it — whereas most casual users would balk at even a small fee.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" epub:type="noteref">39</a></p>
<p>In short, the freemium strategy is this: give away the app for free to draw in a massive number of users,<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" epub:type="noteref">40</a> find the “power users” who love the app, and charge them — either once or via a recurring subscription — for extra features.</p>
<p>But how can a company make money without even charging its users? Read on.</p>

<section id="how-does-facebook-make-billions-without-charging-users-a-penny" class="level2" data-number="5.2">
<h2 data-number="5.2">How does Facebook make billions without charging users a penny?</h2>
<p>Freemium can be highly profitable. But think about Google and Facebook. You’ve probably been using their apps — from Maps and Docs to Instagram and the Facebook app — for years, yet you’ve likely never paid them a single cent.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" epub:type="noteref">41</a> So if they don’t use freemium, how do they make money?</p>
<p>The simple answer: <em>targeted ads</em>. Let’s break down what both of these words mean.</p>
<section id="ad-auctions" class="level3" data-number="5.2.1">
<h3 data-number="5.2.1">Ad auctions</h3>
<p>As you’ve probably seen, apps and websites have long used ads to make money. They’ll charge advertisers a small fee to show their ads on the app or website. But how exactly do apps and websites know how much to charge for ads? There are two main approaches.</p>
<p>First, apps and websites can charge advertisers a small fee every time someone views an ad, a strategy called Pay-Per-Impression, or PPI..<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" epub:type="noteref">42</a> Since so many people view ads, apps and websites usually charge in increments of 1,000 views; that is, the pricing for an ad campaign could be $5 for 1,000 “impressions.” Because advertisers often pay per thousand views, Pay-Per-Impression is more often called Cost-Per-Mille, or CPM.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" epub:type="noteref">43</a> (<em>Mille</em> comes from the prefix <em>milli</em>, as in <em>millimeter</em>.)</p>
<p>Alternatively, apps and websites can charge advertisers whenever someone actually clicks an ad, which is called Cost-Per-Click, or CPC. CPC is less frequently known as PPC, or Pay-Per-Click. <a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" epub:type="noteref">44</a></p>
<p>Google<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" epub:type="noteref">45</a> and Facebook<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46" epub:type="noteref">46</a> offer both Cost-Per-Mille (CPM) and Cost-Per-Click (CPC) advertising to earn money from ads. An advertiser who wants to place an ad on Google or Facebook products, like Google Search or Facebook’s news feed, specifies their “bid,” or how much they’d be willing to pay per click or view. Every time a visitor loads a page, all the advertisers face off in an instant “auction,” and the winner’s ad gets shown.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" epub:type="noteref">47</a></p>
<p>Having a higher bid makes your ad more likely to show up, but the highest bidder doesn’t necessarily win. Google and Facebook consider a few other criteria, like how relevant the ad is, to decide which app to show. Why? More relevant ads will probably get clicked more, so they might make more money than a less relevant ad with a higher bid. Think about it: if you were Google, would you rather show a $5 ad that gets clicked 10 times or a $2 ad that gets clicked 100 times?<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" epub:type="noteref">48</a></p>
<p>Ads are how Google and Facebook make money, but the reason they make <em>so much</em> money is because of a technique called targeting.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49" epub:type="noteref">49</a></p>
</section>
<section id="targeting-ads" class="level3" data-number="5.2.2">
<h3 data-number="5.2.2">Targeting ads</h3>
<p>Would you ever click on an ad for sofas unless you were actively shopping for furniture? Probably not. That’s one of the pitfalls of ads you might see on TV or in a magazine: blasting your message to everyone can be wasteful when only a small audience would be interested.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50" epub:type="noteref">50</a> But what if advertisers strategically showed you sofa ads only when you were moving into a dorm room or new house and needed new furniture? That would probably be more effective.</p>
<p>This “ad targeting” strategy is how Google and Facebook really set themselves apart. Because you do so much on Google’s and Facebook’s apps and websites, these companies know a lot about what you like. They then use this data to target ads to you, which lets them rake in advertising dollars while giving you the service for free.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" epub:type="noteref">51</a></p>
<p>For example, if Google notices that you search for “guide for choosing a watch” or “cost of a cheap watch,” Google could infer that you’re shopping for a wristwatch. Then they could show you ads for watches when you’re doing future searches. Since these hyper-targeted ads are more relevant to you, you’re more likely to click on them than non-targeted ads.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" epub:type="noteref">52</a> More clicks lead to more purchases, so targeted ads help advertisers make more money.</p>
<p>In other words, targeting ads improves the “click-through rate,” or CTR, which gets advertisers more bang for their buck. Since they have more data on users than anyone else, Google and Facebook can target ads extremely well, and so they can charge advertisers top dollar.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" epub:type="noteref">53</a> The business of targeting ads based on user data is lucrative: Google and Facebook rely on ads for almost all of their revenue.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54" epub:type="noteref">54</a> Facebook makes over $30 billion a year from ads<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55" epub:type="noteref">55</a> — which is nearly 99% of its overall revenue.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56" epub:type="noteref">56</a></p>
<p>So, are targeted ads good or evil? Privacy advocates are worried about how these big companies can track your every click<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57" epub:type="noteref">57</a> and know vast amounts about your interests, habits, and activities.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58" epub:type="noteref">58</a> But maybe that’s just the cost of doing business: there’s no such thing as a free lunch, and instead of paying for Google and Facebook products with money, you’re paying with personal data.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59" epub:type="noteref">59</a> This debate is summed up in the Silicon Valley proverb: “if you aren’t paying for the product, you <em>are</em> the product.”<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60" epub:type="noteref">60</a></p>
</section>
<section id="ad-dominion" class="level3" data-number="5.2.3">
<h3 data-number="5.2.3">Ad dominion</h3>
<p>Targeted ads are powerful, and nobody does them better than Google and Facebook. The two companies have a near chokehold on advertising, together accounting for about half of the entire mobile ad market.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61" epub:type="noteref">61</a> It’s much harder for smaller startups to make money off targeted ads because advertisers would rather just buy from Google and Facebook, who have far more user data.</p>
<p>The one company that has been able to scare Google and Facebook’s ad divisions is Amazon, which has become the US’s third-biggest ad platform.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62" epub:type="noteref">62</a> Over half of people, when searching for products to buy online, now start their search on Amazon instead of Google.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63" epub:type="noteref">63</a> With this increased share of eyeballs, Amazon can now place ads directly in a listing of items for sale, which is a place where people are already highly motivated to buy things. And since Amazon knows exactly what you buy, it probably can figure out what you might want to buy with frightening accuracy.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64" epub:type="noteref">64</a></p>
<p>In other words, Amazon has begun competing with Google for ads that lead directly to a purchase, or “direct-response ads.”<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65" epub:type="noteref">65</a> So it is indeed possible for new players to get into targeted ads, though Amazon isn’t exactly a tiny startup anymore.</p>
</section>
<section id="selling-your-data-not-quite." class="level3" data-number="5.2.4">
<h3 data-number="5.2.4">Selling your data? Not quite.</h3>
<p>Finally, it’s important to point out that Google and Facebook — and most other software companies that use ads — don’t sell your data to advertisers. Advertisers submit ads to Google and Facebook, and the two companies use your data to decide what ads to show you. Your data is used extensively on Google and Facebook computers, but it never leaves them.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66" epub:type="noteref">66</a> In fact, it actually helps Google and Facebook to keep user data to themselves, since it forces advertisers to keep coming back to them.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67" epub:type="noteref">67</a></p>
<p>However, Facebook has come under fire in recent years for giving away user data without telling users. It partnered with device makers like Apple and Samsung, handing over user data in exchange for special placement on phones.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68" epub:type="noteref">68</a> Facebook also shared user data with Amazon in exchange for Amazon data that would help power Facebook’s friend suggestion feature.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69" epub:type="noteref">69</a></p>
<p>In short, ad-driven companies — for the most part — aren’t selling your data. As PCWorld put it, it’s more accurate to say that they’re selling <em>you</em>.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70" epub:type="noteref">70</a> And this strategy is so successful that it can build billion-dollar companies that charge users nothing. That’s the remarkable part of the app economy.</p>

<section id="why-do-news-websites-have-so-much-sponsored-content" class="level2" data-number="5.3">
<h2 data-number="5.3">Why do news websites have so much “sponsored content?”</h2>
<p>When you think of ads, you might think of banner ads: those flashy, animated rectangles that show up on webpages or at the bottom of apps. They’re still popular on websites, although fewer and fewer major apps have banner ads nowadays, probably because ads are annoying and take up valuable space.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71" epub:type="noteref">71</a> Plus, people rarely click on banner ads anymore, so they aren’t very profitable. In fact, people only intentionally click on banner ads 0.17% of the time<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72" epub:type="noteref">72</a> — that’s roughly 1 out of every 600 ads you see.</p>
<p>But now, there’s a new kind of ad on the block, and it’s less intrusive and harder to ignore.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73" epub:type="noteref">73</a> When you scroll through your Instagram feed, you might notice some posts that aren’t from your friends but rather from companies trying to sell you something.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74" epub:type="noteref">74</a> Snapchat lets advertisers make filters that millions of users can see,<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75" epub:type="noteref">75</a> and Twitter even lets advertisers buy hashtags that start “trending.”<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76" epub:type="noteref">76</a></p>
<p>The word you see attached to all of these? “Sponsored.”<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77" epub:type="noteref">77</a> Sponsored content, also called “native advertising,” means ads that blend in with normal content, making viewers more likely to take the ads seriously instead of ignoring them.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78" epub:type="noteref">78</a></p>
<p>Sponsored content is growing especially quickly in the world of journalism.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79" epub:type="noteref">79</a> Advertisers can pay to include legitimate-looking articles (which are really just ads) amidst normal material on websites like the New York Times, CNN, NBC, and the Wall Street Journal.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80" epub:type="noteref">80</a> Newer media companies like BuzzFeed also love native advertising.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81" epub:type="noteref">81</a> An increasing amount of “journalism” is becoming dressed-up advertising. For example, the New York Times once ran a story about why the traditional jail system doesn’t work for female inmates. It was a well-researched and engaging story, but it was all an advertisement for the Netflix series <em>Orange is the New Black.</em><a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82" epub:type="noteref">82</a></p>
<p><img src="../media/file16.png" style="width:4in;height:3.89792in" /></p>
<p><em>A piece in the New York Times about women in prisons. It’s a well-written article, but it’s also a native ad for the Netflix show “Orange is the New Black.” Source: The New York Times</em><a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83" epub:type="noteref">83</a></p>
<p>Sponsored content is highly effective for advertisers: native ads are clicked on over twice as much as banner ads.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84" epub:type="noteref">84</a> And it’s become a powerful revenue stream for news publications. For instance, in 2016, the Atlantic expected to earn three-quarters of its digital ad revenue from native ads.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85" epub:type="noteref">85</a> And, since the internet has obliterated journalism’s traditional business model, native advertising might be one of the few things keeping newspapers afloat.</p>
<p>Native advertising is powerful, but it’s dangerous all the same because it makes it harder for people to distinguish facts from marketing.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86" epub:type="noteref">86</a> In fact, Reuters found that 43% of American readers <a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87" epub:type="noteref">87</a>felt “disappointed or deceived” by native advertising.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88" epub:type="noteref">88</a> And, more fundamentally, native advertising breaks down the walls that news publications have traditionally placed between journalists and businesspeople.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89" epub:type="noteref">89</a> In other words, if the same people who report the news are now writing advertisements, journalistic integrity could be compromised.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90" epub:type="noteref">90</a></p>
<p>Is there a silver lining to native advertising? Maybe. One study found that 22% of consumers thought native advertising was educational, versus just 4% who thought the same of banner ads.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91" epub:type="noteref">91</a></p>

<h2 data-number="5.4">How does Airbnb make money?</h2>
<p>Amazon, Uber, and Airbnb are all free to download, never charge you for using the app, and show you few, if any, ads. So how do they make money?</p>
<p>“Marketplace” or “platform” apps like these, which connect buyers to sellers (or riders to drivers, etc.), earn commission by sneaking some fees into the purchases you make.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92" epub:type="noteref">92</a> It’s like how the government makes money using a sales tax or how a real estate agent charges commission whenever they help you buy or sell a house.</p>
<p>For example, Airbnb includes a “services fee” whenever you make a booking. Hosts pay 3%, and guests pay another 6-12%.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93" epub:type="noteref">93</a> These fees provide most of Airbnb’s revenue.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94" epub:type="noteref">94</a></p>

<p><em>Airbnb makes money by charging you a small “service fee” on top of any reservation you make. Source: Airbnb</em><a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95" epub:type="noteref">95</a></p>
<p>Other marketplace apps also take commissions. Uber grabs 20-25% of the money that drivers earn.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96" epub:type="noteref">96</a> Amazon takes a cut when third-party sellers list and sell their items on the platform.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97" epub:type="noteref">97</a> The exact cut varies by product, but one that we can tell you from experience is that Amazon takes between 30% and 65% of book revenues.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98" epub:type="noteref">98</a></p>
<p>So that’s how most marketplace apps make money. Can any marketplace selling apps make money without charging commission? Read on.</p>

<section id="how-does-the-app-robinhood-let-you-trade-stocks-with-zero-commission" class="level2" data-number="5.5">
<h2 data-number="5.5">How does the app Robinhood let you trade stocks with zero commission?</h2>
<p>Buying and selling stocks is a great way to invest your earnings and make extra money, but with every trade you have to pay some commission to a broker. Or do you? The stock-trading app Robinhood lets you make trades for free.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99" epub:type="noteref">99</a> That’s right, zero commission.</p>
<p>So how do they stay in business? There are two main ways Robinhood makes money.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100" epub:type="noteref">100</a></p>
<p>First, they employ the classic freemium model to help “power” users get more functionality. Robinhood Gold lets you trade after hours (i.e. for a few hours before and after the normal trading day, which is 9:30am to 4pm EST), and it lets you borrow money from Robinhood to make additional purchases beyond what you can currently afford.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101" epub:type="noteref">101</a></p>
<p>The second way is pretty clever. Robinhood earns interest from unused money sitting in users’ accounts in much the same way that you earn interest by stashing your unused money in a bank.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102" epub:type="noteref">102</a></p>
<p>As you can see, apps are getting crafty with their business models. Let’s finish the chapter with a look at some even more creative approaches.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-can-apps-make-money-without-showing-ads-or-charging-users" class="level2" data-number="5.6">
<h2 data-number="5.6">How can apps make money without showing ads or charging users?</h2>
<p>Every app we’ve talked about so far makes money by showing ads or charging users (if not up front, then through subscriptions, in-app purchases, or commissions). Is there another way for app businesses to stay afloat? Can apps get money from anyone besides users or advertisers?</p>
<p>As it turns out, the answer is yes. Let’s finish up the chapter by looking at some of these clever business models.</p>
<p>First, you could charge people besides users or advertisers. The travel-booking service Wanderu, for instance, helps you find the best bus tickets and refers you to the websites of bus lines like Greyhound and Megabus to purchase them. Wanderu doesn’t charge shoppers anything, but it takes a small commission from the bus lines for the privilege of sending customers their way.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103" epub:type="noteref">103</a></p>
<p>Or, apps could try to survive without making any revenue at all. It sounds impossible, but in the world of tech, it can happen — temporarily, at least.</p>
<p>Some apps just live on borrowed time (and venture capitalist money), providing free service until they get large enough that they can start earning — in other words, “grow first, monetize later.”<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104" epub:type="noteref">104</a> For instance, Venmo makes no money from your payments to friends. It charges nothing if you transfer money between bank accounts, and if you’re transferring money from your credit card, it only charges you the same fee (3%) that it’s required to pay to the payment processing company.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105" epub:type="noteref">105</a></p>
<p>Then, in 2018, Venmo decided it had a big enough user base to start monetizing. It announced that you could now pay for Ubers with Venmo and rolled out a Venmo-based debit card. In both cases, Venmo charges merchants a small fee. Some have also speculated that Venmo could start targeting ads at users since it now knows exactly what they spend money on.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106" epub:type="noteref">106</a></p>
<p>Other apps just hope to be bought before their money runs out. For instance, a free email app called Mailbox hit the market in 2013, and soon it was delivering 60 million messages a day.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107" epub:type="noteref">107</a> Then, within a month of launch, Dropbox bought the app and the team behind it<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108" epub:type="noteref">108</a> for $100 million.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109" epub:type="noteref">109</a> There’s a slightly tragic ending, though: Dropbox killed the app in 2015 and shuffled the employees to different teams.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110" epub:type="noteref">110</a> Call us cynical, but Mailbox’s ability to grow explosively and get to an attractive “exit” was because it offered its service for free.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111" epub:type="noteref">111</a></p>
<p>In short, app makers have had to become ever craftier now that users demand free-to-download apps. The remarkable part is that app makers never seem to run out of clever ways to monetize. What’s the next big monetization strategy? Now that you’ve read this chapter, maybe you’ll be able to figure it out.</p>
