<h1 class="Chapter-Heading" data-number="16">Conclusion</h1>
<p>You’re never done learning — about tech or about anything else — but you’ve certainly finished the main content of <em>Swipe to Unlock</em>.</p>
<p>We think the case studies and analysis we’ve provided will leave you with a stronger understanding of the <em>what</em> and the <em>why</em> behind technology. We hope you’ll be better prepared to launch the next great app, shape your company’s business strategy, or make sense of the next big tech news story.</p>
<p>Before you go, we have a few last things to cover.</p>

<h2 data-number="16.1">Reference material</h2>
<p>Now that you’ve read the main content, we hope <em>Swipe to Unlock</em> will become a useful reference for you going forward.</p>
<p>To that end, we’ve included a glossary after this chapter. There, we’ve defined dozens of technology and business terms, including some we didn’t get time to cover in the meat of this book, like explanations of popular programming languages, business acronyms, and the types of employees at tech companies.</p>
<p>We’ve also included an index where you can look up companies, products, concepts, and people. If you’re interviewing at a tech company, for instance, you could look up the company and read the key sections about the company’s strategy and products.</p>

<h2 data-number="16.3">Check out our second book, <em>Bubble or Revolution</em>!</h2>
<p>Since we wrote <em>Swipe to Unlock</em>, no technologies have made as big a splash as blockchains and cryptocurrencies. But nobody is quite sure what to make of them: some call them scams, some call them the “biggest invention since the internet.”</p>
<p>Our second book, <em>Bubble or Revolution</em>, breaks down the core concepts of blockchains and cryptocurrencies and offers a balanced, comprehensive, and accessible analysis of their strengths, weaknesses, and future potential. Nir Eyal, the bestselling author of <em>Hooked</em>, called it “a brilliant overview of what could the next big thing in tech, authored by leaders at today's top tech companies.”</p>
<p><strong><em>Bubble or Revolution</em> is now available on Amazon (<a href="https://swipetounlock.com/bubble">swipetounlock.com/bubble</a>) and Barnes &amp; Noble.</strong> Get your copy today!</p>
