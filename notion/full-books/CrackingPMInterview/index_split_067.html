Knowing the “why” will help your answers fit the company’s view of the world. For example, if the company cares about “changing the world,” then you should mix that sort of passion into your answers. Or if the company is passionate about expanding worldwide, you can talk about global expansion and internationalization issues.</p><p class="calibre_1">Knowing the “why” means understanding the following:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Mission:</span> Look up the company’s mission statement. How does it live up to this mission? Be specific.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Strategy:</span> What do you think is the company’s strategy? Are there any missteps with respect to that?</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Strengths:</span> What are the product’s selling points? How does the company leverage those? What about the company or its products has enabled its success?</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Weaknesses:</span> What are the major issues with the company and its products? How should the company address those weaknesses, or should they just accept them?</li><li value="5" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Challenges:</span> What are the biggest challenges for the company right now? How do you see them addressing those? What challenges have they overcome?</li><li value="6" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Opportunities:</span> Is there anything on the horizon (with technology or in their industry) that might create an opportunity for the company?</li><li value="7" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Threats:</span> Similarly, is there anything on the horizon which might threaten the company’s success?</li><li value="8" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Future:</span> What do you think the future holds for this company? Think about any new products or features that would be a natural fit.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">These topics are just to get you started. Your responses to the above questions might well overlap, and that’s okay. If you can make a compelling argument for why the product will (or won’t) succeed and predict arguments to the contrary, you’re probably in good shape.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_67"></div>
