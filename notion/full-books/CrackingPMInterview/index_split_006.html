If you want to get a programming job, you learn how to program. So you go to college for computer science or you learn to write code on your own. Ditto for being an accountant, lawyer, doctor, etc.</p><p class="calibre_1">If you want to be a product manager, what do you do? There are no schools for product management. There’s no formal training. It’s also not a role you typically get promoted into, exactly.</p><p class="calibre_1">How, then, does one land a product manager job? That’s what this book is here to teach you.</p><p class="calibre_1">Jackie and I have worked with countless current and aspiring product managers to help them learn how to get the right experience, how to position themselves appropriately, how to prepare for interviews, and how to ace them.</p><p class="calibre_1">This book translates these many hours of coaching sessions and conversations into written form.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_6"></div>
