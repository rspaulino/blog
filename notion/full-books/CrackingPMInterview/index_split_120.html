My father’s dissatisfaction with the long lines at toll bridges became my first PM-interview-question practice. My husband encouraged me throughout the book writing process. My cats always had a helping paw.</p><p class="calibre_1">I’m immensely grateful to Steven Sinofsky and Marissa Mayer who hired me into their talented PM orgs and have advanced the craft of product management. I’m also very thankful to my wonderful managers: Mike Morton, Tom Stocky, Jack Menzel, Johanna Wright, and Justin Rosenstein who have been amazing mentors and role models.</p><p class="calibre_1">Thank you to all of the people who talked to me about their experiences as PMs and shared their advice. I was blown away by how many of you shared my vision for this book and helped it come into being. I’d especially like to thank Shirin Oskooi for helping me get things started, Daniel Dulitz for suggesting the section on transitioning from designer to PM, Nundu Janakiram for suggesting the section on PM myths, and Chrix Finne for connecting me to lots of helpful people.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="bold">JACKIE</span></p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_120"></div>
