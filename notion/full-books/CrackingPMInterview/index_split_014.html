<p id="filepos65768" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Project Managers and Program Managers</span></span></p><blockquote class="calibre_21">Note: Microsoft has a role called Program Manager that is different from the Program Manager role at most other software companies, and is similar to the Product Manager role described earlier.</blockquote><p class="calibre_22">There are many roles that are related to product management, and the lines between the roles can be blurry. If you’re looking to apply for a project manager or program manager role, see if you can talk to people who have done the role at the companies where you’re applying to make sure you understand the nuances of the requirements.</p><p class="calibre_1">Project managers make sure that their projects get delivered on time and on budget, to the satisfaction of the customer, whoever that may be. Program managers (except for Microsoft program managers) are similar but are usually in charge of a long-running program instead of a series of projects with set end dates.</p><p class="calibre_1">Software companies often have project managers leading teams that are internal-facing, like infrastructure projects and operations programs, or leading consulting teams that are focused on a single customer. This is in contrast to product managers, who usually lead teams building customer-facing products. However, this isn’t a hard and fast rule.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">The Job of a Project Manager</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Two things are unique about these roles. First, the project manager has a very clear and specific customer or goal.</p><p class="calibre_1">Project managers working on infrastructure and operations teams have another employee of the company as their customer. The other employee often has a clear and accurate idea of what they want out of the project.</p><p class="calibre_1">Project managers working with a consulting team serve an individual customer who has already signed a statement of work that includes the details of each project.</p><p class="calibre_1">In all of these cases, the research, planning, and design stages are fairly straightforward, or already done by someone else. For project managers, product design is not usually a big part of their job, so you may or may not get product design questions.</p><p class="calibre_1">Also, because the customer is so deeply invested in the outcome of the project, communication and expectation setting are very important. Project managers need to be comfortable reporting on the team’s progress. Being detail oriented and closely involved with the team are important so that you can answer questions from the customer and explain when things go wrong.</p><p class="calibre_1">The second unique part of project and program management is that budgeting and resource management are a big part of the job. Project managers often work in cost centers, so they focus a lot on operational efficiency and reducing costs while keeping quality up to par, unlike product managers who are often shielded from those aspects.</p><p class="calibre_1">Here are some types of budgeting and resource management work that project managers and program managers do:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre6">Clarify goals and gather satisfaction metrics.</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre_18"><span class="calibre6">Determine the people and skills needed to complete a project.</span></li><li value="3" class="calibre_18"><span class="calibre6">Set up project management tools, plans and processes.</span></li><li value="4" class="calibre_18"><span class="calibre6">Run status meetings and gather status reports.</span></li><li value="5" class="calibre_18"><span class="calibre6">Analyze data to identify opportunities.</span></li><li value="6" class="calibre_18"><span class="calibre6">Identify &amp; implement changes to improve efficiency.</span></li><li value="7" class="calibre_18"><span class="calibre6">Manage changes that come in from the customer.</span></li><li value="8" class="calibre_18"><span class="calibre6">Find ways to keep the project on track even when things go wrong.</span></li></ul><p class="calibre_1">Requirements for project managers vary from company to company and role to role. Some teams look for project management certifications, while others do not. Generally, companies look for project manager candidates who have prior experience managing projects and excellent communication skills.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_14"></div>
