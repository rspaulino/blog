Consultants generally look at a firm broadly, spend weeks or months gathering data, and then tackle big-picture problems such as, “Should our client acquire ________?” They look at things like compatible company cultures, dependence on suppliers, and tax structures. They are expected to be data driven and methodical: ask questions, gather data, diagnose the issue, and propose a solution (which the consultants are rarely there to implement).</p><p class="calibre_1">Product managers focus on the product and its customers. They make decisions about feature sets and market entry, and then follow through on implementing, delivering, and maintaining the product.</p><p class="calibre_1">Even when interview questions overlap (“Should Google launch a TV service?”), appropriate interview behavior differs. Consultants will ask for (and be given) data to solve a problem while PMs will be expected to rely more on their instincts about an issue. For example, a PM interviewer is unlikely to whip out PowerPoint slides upon request. This is not to say that PMs should never be data driven or that consultants shouldn’t use their instincts, but the focus is typically flipped.</p><p class="calibre_1">Consultants: you have been warned.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_101"></div>
