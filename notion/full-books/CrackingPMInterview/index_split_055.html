<p id="filepos292937" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">What to Include</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">Your resume should obviously include your work experience and education. What about all the other little details?</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Objectives: No</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Objectives are almost always a waste of space. Let’s dissect this example of a typical objective:</p><blockquote class="calibre_23">“Experienced technical leader with a bias for action seeking product management role in a fast-paced, growing company.”</blockquote><p class="calibre_1">The “bias for action” part is subjective and a claim anyone can make. The “experienced” description would be clear from the candidate’s resume. The description of the company doesn’t help either. You’re applying to this company; you are, by definition, interested in it, whether it’s fast paced or not.</p><p class="calibre_1">Objectives are just a verbose way of describing the role you’re applying for. There is no need to state what will already be clear from your application.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Summary: Rarely</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">With few exceptions, a summary is rarely useful. If your resume is sufficiently concise, it already <span class="italic">is</span> a summary. There’s no need to re-summarize it in paragraph form.</p><p class="calibre_1">Moreover, most summaries are laden with fluffy, subjective personal descriptions such as “dynamic” and “action-oriented.” These carry little weight in the eyes of the reader.</p><p class="calibre_1">Occasionally, summaries can highlight specific accomplishments or responsibilities that might otherwise not jump out at the reader. However, this case is unusual. A proper design can almost always make your highlights readily apparent.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Skills: As Needed</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">You might want to include a skills section on your resume, particularly if you have programming skills or experience with design software. Skip obvious skills, such as Microsoft Word. Listing this as a skill communicates only that you know how to open a file, edit it, and save it. Everyone knows how to do that.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Awards: Yes—And Make Them Meaningful</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">You should list awards you’ve received. Even ones that don’t seem directly applicable to the skillset are often relevant in showing success, hard work, or creativity.</p><p class="calibre_1">Many candidates list their awards but fail to make their awards meaningful. They list an award like this:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">John R. Robertson Memorial Prize (2013).</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">A resume screener has no idea what to make of this. What is the John R. Robertson award for? How select is it? What did you do to win it?</p><p class="calibre_1">Ideally, your resume should describe what the award is for <span class="italic">and</span> how selective it is. The award above, for example, might be listed as:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">John R. Robertson Memorial Prize (2013): Placed 1st out of 75 students in business plan competition. Entered business plan for low-cost solar heated pools.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">This establishes both relevance and selectivity.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Activities: Sometimes</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Depending on what the activity is and what you’ve done with it, activities and interests may be useful.</p><p class="calibre_1">The more relevant the activity is, the better it is to list it. Technical activities and creative work can be easily seen as applicable.</p><p class="calibre_1">Even if the activity itself isn’t particularly relevant, what you’ve done with it might be. For example, running is probably not applicable to your job application (unless you’re applying to a fitness-related company). However, if you’ve completed a marathon in 17 states with a lifetime goal of covering all 50, then it might be relevant in showing determination—and in just making you “interesting.”</p><p class="calibre_1">Think about activities the way you would other work on your resume. Try to back each up with a concrete accomplishment. If you’re just another person listing “mountaineering” on a resume, it usually won’t mean too much.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Projects: Yes</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Projects are incredibly important. In fact, projects are probably the second most important thing, after work experience.</p><p class="calibre_1">If you have any side projects, list them on your resume. Describe what the project is that you built and what metrics of success you have.</p><p class="calibre_1">For example:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Snakes and Ladders</span> (iOS game): Designed UX for multi-person turn-based iOS game, and hired outsourced development team to implement game. Achieved 10,000 free downloads in first month with 10% conversion to paid version.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">This shows the leadership responsibilities you took on and quantifies your impact.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Website URL: Yes</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">If you have a website or blog, you should include the URL on your resume.</p><p class="calibre_1">If you don’t have a website, consider building one. Your website should provide your resume, as well as additional details about your projects (such as screenshots). It can also list articles you’ve written, press you’ve gotten, lectures you’ve given, and other related interests.</p><p class="calibre_1">Some basic personal information is fine, but keep the website mostly professional. Whether you list it or not, employers will likely look at it.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Social Media Accounts: Maybe</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">If you are active on social media about technology or work-related issues, your social media accounts could prove valuable. Make sure to scrub any old posts that might reflect poorly on you.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">College / University Details: Sometimes</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">The further you are from college graduation, the fewer details should remain on your resume. Exactly when to remove items depends on what the activity was. Use the following as general guidance:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Club Membership and Other “Participatory” Items:</span> Simply being part of a club doesn’t say anything about you. These can be removed upon graduation, if not earlier.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Programming Projects:</span> If you have programming projects, these can stay on your resume for about 2 - 3 years after graduation. If you can replace them earlier with more interesting projects, that’s even better.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Substantial Leadership Positions:</span> If you were the president of a club or had major accomplishments as a leader, you could justify keeping these on your resume for 2 - 5 years after graduation. Simply being “VP of Marketing” for a club doesn’t say much and can be removed fairly quickly.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Founding Accomplishments:</span> Founding a club, charity, sport, or another major activity shows you have initiative and that you get things done. Therefore, you can justify keeping it on your resume for a bit longer—possibly 5 - 10 years, depending on how significant the accomplishment was.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Awards:</span> This varies wildly depending on the awards. An extremely impressive award could conceivably stay on your resume for 10 years (or even longer). Less impressive awards, such as winning third place in a college programming competition, should probably be removed within about two years.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">This guidance is merely a rule of thumb, and it might not be the right advice for you and your resume. How long is appropriate for you depends on what the item shows, how important that skillset is, how else you show that, and what the opportunity cost of including that item is. For example, if your resume paints you to be a stereotypical geek and you’re applying for a product manager job, being a member of a standup comedy group might stay on your resume for five years or more.</p><p class="calibre_1">Generally, your education will go at the top of your resume if you’re in school, but otherwise your work experience comes first. Rather than thinking of this as a hard and fast rule, ask whether you would prefer companies see your company or your school first. If your work experience is much better than your education (or vice versa), it might make sense to break this “rule.”</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">GPA</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">For the first few years out of school, you should list your GPA if it’s above a 3.0 / 4.0. If you are more than about five years out of school, the minimum goes up to around a 3.5. The reason for this is simple: don’t list something from a long time ago unless it really makes you stand out.</p><p class="calibre_1">If you have an exceptional GPA, there’s no last possible timepoint for listing it. You can always tack it onto the bullet listing your major. Most people probably won’t care, but it doesn’t take any extra space. The opportunity cost is zero.</p><p class="calibre_1">If your university computes GPA on something other than a 4.0 system, it may be hard for other people to understand what your GPA means. In this case, try to translate your GPA into something more meaningful. For example, you could translate your GPA by appending a line like (“Equivalent to a 3.3 / 4.0”) or you could list a class rank or percentile.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Online Courses and “Extracurricular” Education</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">If you’ve been taking online courses, you can list these on your resume. Doing so shows a passion for learning as well as some expertise in the subject, both of which are good things.</p><p class="calibre_1">The tricky thing is how to list an online course. If the course is significant enough, you can list it under “Education,” but more likely you’ll put this in an “Additional Information” section.</p><p class="calibre_1">Find ways to make these classes sound more legitimate. If you have a (good) grade, you can list that. Or, if you have completed interesting projects for these courses, that will help as well.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_55"></div>
