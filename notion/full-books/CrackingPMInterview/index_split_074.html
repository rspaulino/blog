<p id="filepos405702" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">“Why should we hire you?”</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">This is an aggressive phrasing for the question, but it can be asked in many ways. An interviewer might instead ask you why you think you would be a good fit for the role or what you think you could offer the company.</p><p class="calibre_1">As intimidating as this question can be, it’s actually a great question for you. You’re being asked to sell yourself; no more subtly inserting little tidbits about why you’d be a great fit. What could be better?</p><p class="calibre_1">Your answer to this question can include any or all of the following:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Why you are a good PM:</span> Have you shown initiative in your current job? Do you have deep technical skills? Have you been successful as a PM in the past? Where possible, back up your answer with evidence. It will be much more convincing.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Why you are a good fit for this space:</span> Have you worked in an area relevant to the team or company? Are you really passionate about the space? Why? This is a good time to mention what you know about the company or team’s industry. For example, if you know a bunch about advertising, talk to the interviewer about how you have experience in this area.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Why you are a good fit for this company’s culture or work environment:</span> Sometimes, there can be unique aspects of the company’s environment that make you a good fit. For example, suppose it’s a very small startup where PMs take on a lot of responsibilities beyond those traditionally belonging to a PM. You might say something like: “I enjoy taking on a diverse set of responsibilities. Outside of work, I started a volunteer organization tutoring children. This has given me the opportunity to juggle responsibilities like marketing, advertising, event planning, management, and recruiting. I’ve found I really enjoy doing a diverse set of tasks at once, and I’m not above taking on the tedious work.”</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">The more you know about the company or position requirements the better. Before your interview, re-read the job description and come up with examples to match what the company is looking for.</p><p class="calibre_1">Many of the elements of your answers to “Tell me about yourself.” and “Why do you want to work here?” apply to this question, but you would use these elements more directly.</p><p class="calibre_1">A good answer to this question might be something like:</p><blockquote class="calibre_23"><span class="italic">I think three things make me a great fit for this position.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">First of all, I have several years of experience as a PM, and I’ve consistently shown success in the role. I’ve launched four critical features from scratch in that time, and was rated the top PM at my company. This is what led to my current hiring manager recruiting me to his team.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">Second, as a CS major and statistics minor, I have the technical and quantitative background that you’re looking for. I haven’t done a ton of data analysis in my current role, but I have the academic background and raw skills to learn it quickly. I’ve actually started learning a bit of data analysis through some online courses. I have no doubt I’ll be able to pick up the skills you need quickly.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">Third, I really want to be here. I’m a fitness junkie, having run three marathons and participated in two Tough Mudder races. I truly believe in your mission of the gamification of exercise and I’m constantly coming up with ways of making exercise more fun. I’ve even recruited several of my anti-exercise friends to regularly workout—and enjoy it.</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_19">This candidate has done several things in this answer that you can learn from. First, he’s shown he wants to be there and he can do the job well. Second, he’s offered information to compensate for what an interviewer might perceive as a gap in his expertise: data analysis. Third, he’s used the opportunity to list specific, concrete accomplishments that wouldn’t otherwise appear on his resume, such as being recruited by a manager. Fourth, he’s tackled the answer with structure.</p><p class="calibre_1">Responding in a well-structured way to a fairly open-ended question will not only demonstrate to your interviewer that you are a strong communicator, but it will also help your interviewer retain the information you give him.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_74"></div>
