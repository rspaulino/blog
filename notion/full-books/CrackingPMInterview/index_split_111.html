<p id="filepos822060" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Developing an Algorithm</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">As we’ve said, many problems are difficult. How then do you come up with an algorithm? Here are a few strategies that work well:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Use an Example:</span> When you get a problem, don’t just sit there in your chair and try to solve it in your head. Get up, go to the whiteboard, and sketch out an example. For example, if you wanted to figure out how to merge two sorted arrays, draw an example of two specific arrays, like {1, 5, 8, 9} and {3, 5, 7, 10, 12}, and walk through how you would merge these. Use specific values (not just variable names like a1 and a2) and avoid special cases (such as the arrays having no elements in common).</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Optimize the Brute Force:</span> There is no shame at all in starting with a brute force solution or a naive solution. It gives you a good starting point from which you can optimize. If the brute force is slow, think about <span class="italic">why</span> it’s slow. Which steps of the algorithm are the biggest time hogs? Focus on optimizing those.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Solve for Base Case:</span> Sometimes, it’s easy to solve a problem for small cases. Try solving it for 0, then 1, then 2, and so on. Can you see a pattern? Or, can you build the answers for these larger cases using the answers for a prior one? For example, if you’re trying to compute all subsets of {a, b, c}, you might be able to use subsets of {a, b} to do it.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Think about Similar Problems:</span> If the problem sounds similar to others you’ve heard before, see if a similar approach will work for this problem. The more practice you do on solving technical questions, the easier it will be to come up with an algorithm.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Simplify and Tweak:</span> Interview problems come with certain constraints, in the size of the input, the type of input, the ranges, or another factor. Try tweaking or simplifying the problem in some way to see if you can solve this alternate version.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Record Your Insights:</span> Some problems have key “insights” that you might discover during your problem solving. For example, maybe you’re looking for a value in a tree and you realize that it has to be on the right side of a left subtree; remember that insight.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">Whatever you do, approach the problem energetically. Don’t be discouraged when you struggle, and don’t give up. Interviewers want to see that you’ll push your way through problems.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_111"></div>
