<p id="filepos94327" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Facebook</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">Facebook is a scrappy, engineering-focused company. There are relatively few product managers; many teams start without a product manager, only bringing one in after the need is obvious. Even when a team has more than one PM, the areas will be big enough that each person is working independently.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Who they recruit</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Facebook has a unique set of PMs.</p><p class="calibre_1">Facebook looks for highly technical and entrepreneurial PMs. At Facebook, all product managers are expected to code (or at least learn the basics) and go through Facebook Bootcamp, a six-week program where PMs and engineers learn the tools and fix bugs. This fits into the do-it-yourself culture; PMs will often code up initial prototypes of their product on their own.</p><p class="calibre_1">When Facebook acquires a company for the purpose of recruiting its employees, it’s referred to as acqui-hiring. When acqui-hiring a team, Facebook looks for small teams, usually fewer than 10 people, composed mostly of engineers. Often, the founder or CEO of the company will be brought on as a product manager.</p><p class="calibre_1">New graduates and people without product management experience join the rotational Product Manager Program. This is a one-year program consisting of 3 four-month rotations on different teams.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">What they do</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">At Facebook, there are some planned company initiatives, but many ideas spring up from watching how people use the site and the problems they hit. PMs will notice an area that needs attention and put together a storyboard and proposal for what they want to build, including the expected outcome. Because PMs have so much freedom, it’s important to know how to position your ideas into the framework of the company and show how they fit into the overall mission.</p><p class="calibre_1">Then, the team will build a prototype to test in a small market and see if the expected outcome happens. If all goes well, things go into motion. The PM will review the proposal with Mark Zuckerberg (whom everyone calls “Zuck”) or the division head to get approval. Then the team brings in designers and turns the feature on internally to start getting feedback from other people at Facebook.</p><p class="calibre_1">During development, the product manager iterates through product reviews. There’s not much project management overhead, but PMs can watch the logs to see new code as soon as the engineers check it in. When everything is ready, the PM coordinates a rollout plan and works with marketing for the launch.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_20"></div>
