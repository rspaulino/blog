<p id="filepos467865" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Types of Behavioral Questions</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">We have listed some of the common behavioral questions below. Note that questions can take many forms and might be a great deal more specific than this. For example, rather than asking you for a challenge you’ve faced, you might be asked for a challenge you faced on a specific project.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Leadership &amp; Influence</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Leading and influencing others is perhaps the most essential responsibility of a PM, so it’s no wonder these questions come up so often. A product manager, unlike a people manager, often needs to influence others without direct responsibility over them, so an interviewer will want to understand what tactics you use to build teams, persuade or influence others,</p><p class="calibre_1">Some common tactics include:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">Gathering data to support your conclusion.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29">Understanding and addressing people’s underlying motivations or incentives.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29">Developing support from key team members first and then leveraging that to get other people on your side.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29">Showing your own vulnerability to encourage others to show theirs.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_29">Being a good role model or example.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_29">Gradually leading people to a conclusion by agreeing on a common framework first.</li><li value="7" class="calibre_29">Developing credibility and engendering trust.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">If none of these jog your memory, think back to times when you’ve influenced other people, whether it was a coworker, a friend, or even a family member. What tactics worked for you? Or what tactics worked on the other side to influence you?</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Sample Questions</span></span></p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ol class="calibre_38"><li value="1" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Describe a decision you made that wasn’t popular. How did you handle implementing it?</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Describe a time when you had to motivate employees or coworkers.</span></li><li value="3" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Tell me about a time when you showed initiative.</span></li><li value="4" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Tell me about a time when you had to give a presentation to people who disagreed with you.</span></li><li value="5" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Tell me about a time when you had to make an unpopular decision.</span></li><li value="6" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Tell me about a time when you had to sell another person or team on your idea</span></li><li value="7" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Tell me about a time when you’ve built a team.</span></li></ol><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Challenges</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Questions about challenges are less about the challenge (although it should be something meaningful) and more about understanding your reaction to challenges. After all, you will be confronted with challenges in your job. They want to understand how you solve problems.</p><p class="calibre_1">To brainstorm challenges or problems you have faced, consider if you’ve encountered any of the following issues at work:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">Ethical dilemmas.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29">Conflicting incentives.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29">Insufficient resources (time, money, expertise).</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29">Incomplete or inaccurate information.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_29">Low morale, interpersonal issues, or other emotional problems (with teammates or the team as a whole).</li><li value="6" class="calibre_29">Cultural or workstyle conflicts.</li><li value="7" class="calibre_29">Changing demands.</li><li value="8" class="calibre_29">Inability to accomplish a task or meet expectations.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">Since there are a wide variety of problems you could have faced, there are a wide variety of ways to solve these problems. Some common tactics include:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">Gathering data to decide what to do.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29">Leveraging the support and expertise of people around you.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29">Discussing and setting team priorities.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29">Understanding the emotions of those around you.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_29">Thinking about what the “right” thing to do is (based on ethics, what’s best for the customer, etc).</li><li value="6" class="calibre_29">Breaking down the situation, focusing on what you know, and understanding more about what you know.</li><li value="7" class="calibre_29">Mitigating risk.</li><li value="8" class="calibre_29">Being honest and straightforward.</li><li value="9" class="calibre_29">Solving the problem creatively or thinking outside the box.</li><li value="10" class="calibre_29">Compromising.</li><li value="11" class="calibre_29">Balancing short-term and long-term tradeoffs.</li><li value="12" class="calibre_29">Managing the expectations of coworkers and customers.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">Some of these challenges could be from an activity outside of work, if you’ve done something substantial there. However, you should be prepared with stories from your formal work experience as well.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Sample Questions</span></span></p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ol class="calibre_38"><li value="1" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Tell me about a time when you faced a challenge and overcame it.</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Tell me about a time when you weren’t able to reach a deadline.</span></li><li value="3" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Describe a major change that occurred in a job that you held. How did you adapt to this change?</span></li><li value="4" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Tell me about a time when you had to deal with changing priorities. How did you handle it?</span></li><li value="5" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Tell me about a time when you had to make a decision quickly or with insufficient data.</span></li><li value="6" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Tell me about a time when you used a lot of data in a short period of time.</span></li><li value="7" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Tell me about a time when you handled a risky situation.</span></li></ol><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Mistakes &amp; Failures</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">At least one of your interviewers is likely to ask about failures or mistakes. The goal of this question, as with other behavioral questions, is to sell yourself. However, what “selling yourself” means here is a bit different than in other questions.</p><p class="calibre_1">Your interviewer will be looking for the following:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">A Big Failure:</span> Your interviewer wants to see that you’ve truly failed before. Right or wrong, many people believe that if you haven’t failed then you haven’t really tried. No one is perfect all the time. Thus, counterintuitively, you need to have a substantial failure under your belt.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Humbleness:</span> Your interviewer is also looking to see that you can <span class="italic">admit</span> failure. They know that you’ve failed at some point in your life. But can you admit it, even in a sensitive moment (such as an interview)? Or will you try to sugarcoat it? You want to come across as genuine and sincere.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Handling:</span> Your interviewer wants to see how you handled the situation. Did you correct the mistake for that incident, or do something to prevent future incidents? How did you relay the information to your manager and/or team? What did you learn from it?</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">One way to come up with good stories for this is to think about the things you’ve learned in your career; often there was a mistake that prompted the learning. For example, maybe you built exactly what the customer asked for, but they didn’t use it. This taught you that you need to dig into the deeper motivations of the customer. Stories like this can be great because they naturally lead into the positive ending: you learned something important that makes you a better PM now.</p><p class="calibre_1">A small number of candidates go too far, and their failure amounts to a “red flag.” If your answer involves doing something grossly wrong and/or truly hurt someone, you might want to pick something else. There’s a “sweet spot” of the size of your mistake. Most candidates are on the “too weak” side, but a small number are on the “whoa! too much!” side.</p><p class="calibre_1">In particular, avoid answers that cut into your honesty or integrity. It’s okay to have made a mistake analyzing data or trying to take on too much. But if you lied or cheated, that’s a much harder thing to recover from.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Sample Questions</span></span></p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ol class="calibre_38"><li value="1" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Tell me about a time when you made a mistake.</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Tell me about a time when you failed.</span></li><li value="3" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Tell me about a time when you improperly analyzed a situation.</span></li><li value="4" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Tell me about a time when you were disappointed with yourself.</span></li><li value="5" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Tell me about a time when you were unable to juggle all your responsibilities.</span></li></ol><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Successes</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Success questions are your time to shine. Your answer to this question might well overlap with your answers to some of the other questions, and that’s okay. Your success might be a big challenge you conquered, a time when you led a team to success, or even a situation where you overcame a potential mistake or failure.</p><p class="calibre_1">For these questions, think about the things that you are most proud of. Why are you proud of this action? Is it because it was hard? Because it had a huge impact on your company? Because it was outside of your comfort zone? Any of these aspects can make a fantastic answer. Pick something that is meaningful to you.</p><p class="calibre_1">Make sure you can explain to the interviewer why you see this as a success. If it’s because it had a big impact on your company, you should be able to quantify the impact. If it was outside your comfort zone, this should have changed you in some small way or helped you discover something about yourself. If it’s about solving a hard problem, you should have learned something.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Sample Questions</span></span></p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ol class="calibre_38"><li value="1" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Tell me about something you’re proud of accomplishing.</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Tell me about a time when you reached a goal that was important.</span></li><li value="3" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Tell me a specific insight you gained from something outside of work.</span></li><li value="4" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Tell me about a time when you went above and beyond the call of duty.</span></li><li value="5" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Describe a time when you resolved a situation before it became serious.</span></li><li value="6" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Tell me about a time when you had to show innovation.</span></li><li value="7" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Tell me about a time when you solved a problem in a creative way.</span></li></ol><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Teamwork</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Teamwork questions are used to assess your interpersonal skills, particularly in times when you are working with your immediate peers. Look for times in your work experience where interpersonal communication or differences in work style affected your team dynamic.</p><p class="calibre_1">How might you have solved these issues? Potential ways include:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">Striking compromises across people.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29">Finding ways of making teammates feel valued.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29">Being able to agree to things that are suboptimal for you in the interest of the greater team good.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29">Understanding people’s underlying motivations and incentives.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_29">Motivating teams and boosting morale.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_29">Relinquishing your ego and encouraging others to do the same.</li><li value="7" class="calibre_29">Setting common goals, metrics, and procedures.</li><li value="8" class="calibre_29">Balancing autonomy with team cohesion.</li><li value="9" class="calibre_29">Building the confidence of those around you.</li><li value="10" class="calibre_29">Increasing individual accountability.</li><li value="11" class="calibre_29">Setting a good example.</li><li value="12" class="calibre_29">Taking personal responsibility.</li><li value="13" class="calibre_29">Showing compassion and empathy for coworkers.</li><li value="14" class="calibre_29">Identifying and dividing responsibilities.</li><li value="15" class="calibre_29">Sharing knowledge and responsibilities.</li><li value="16" class="calibre_29">Mitigating the damage from a negative teammate or situation.</li><li value="17" class="calibre_29">Building trust across the team.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">There is no “right” way to foster positive team dynamics. Part of delivering an excellent answer to this question is understanding that good teamwork depends on the specific situation.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Sample Questions</span></span></p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ol class="calibre_38"><li value="1" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Tell me about a time when you had to work across teams to accomplish something.</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Tell me about a time when you had a disagreement at work.</span></li><li value="3" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Tell me about a time when you mentored or aided a coworker.</span></li><li value="4" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Tell me about a time when you had to do something you didn’t want to do.</span></li><li value="5" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Tell me about a time when you had to compromise.</span></li><li value="6" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Tell me about a time when you had to resolve a conflict.</span></li><li value="7" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Tell me about a time when you had a challenging interaction with a coworker.</span></li></ol><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_85"></div>
