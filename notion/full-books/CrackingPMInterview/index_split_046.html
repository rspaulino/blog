Apple does really value culture fit. This is reflected in their interview.</p><p class="calibre_1">Apple hires for specific teams, not for the company as a whole. Apple’s interview process kicks off with two phone interviews. After that point, you are brought onsite for in-person interviews.</p><p class="calibre_1">Some teams stick with the standard four to five hour (or so) long interviews with members of the team. Other teams, however, may give you as many as twelve 30-minute interviews. These teams apparently value culture fit so much that they want you to meet with a lot of people.</p><p class="calibre_1">Your interviewers will come from a variety of roles: other PMs, designers, engineering managers, an executive (e.g., Junior Vice President of Product Managers). In many cases, a hiring manager will interview you over lunch, but they might also ask someone to fill in for them if they’re busy.</p><p class="calibre_1">Part way through the day, the interviewers might check in with each other to ensure they’re following the right process.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">How Decisions Get Made</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">After your interview, the hiring manager and team will meet together to make a decision.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Special Focuses</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Apple believes passionate employees make good employees, so they want people who are passionate about the company and its products. Expect a lot of questions about why you want to work at Apple. Have a good pitch ready.</p><p class="calibre_1">Similarly, you should know Apple’s products well. Be prepared to describe what you love about them and what you think could be improved.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_46"></div>
