<p id="filepos603981" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Type 1: Designing a Product</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">These questions aren’t nearly as open-ended as they sound. You want to approach these questions like a good PM would: with a structured approach that starts with the user.</p><p class="calibre_1">Remember: it’s not about what <span class="italic">you</span> want the product to be. It’s about what the user wants.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">The Approach</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">We’ve offered one framework that works well for these problems, but there are other frameworks too. Good frameworks have the following in common: they ask appropriate questions, understand and assess a goal (often a good user experience), and apply a structured approach to accomplish that goal.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Step 1: Ask questions to understand the problem</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Before you can even start to answer the question, you need to make sure you understand what the question is. It might not be what you think.</p><p class="calibre_1">For example, suppose you were asked, “Design a pen.” That’s a pretty straightforward question, right? Not necessarily.</p><p class="calibre_1">The pen could be:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">A permanent marker, designed to not come off in the laundry.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29">A pen that uses ink that only shows up under special lighting.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29">A pen for astronauts to use in space.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29">A pen for children to use in the bathtub.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_29">A pen for scuba divers to use.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">Clearly, each of those people would need a very different pen. They would need a different size, color, and feature set.</p><p class="calibre_1">Are they trying to trick you? Yep, in a sense. However, a PM who just dives into creating a product without understanding the goals might create something that is radically different from what the user needs.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Step 2: Provide a structure</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Interviewers are looking for structured thinking. The easiest way to show this is to give a structured answer and call out which part of the structure you’re on. For example, you might say something like, “First I’m going to talk about the goals. Then, I’m going to list out some potential features. Finally, I’m going to evaluate each of those features against the goals. Okay, so starting with the goals...”.</p><p class="calibre_1">This will communicate to your interviewer that you approach problems in a structured way. It will also help keep your thoughts and those of your interviewer straight.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Step 3: Identify the users and customers</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Now that you understand the question itself, you should identify who the users and customers are. Ask more questions if you need to.</p><p class="calibre_1">In some cases, the users and customers aren’t the same person. The customer is the person paying for the product; the user is the one using it. There also may be multiple users.</p><p class="calibre_12"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Example: “Design a calculator for kids”</span></span></p><p class="calibre_31">In this case, the interviewer has told us who the user is. Or have they? There are, of course, many kids in the world and they’re not all the same. The child is also not the only user.</p><p class="calibre_1">We have the following potential users or customers:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">The child:</span> The child is the primary user of the calculator. You will need to know children’s ages. A calculator for seven year olds will look very different from a calculator for high schoolers.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">The teacher:</span> If this is a calculator used in schools or for an academic purpose, then the child’s teacher will likely need to use the calculator or at least understand how it works.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">The parent:</span> The parent may use the calculator when helping a child with homework, and they are likely paying for the calculator as well. This makes the parent both a user and the customer.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">Depending on the type of calculator, there could be even more users. For example, if the calculator is designed specifically for a textbook, then you might also include textbook publishers. Or, if the calculator is being used within a classroom, the school or school district might be the purchaser. This might require special consideration.</p><p class="calibre_12"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Example: “Design a better stove”</span></span></p><p class="calibre_31">As with the “design a pen” example, the stove could be a bit different than we imagine. Is it for household usage? For a large restaurant? For kids? We’ll need to ask questions to figure this out.</p><p class="calibre_1">Let’s suppose there’s nothing funky going on here. We’re just designing a stove for normal home usage. Still, we’ll want to think about the different types of users. This could include:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Novice Cooks:</span> These people are new to cooking and may want something simpler.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Advanced Cooks:</span> These people are more advanced and might want a bunch of advanced settings.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Children:</span> Even if children aren’t using our stove, they’re still around a household. A good household stove can’t pose a safety danger to children.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Elderly or Disabled:</span> Elderly or disabled people might have slightly different requirements since their physical mobility is limited. They might also have special meals or cooking needs.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">Each of these people will have different requirements.</p><p class="calibre_12"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Thinking about Users</span></span></p><p class="calibre_31">With each question, think about where the product is being used and who else might interact with it. As a good rule of thumb:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">Children’s products may be used by children, their parents, and their teachers. The parent or the school might be the customer.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29">Healthcare products (including products for people with disabilities) might be used by patients, doctors, and insurance companies.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29">Sports-related products might be used by athletes and their coaches.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29">Products for a professional (e.g., accounting software) might used by the professional, her assistant, and others in her company.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">We have to design for all of those people, so it’s important to call out who they are.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Step 4: What are the use cases? Why are they using this product? What are their goals?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">For each user (if there’s more than one), make a list of the use cases. This is a list of the different tasks or scenarios that a user might want to use the product for.</p><p class="calibre_1">For example, if we’re designing a keychain for the elderly, the use cases might include:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">Locating the right key in the keychain to open their house, enter their car, etc.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29">Adding a new key to the keychain.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29">Removing a key from the keychain.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29">Finding the keys in the bag.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_29">Finding the keys in their house.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">You’ll need to assess, either by yourself or by discussing the situation with your interviewer, which use cases to design for. You might decide that all of them are very important, or you might decide that some use cases are less important than others.</p><p class="calibre_1">You can also think about these goals at a higher level. You can think about not only <span class="italic">what</span> you do with a product, but <span class="italic">why you do it</span>. What is the underlying motivation? For example, the underlying motivation for the keychain might be independence.</p><p class="calibre_1">You want to convince your interviewer that your product will change the world by appealing to the underlying motivations, goals, and use cases.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Step 5: How well is the current product doing for their use cases? Are there obvious weak spots?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Go through each use case and assess how well the current products or solutions address those. What are the user’s biggest issues with the product? These are the areas you will focus your design on.</p><p class="calibre_1">If there are multiple users (for example, the elderly person and their caretaker), we may need to assess their use cases separately.</p><p class="calibre_1">In many cases, and especially when you get a question in the form of “Design a _______ for the _______,” it can be useful to think carefully about what makes this type of user special. For example, an elderly person often has limited mobility and dexterity, but they are about more than just their limitations; they also have particular values. They might care deeply about family connections, or prioritize healthcare or stability. We’ll need to keep this in mind for our design.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Step 6: What features or changes would improve those weak spots?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Up until now, we’ve just been assessing the current problem and needs. It’s good we spent all that time defining the problem. This will help us come up with a solution that’s truly tailored to their needs, rather than to what you personally would want.</p><p class="calibre_1">In many cases, we will want to solve the issues with multiple use cases at once. For example, the solution to adding a key to the keychain is very closely tied to the solution to remove a key from the keychain.</p><p class="calibre_1">A good way to handle this section is to name a few ideas and then ask the interviewer if they want you to dive deeper into any of them.</p><p class="calibre_1">Make sure to explicitly tie your feature ideas to the use cases or goals. Make it really, really clear you’re coming up with ideas that are customer focused, not just things you’ve always wanted.</p><p class="calibre_1">If you start to run out of ideas, go back to your use cases and be willing to get a little more creative. If the interviewer really seems to expect you to have more ideas, ask if there are any that she thinks you didn’t explore sufficiently.</p><p class="calibre_1">This is a good spot to use the whiteboard as well.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Step 7: Wrap things up</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">As a final step in the interview, it can be useful to give the interviewer an overview of your solution. This is especially important if you’ve been talking for a while. You might have gone over many solutions to the problem, and your interviewer may be unclear as to your current proposal.</p><p class="calibre_1">If you haven’t touched the whiteboard yet, this may be a good time to do so.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Example: Design an Alarm Clock for the Blind</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Let’s walk through this problem step by step. Note that this is only <span class="italic">one</span> solution. There are many ways to respond to this question.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Step 1: Ask questions to understand the problem</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">In this situation, we’re told explicitly who the user is. However, this information may be only half true.</p><p class="calibre_1">What kind of blind person? Many people who are blind can detect light or even see blurry shapes. Second, blind people can be children, adults, or elderly people. They may even have additional disabilities. If we’re designing for a specific type of blind person, this will affect our product.</p><p class="calibre_1">We should also understand where the blind person is using the alarm clock. Will this be an alarm used at home, or perhaps one for travel? Is it even a physical alarm clock, or could the interviewer be asking about a mobile app designed for blind people?</p><p class="calibre_1">Let’s assume our interviewer confirms he’s thinking of a fully blind person—zero ability to see—and that he would like us to design for a blind adult who will be using a physical alarm clock at home.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Step 2: Provide a structure</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">The approach in this problem is essentially the structure we offer to the interviewer.</p><blockquote class="calibre_23"><span class="italic">Okay, now that I understand the problem, I’m going to tackle this in a few parts. First, I’ll think about who the users are and what they’re using the alarm clock for. Second, I’m going to compare existing alarm clocks against these use cases to see where the gaps are. Then finally, I’m going to discuss how we can fill in these gaps.</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_19">As you go through these steps, make it clear to your interviewer when you’re transitioning from one step to the next. You could say something like, “Now that we’ve identified the users, let’s move on to evaluating existing alarm clocks.”</p><blockquote class="calibre_23"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Phrasing Questions</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_6">Be careful about how you phrase your questions. A question like, “What does the blind person do?” can sound like you want your interviewer to solve problems for you. However, if you word it as “Is there anything we know about what a blind person does?” makes it clear you’re trying to work collaboratively with your interviewer.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_23">If your interviewer pushes back with a question such as “What do you think?” that’s a sign to stop pushing with the questions.</blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Step 3: Identify the users and customers</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">We have one user in mind already: a fully blind adult.</p><p class="calibre_1">Who else might use the alarm clock? A blind person is likely around non-blind people, such as their spouse, children, or healthcare workers. Could you imagine if your spouse bought an alarm clock that you couldn’t turn off? Yikes! An alarm clock for the blind still needs to be moderately usable by non-blind people.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Step 4: What are the use cases? Why are they using this product?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">The core use case here is presumably to wake up from sleep, usually in the morning but possibly for naps as well. This means he’ll need to check if the alarm is set, configure the time, enable the alarm, be woken up by it, snooze the alarm, and disable it.</p><p class="calibre_1">Could there be other reasons why the blind person uses the product? Sure!</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">He could be using it to check the current time.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29">He could be using it to time something (e.g., boiling an egg). After all, not all his appliances will be adapted for his disability, so he might use the alarm clock to compensate.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29">He could be using it to remind himself to take medicines. In this case, he’ll probably need some sort of recurring alarm.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29">He may be using it to listen to music or the radio, as many people do with their alarm clocks.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">I’ll assume the primary function we want to design for is the wake-up-from-sleep one.</p><p class="calibre_1">Checking the current time is certainly an important use case for alarm clocks in general, but it may not be an essential one for blind people. People use an alarm clock to check the time because it’s highly convenient (that is, the time is right there, staring at them from across the room). Unless we can achieve similar convenience, blind people probably wouldn’t use the alarm clock for this purpose. They would default to using whatever they otherwise use to check the time.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Step 5: How well is the current product doing for their use cases? Are there obvious weak spots?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">A standard alarm clock relies on visual indicators for almost everything. We know if the alarm is on or off based on a light on the alarm clock. We know the current time because we can read it on the display. We just look at the alarm clock to know if the device is plugged in. Essentially, the only thing we don’t use a visual indicator for is waking up.</p><p class="calibre_1">This poses a number of challenges for a blind person, since he won’t be able to see the visual indicator.</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Enabling / disabling the alarm:</span> Alarms commonly have a single button to toggle the alarm; press the “alarm set” button to flip the state. This is fine when you can see if the alarm is set, but it’s likely to be problematic for a blind person. Toggling the state of something only works well if the current state is very obvious.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Ensuring the alarm is plugged in:</span> Electronics can get unplugged for any number of reasons. Simply giving the blind person a way to check if the alarm is plugged in might not be enough, since they probably won’t remember to check this option before going to bed. Rather, we need to make it <span class="italic">obvious</span> that the alarm is unplugged.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Checking if the alarm is set:</span> A standard alarm clock has a light on the display to indicate whether the alarm is enabled. This won’t work for blind people since they can’t see the indicator light.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Setting the alarm:</span> A standard alarm clock is set by pushing an “up” or “down” button on the time, and waiting until the time is set correctly. Since a blind person can’t read the clock, the visual feedback on the time doesn’t really help them.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Setting / checking the current time:</span> Although we don’t need to use the alarm clock to check the time, we do need to ensure the current time is set correctly. Since a standard alarm clock relies on a visual display for the time, this doesn’t work well for blind people.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">We now need to resolve these issues.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Step 6: What features would improve those weak spots?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">We want to keep the alarm clock simple to use. Complicated designs are no fun for anyone, blind or not.</p><p class="calibre_12"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Design 1: Audio Playback</span></span></p><p class="calibre_31">The major issue we’ll need to design around is the lack of visual display. As a very simple approach, we can use audio playback, in addition to a visual display.</p><p class="calibre_1">The benefit here is it’s easy to build audio playback, and the use of a visual display would make the design usable for non-blind people as well.</p><p class="calibre_1">However, it has a major drawback: it might wake up the blind person’s partner or spouse. We’ll work with this approach for now, though.</p><p class="calibre_12"><span class="italic">Turning on / off alarm + Ensuring the alarm is plugged in</span></p><p class="calibre_31">Like a standard alarm clock, this alarm clock could have a button that turns the alarm on and off. We will provide audio feedback when we set the alarm to indicate either “the alarm is on” or “the alarm is off.” This also makes it easy to ensure the alarm didn’t get secretly unplugged.</p><p class="calibre_12"><span class="italic">Checking if the alarm is set</span></p><p class="calibre_31">To keep things simple, we can just reuse the button that turns the alarm on and off. We don’t really need a special button for this.</p><p class="calibre_12"><span class="italic">Snoozing the alarm</span></p><p class="calibre_31">To snooze, we will have a separate “snooze” button, much like a normal alarm.</p><p class="calibre_12"><span class="italic">Setting the alarm time</span></p><p class="calibre_31">To set the current alarm, we can offer “up” and “down” buttons to change the hour and minute hands. When we press a button, it announces the current time.</p><p class="calibre_1">Doing this on every single button press might be a bit slow though, particularly when changing the minute. Instead, we can design it so that if you hold down the “up” or “down” buttons, it suppresses the audio playback until the button is released.</p><p class="calibre_12"><span class="italic">Setting the current time</span></p><p class="calibre_31">We can set the current time essentially the same way that we would set the alarm time.</p><p class="calibre_12"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Design 2: Limited Audio Feedback</span></span></p><p class="calibre_31">As we said earlier, the issue with using audio playback is that it might disturb others in the room. We may want to design a more advanced alarm clock that doesn’t rely on audio playback for the most common functions (particularly those that might be done while the user’s partner is asleep): turning on and off the alarm and setting the alarm time.</p><p class="calibre_12"><span class="italic">Turning on and off the alarm</span></p><p class="calibre_31">Instead of audio feedback, we could use a physical switch (much like a light switch) to turn the alarm clock on and off. The risk here is that the alarm clock could wind up unplugged and the user wouldn’t know.</p><p class="calibre_1">Instead, we can still use a single button to toggle the alarm. Instead of audio feedback, the clock will vibrate once to say “alarm is on” and twice to say “alarm is off.”</p><p class="calibre_12"><span class="italic">Checking if the alarm is set</span></p><p class="calibre_31">Again, we will just reuse the button which turns the alarm on and off. The vibration feedback will tell us if the alarm is set.</p><p class="calibre_12"><span class="italic">Setting the alarm time</span></p><p class="calibre_31">To set the alarm time, we can have several rows of buttons on the side of the alarm clock. Each button would have the number written in braille as well as in colored text for a non-blind person. Since we’re using buttons to set the time, we don’t need to use audio playback.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><table valign="top" class="calibre7"><tr valign="top" class="calibre8"><td valign="top" class="calibre_40"><p class="calibre_"><span class="bold">Hour</span></p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre_40"><p class="calibre_"><span class="bold">12</span></p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre_40"><p class="calibre_"><span class="bold"> 1 </span></p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre_40"><p class="calibre_"><span class="bold"> 2 </span></p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre_40"><p class="calibre_"><span class="bold"> 3 </span></p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre_40"><p class="calibre_"><span class="bold"> 4 </span></p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre_40"><p class="calibre_"><span class="bold"> 5 </span></p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre_40"><p class="calibre_"><span class="bold"> 6 </span></p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre_40"><p class="calibre_"><span class="bold"> 7 </span></p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre_40"><p class="calibre_"><span class="bold"> 8 </span></p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre_40"><p class="calibre_"><span class="bold"> 9 </span></p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre_40"><p class="calibre_"><span class="bold">10</span></p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre_40"><p class="calibre_"><span class="bold">11</span></p></td></tr><tr valign="top" class="calibre8"><td rowspan="2" valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_"><span class="bold">Minute</span></p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_">0</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_">1</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_">2</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_">3</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_">4</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_">5</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_">6</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_">7</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_">8</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_">9</p></td><td colspan="2" rowspan="2" valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_">AM</p><p class="calibre_">/ PM</p></td></tr><tr valign="top" class="calibre8"><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_">0</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_">1</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_">2</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_">3</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_">4</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_">5</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_">6</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_">7</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_">8</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_">9</p></td></tr></table><p class="calibre_1">The AM / PM button would be pushed in to indicate it’s set to AM, otherwise it would be set to PM.</p><p class="calibre_1">This might be far more buttons than we really need. Does anyone really need their alarm clock to be capable of setting their alarm for exactly 9:23 a.m.? Probably not. Setting the alarm to 9:25 or 9:20 would work just fine.</p><p class="calibre_1">Let’s remove some of these buttons to clean up our design. Simplicity is a good thing in design.</p><p class="calibre_2"><img src="images/00007.jpg" class="calibre_46"/><br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="calibre_1">We could potentially simplify this even more, by just listing :00, :15, :30, and :45.</p><p class="calibre_1">Alternatively, we could replace the minute buttons with a circular dial. However, a dial for the hours could be a bad idea, since someone might accidentally set the switch to the wrong hour.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Step 7: Wrap it up</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Depending on the priority we place on not disturbing the user’s partner, we may or may not use audio feedback. You could mention to your interviewer the sales benefit of marketing the alarm clock as non-intrusive to bed partners.</p><p class="calibre_1">The first design uses audio feedback to basically replicate what the physical display does. We still have a visual display, in case non-blind people use the device, but we announce any alarm or other changes out loud. The only non-obvious change here is suppressing the time-change announcement when we hold down the “up” or “down” arrows.</p><p class="calibre_1">If we’re concerned about waking up the user’s partner, we can remove the audio feedback and replace it with vibration (to indicate the alarm status) and physical buttons (to set the time).</p><p class="calibre_1">In either case, we will keep the physical display to ensure the device is usable by non-blind people as well.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_94"></div>
