<p id="filepos376632" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">The Product</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">You should understand what the company is doing at a deep level. A cursory “it makes home automation tools” level of understanding is not sufficient. Knowing the following information will help you stand out:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Products:</span> What is the array of products or features that the company creates? How do the products fit with each other?</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Competitors:</span> Who are the competitors? How does the company differentiate itself from them?</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Customers/Market:</span> What is the target market for the company? Are there any secondary markets right now or that you would suggest the company enter?</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Revenue:</span> How does the company make money? How would you suggest the company make more money? If it doesn’t make money, what revenue strategies would you want to explore?</li><li value="5" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Love and Hate:</span> How do customers feel about the product? What do they love or hate? What are the most common complaints and issues?</li><li value="6" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Metrics:</span> If possible, try to learn about the company’s key metrics. Finding exact numbers might be difficult, but you can at least get an understanding of which metrics they’re doing well on and which ones they’re struggling with. How many users does it have? What is its conversion rate? What is its growth rate?</li><li value="7" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">News and Rumors:</span> Have there been any interesting news reports about the company? What is the company rumored to do? Don’t just read this stuff. Formulate an opinion on it.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">To learn this information, check out the company website, their About Us pages, their blog, their job sites, their SEC filings, newspaper articles, blog articles, their support pages, and whatever pops up in online searches.</p><p class="calibre_1">You should also <span class="italic">use</span> the product yourself, and you should use it extensively across multiple user types. If it’s a product with free and paying users, try to use it in both scenarios (if possible). Think about what parts you enjoyed and what you didn’t. Pay particularly close attention to anything that would have turned you away if you weren’t “forced” to check it out.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_66"></div>
