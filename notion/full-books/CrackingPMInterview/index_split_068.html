<p id="filepos381996" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">The Culture</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">Some candidates get so focused on the product that they forget it’s the people who make the company (which in turn makes the product). Or they do some quick “online stalking” of their interviewers but don’t think about the aspects that really matter.</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Culture:</span> What is the company’s culture? The company’s job pages might discuss this a little, but that’s obviously going to be biased toward the image they want to project. Look online for reports of what candidates, current employees, and former employees say about working there.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Values:</span> What does the company value? By “values,” we mean anything that’s important to them, explicitly or implicitly. To understand this, read interviews with the founders and think about their culture and products. Values might include aspects such as moving fast (Facebook) or “don’t be evil” (Google).</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">History:</span> How long has the company been around? How did the company get started? Have they been doing what they set out to do, or have they pivoted?</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Interviewers:</span> If you know who will be interviewing you, you can search for more information about them online. Don’t be creepy, though. Congratulating an interviewer on her recent marriage comes off “stalker-ish”; it’s best just not to mention things like that.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Key People:</span> Who founded the company? What were they doing previously? If it’s a startup, who funded the company? Are there well-known people at the company? These aren’t just “facts” to know; you should think about them. How does the background of the founders and other key people affect the company?</li><li value="6" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Organization:</span> How big is the company? How is the company organized? Does everyone basically report to the CEO or is there a strict hierarchy?</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">The point of this knowledge is not to whip it out to impress the interviewer (it probably won’t), but to use this information to get a feel for what the company is really like. You want to make sure a company is a good fit for you, too. Sometimes candidates are so focused on landing the job that they forget to make sure the job is really right for them.</p><p class="calibre_1">This information has another benefit, too: it can help shape your responses to behavioral questions, like how you influence teammates or how you would implement a decision.</p><p class="calibre_1">If you can, try to fit all the little learnings together. That is, match the culture to the strategy and other parts of the company. For example, Amazon has a reputation for being very money and metric driven, as well as very frugal. Is this because Amazon is a relatively low-margin business? Is it because Amazon was not profitable for a long time? How does this affect its strategy?</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_68"></div>
