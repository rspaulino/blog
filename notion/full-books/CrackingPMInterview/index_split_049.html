<p id="filepos269374" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Twitter</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">Twitter’s process starts with a hiring manager who does a general phone screen and then matches you with a specific team. You will do one or two phone screens before being brought onsite.</p><p class="calibre_1">In the onsite interview, you may go through as many as seven interviews that are 45 minutes each. Your interviewers will be a mix of peers (fellow PMs) as well as people whom you might work with, such as engineering managers, tech leads, or people from the support team.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">How Decisions Get Made</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Each hiring manager does things a bit differently. However, Twitter generally only extends an offer when someone is a “slam dunk.” They want someone who brings something new to the team.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Special Focuses</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Twitter really wants people who have done their homework and love Twitter. Applying to Twitter just for its brand name (as oh-so-many people do) won’t cut it. Instead, you should play with their technology and really understand it. You need to “get” Twitter, not just be a casual user. What do you think is really cool? How does it work? What would you do if there were an issue? You should be obsessed with creating a great experience for the user.</p><p class="calibre_1">Twitter also wants people who can handle change, since Twitter is growing rapidly. You should be willing to wear many hats, be good in stressful situations, and have excellent interpersonal skills. Behavioral questions are very important.</p><p class="calibre_1">Twitter PMs will generally not be asked coding questions, but they may be asked how to technically design a product. You should understand concepts like preloading and calculating on the fly.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_49"></div>
