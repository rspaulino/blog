<p id="filepos209548" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Q &amp; A: Brandon Bray, Principal Group Program Manager, Microsoft</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Tell me a little bit about your career.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">I’ve always been in program management. I started in Microsoft Office as an intern on Outlook over two summers. After college, I came to Microsoft on Visual Studio on the team where C# began, which also happens to be the team where C++ was.</p><p class="calibre_1">I started on the C++ backend, so it was very technical. Some people think of program management as just frontend, but I worked with AMD and Intel, all of the silicon vendors. It was really fun.</p><p class="calibre_1">After doing that for a while, I switched to the other side of the C++ compiler. I designed the language for the C++ CLI [common language infrastructure]. I got to travel all over the world and work with ECMA and ISO and all the companies that are moving the language forward.</p><p class="calibre_1">Then I decided to broaden my experience. I took on a project management role and became a lead at the same time. I took the project management role to deliver Visual Studio 2008. This was still a program management role, but specifically around release management. Program managers usually do just a little bit of project management and spend a lot of time on design. Release managers pay attention to exit criteria, and all of the other pieces of project management to make the entire release go well.</p><p class="calibre_1">After that, I went to China for a year and built up a PM team in Shanghai. That was when I realized that most people learn to be PMs from watching other PMs. In Shanghai, there weren’t many other PMs around. So I had to find another way to help these PMs learn.</p><p class="calibre_1">Next, I came back to the US and became a group program manager on the .NET Framework. Group program manager is the second-level manager. I helped ship Windows 8 and then moved to the C# and Visual Basic team. The team had a new compiler, but it didn’t look like it was going to be ready on time, so I helped get it over the shipping hump.</p><p class="calibre_1">And most recently I switched to a new, unreleased hardware project. I decided to switch back to an individual contributor role for a change, and I’ll be working to make sure we have a great development platform.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">What were some of the key breakthrough moments in your career?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">One that definitely was a highlight of my career was writing the language specification that eventually became a standard for C++ and the CLI. I had to work with people from different companies.</p><p class="calibre_1">This was where I learned that whoever writes things down has the power. People in different disciplines such as test and dev think that PMs make all the decisions. Then when they switch over and they wonder how they got to make decisions, and it’s because whoever writes things down records history. The ways you write things down and what you write down define history. The power of the pen.</p><p class="calibre_1">I got to have more influence on the way things should work out. Also, writing is thinking. If you go through the details of writing things down, you end up thinking about the corner cases.</p><p class="calibre_1">Another moment that I talk about is around the impact you can have really early in your career. One of the first things I did on the C++ compiler was the /GS feature [buffer security check]. This feature was built in response to the buffer overrun attacks. The team had built something to counteract buffer overruns, but it missed a lot of cases. I looked to see what was needed to make it really useful.</p><p class="calibre_1">Then, I talked to all of the teams at Microsoft and convinced them to use the new compiler and rebuild their code with this switch. It was a lot of work, but it made a big difference in the security of our products.</p><p class="calibre_1">The last key breakthrough has been as a manager in the past few years. Shaping how PMs think and shaping the culture of a PM team have been fun for me. Working on some of the really technical teams it’s really easy to forget that there are different styles of customers out there. There are developers, end users, IT staff, and so forth. We had to really focus and remember that electrons are not our customers; people are our customers. I’ve helped my team remember to think about how people experience what we do.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Were there any things you did that helped you get promoted?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">My time as an intern helped me go from PM 1 to PM 2 quickly. I’d learned how to be a program manager from my internships. I was promoted into the senior band around the same time as I became a lead and a project manager. I’d written down that I wanted to be a lead at some point, and the team came to me and asked me to be a lead since they needed someone to do the work.</p><p class="calibre_1">For being promoted into the principal rank, I took on a division-wide procedure - what we called Fundamentals and Tenets. It was a system to go through all the pieces for a successful product: security, performance, reliability, world readiness, privacy, compliance, things like that. So it was a process to make sure all those things happened, but it wasn’t going well at all. They gave it to me to run.</p><p class="calibre_1">I worked at the divisional level with all of the product teams. I had to engage with 300 people to get things moving along, and I got it to the place where I turned the problem around. It was fighting a fire. Since that project had a really large scope, that took me to the principal level.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">What advice would you give to someone interviewing to become a PM?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">The thing I tell everyone is that a PM is an expert in their customer. That’s what sets them apart from the developers and testers. A PM on Excel has to be the expert in the kind of things people do on Excel. Those people might be quants or other kinds of number crunchers. Developers on Excel don’t need to understand quants, but the PM does.</p><p class="calibre_1">In my space, those customers are developers. And that brings me to another point: you have to really like your customers. If developers are your customers, you need to be able to get into their mindset and be the customer yourself. If you’re a PM for a game, you should really sympathize with and understand gamers. Same thing if your customers are database admins.</p><p class="calibre_1">When I’m interviewing, the thing I check for, no matter what, is passion. Do you care enough about your work that you’re spending your free time learning about it?</p><p class="calibre_1">As advice for someone new, make sure you find a job where you’re interested in doing something outside of work. Whether it’s going home and working on a project or a going to a meetup or going to conferences. Something that extends what you have to do on a day-to-day basis. If you have that passion and a drive for learning, you’re set up to be an awesome PM.</p><p class="calibre_1">Sometimes people ask me if you can work on a team when you don’t already know the area. If you’re interested in the area and have a drive for learning, you can be successful in any group. People learn really well when they have an objective in front of them. Great PMs have an enormous impact on their team’s efficiency, so the people on the team are incentivised to help the PM learn.</p><p class="calibre_1">As another interviewing tip, when I’m interviewing and I want to tell if the person should be a dev or a PM, I’ll usually ask questions that can go in two different directions. You can either start designing the solution and building algorithms, or you can step back and talk about who the customers are, what the goals are, and start defining success.</p><p class="calibre_1">Good PMs can start down the implementation path, but pretty quickly they realize they need to step back and talk about the customer. If they don’t, it’s pretty obvious they don’t have the inherent starting ability to be a PM. It has to be a trained skill.</p><p class="calibre_1">If you’re interviewing to be a PM, it’s good to look at every problem starting with “Who is the customer?” and “What is success?” I do that all the time. I’ll be at a stoplight in a traffic intersection and will think “How can I make this better? Who am I making this better for?” These problems show up all the time, so you can train yourself to think this way.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_38"></div>
