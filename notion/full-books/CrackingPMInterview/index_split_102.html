<p id="filepos665497" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">What Interviewers Look For</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">One PM candidate I prepped explained that, in a recent interview with a top startup, he was asked what he would do if he were CEO of the company. “How can she even ask me that?” Michael complained. “I told her it was an unfair question since I obviously don’t have as much knowledge as she does about the company.” Suffice to say, that didn’t go over so well.</p><p class="calibre_1">For all the Michaels out there: Of course you don’t have the knowledge to truly solve the problem. Of course you could solve it better if you did. But that’s not the point; in fact, it’s not even an issue.</p><p class="calibre_1">An interviewer is not evaluating you on the correctness of your eventual conclusions but rather on the process you take to get there. For <span class="italic">that</span> goal, you don’t need all the data and background information that you would have in the real world.</p><p class="calibre_1">Interviewers are looking for candidates who will do the following:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Structure a problem:</span> Even seemingly open-ended questions can, and should be, broken down into components. Your market can be segmented and your strategy can be divided. Find a way to tackle a problem in a structured way.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Show strong instincts:</span> We rarely have all the data we’d like, and we don’t know what the future will hold. A good PM should be able to make good business decisions, even in the absence of exhaustive data.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Drive, Not Ride:</span> You might not be the CEO of the product, but you are a leader. Show this by driving the interview forward. Be relatively exhaustive in your response to a question – discuss the benefits and tradeoffs, the short-term and long-term benefits, etc. – and back up your answers with reasons. Don’t go overboard, though. If you find your interviewer is asking many follow-up questions and you’re only giving short responses each time, you might be riding and not driving. On the other hand, if you’re concerned you’re going into too much detail, ask your interviewer if he’d like you to expand.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">You can and should ask questions, but there’s a limit. If your interviewer flips a question back to you (e.g., “Well, what do you think?”), that’s a tipoff that you went too far with your questions. No big deal. Just get back in the driver’s seat: think about the problem, make the best decision you can, and explain your reasoning.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_102"></div>
