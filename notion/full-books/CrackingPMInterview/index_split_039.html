<p id="filepos219040" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Q &amp; A: Thomas Arend, International Product Lead, Airbnb</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Tell me a little about your career path.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">I studied math and computer science in Berlin. My first job was with IBM. Originally I was an engineer. At the time, there weren’t any product managers.</p><p class="calibre_1">I found that what I liked most in my job was to go out and explain the product in non-technical terms to our customers, and then come back and explain who our customers are to the rest of the team. I’d talk to users and potential users and try to find out what they wanted. Usually the first stage was just listening to them complain.</p><p class="calibre_1">It took me a long time to figure out what product management was. I was happy with what I did, but from my manager’s point of view, I was an under-performing engineer. At my performance reviews, he’d say, “In terms of engineering you aren’t one of the top performers. But whatever you’re doing, keep doing it.” So I kept doing it, and it was a big relief for me when I heard about the product manager role, since I realized that was what I was!</p><p class="calibre_1">I was a PM for SAP for several years, and then switched to the business side of things for a bit. I worked with the CEO on company strategy for a few years. That was a great learning experience, but I missed building products.</p><p class="calibre_1">So I went back to product and design. After 11 years, I had learned so much and the company had grown so much that my interests shifted toward the web and to much smaller companies.</p><p class="calibre_1">I left for Google and worked there for five years. I worked on internationalization and gave them the 40 languages initiative, and then worked on iGoogle on Marissa Mayer’s team. When I left, I left on a high note.</p><p class="calibre_1">I joined Mozilla for a year. I was fascinated by Mozilla and nonprofits. It turns out I loved the idea but not the execution, so then I moved on to Twitter, where I stayed for one and a half years and worked on several products.</p><p class="calibre_1">I’ve been at Airbnb for 7 months. I’m the head of International. My goal is to make us successful in 192 countries. The role includes not only localization and translation, but also includes the strategy in different countries. I get to not just build one product, but to work with the other PMs to build the best product in all countries.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">What were some of the key breakthrough moments in your career?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">There were many moments that helped me become what I am today. One of the big things was talking to a lot of awesome role model product managers. When I joined Google, I talked to Sundar Pichai and a lot of people who had been there for a while and whom I really respected for being awesome product managers. Not to copy their style, but to learn what worked and didn’t work. I learned so much from them.</p><p class="calibre_1">Now I’m on the other side of those requests, and I meet with everyone who contacts me. I strongly recommend to everyone who wants to become a PM that they build a network. You learn to write by reading. Look at good products, see how they build products users love, then contact the people who work there and ask them how they did it.</p><p class="calibre_1">Another big moment was when I worked on design services, such as an internal IDEO at SAP. The team was awesome. I participated and ran workshops with IDEO. It just blew my mind; in only one day of a workshop, I learned empathy with your user and rapid prototyping. They open your eyes for unmet user desires and teach you how to observe without jumping to conclusions.</p><p class="calibre_1">You get thrown into a new problem like redesign a bookstore. With little guidance, you go out and talk to users, take pictures, come back and synthesize, prototype, and bring your prototype back to user to see how it works.</p><p class="calibre_1">Young PMs can do that on their own. If you live in Mountain View, take a potential task, such as how to make the Caltrain ticket machine a delightful experience, and go through those steps. Observe, take pictures, talk to people using the machine, and find out who they are.</p><p class="calibre_1">Figure out your personas - maybe they’re commuters or tourists. Then synthesize the problems. Maybe there’s glare on the display. You synthesize, prioritize, simplify down to themes, and then build prototypes. You can even make paper or cardboard prototypes. Then go back to those users and ask people if they want to try your prototype. You can do this alone. It’s better with other people, but you can do it yourself. One guy I know started a blog and did this with lots of things; it was addictive for him.</p><p class="calibre_1">Now I’m on advisory boards for startups. I try to teach them to understand who their users are and why would those users would care about the product. I see so many pretty solutions in search of a problem. I talked to a company who wanted product advice. I asked them who their users were, and they said wedding planners, bakers, personal trainers, the flower shop around the corner. So then I asked how many of those customers they’d actually talked to and they said zero. So I told them the first thing they needed to do was go out and talk to their users and find out who their users are.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">What advice would you give to a PM who wants to advance in their career?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Know what you’re passionate for and passionate about.</p><p class="calibre_1">There are some pretty good tools you can use to learn who your users are and create hypotheses about their desires and come up with ideas about what the solutions might be. There’s a methodology of storyboarding and personas coming from user research that you can learn.</p><p class="calibre_1">It helps to have a CS degree or be technical. You need to work with engineers and earn their trust. If they have to dumb it down for you, you’re lost.</p><p class="calibre_1">If I develop a new line of cars, I don’t have to be an engineer to build the car, but it would help if in my spare time I can at least change a tire and know what’s going on under the hood, and ideally I can name all the parts and get my hands dirty to change some of them.</p><p class="calibre_1">It’s important to know what’s under the hood and have an interest in it. If someone doesn’t have any interest in the technical side, then maybe the technology field isn’t for them. How would you feel about teaching yourself some Java by buying a book, installing eclipse, and building a simple mobile app? If that would excite you, that’s great. If you think, “Do I really have to?” you’re probably in the wrong industry.</p><p class="calibre_1">It’s good to know as much as possible about design and user research. A good PM doesn’t only create delightful experiences but knows how to measure success and define success. User-focused, metrics-supported decisions are always the best.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_39"></div>
