<p id="filepos203393" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Q &amp; A: Ashley Carroll, Senior Director of Product Management, DocuSign</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Tell me a little about your career path.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">I started at JPMorgan out of undergrad, because that’s what you did at that time with an econ degree. I was in the San Francisco office so I ended up sitting within the Tech, Media, and Telecom group. It was great because I learned about all these great internet and software companies.</p><p class="calibre_1">Following the Shutterfly IPO, which was led by JPMorgan, I joined Shutterfly as a business analyst. It was a great first role at an operating company because I supported a variety of functional areas with reporting and analysis, and I got to see how they spent their time. I got really interested in seeing how new features and changes to the UX (user experience) would affect customer engagement metrics and ultimately revenue. I also found that I really enjoyed working with engineers and designers; I wanted to be more involved in creating things to delight customers. A couple of years later, I left to pursue an MBA, mostly because I felt it would be an efficient way to move from analytics to product.</p><p class="calibre_1">I did a couple internships before and during business school - at oDesk and Amazon Web Services - which were a great way to get a taste for different company sizes, cultures, and sub-sectors. After business school, I joined SurveyMonkey’s product team. I started out as an individual contributor focusing on growth initiatives, like launching new plans and overhauling new user onboarding. I eventually grew into managing the platform team, which was responsible for things like identity, billing, and enterprise features.</p><p class="calibre_1">I left SurveyMonkey a few years later to lead product at Optimizely where I built the beginnings of the product team from the ground up. The role turned out to be a bit different from what I expected and wanted so I left after about six months. I decided to do some consulting work to get to know any potential team (and manager) before committing. After a couple months of spending two days per week at DocuSign, I was hooked. I converted to full time and am currently overseeing growth, which is really exciting given the stage of the company and viral nature of the product.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">What were some of the key breakthrough moments in your career?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">When I was working as a business analyst at Shutterfly, a PM left. Because I was already familiar with the metrics for that product line, I had the opportunity to step in and gain some PM experience. Having the opportunity to get some product work while at Shutterfly was crucial. Post-business school, I was able to reference this experience and provide concrete examples around product launches and tough UX decisions.</p><p class="calibre_1">I can’t say enough good things about SurveyMonkey. I feel so lucky to have had the opportunity to work there when I did. The leadership team is really great about growing talent and giving people the room and support they need. I would get a new project or responsibility, have no idea how to do it, figure it out with help from my boss and the team, and then take on additional new responsibilities before I had time to get bored.</p><p class="calibre_1">My current role was very much the result of being at the right place at the right time. I was introduced to DocuSign just as they were building out their product team. The company had a strong lineup of enterprise software veterans, but they were in the market for product folks from more consumer and UX-focused backgrounds. The result is that my role is a perfect mix of things I’ve done before that I’m very comfortable with and new challenges that push me outside of my comfort zone.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">What advice would you give to a PM who wants to advance in their career?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Join a company that’s experiencing (or, even better, about to experience) hyper-growth. The business will be growing faster than the team can scale so you’ll have lots of room to grow in terms of responsibility. The venture capital community can be a great resource here; they value meeting talent (you!) just as much as you value getting job leads so it’s a great symbiotic relationship.</p><p class="calibre_1">Make who you work with your top priority. They’re your best resource for learning. And since things in tech can get stressful, it’s important to make sure they’re genuinely good people. The best way to vet people is to work with people you’ve worked with before. That’s obviously tough in the beginning of your career, but with enough scrappiness you can probably find second or third degree connections. Another option is to “try before you buy” via consulting.</p><p class="calibre_1">It’s important to have a manager and executive leadership team you trust and believe in. It’s tempting to chase more senior roles at a startup early in your career, but I’m really thankful for the time I’ve spent working under experienced exes. At this point of my career, I’d rather work for someone I can learn from and ask questions of than be at the top.</p><p class="calibre_1">It sounds trite, but it’s a small Valley (and beyond). Good employers will do official and unofficial reference checks, so it’s important to actually be the person you want to be. That doesn’t just mean working hard and acting smart; it’s more being honest, staying humble, and genuinely caring about the team. Those are the things that make me want to work with someone.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_37"></div>
