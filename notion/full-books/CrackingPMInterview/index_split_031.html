<p id="filepos162614" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Transitioning from Designer to Product Manager</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">Designers have a great background to move into product management. If you feel like you don’t have the level of product influence you want, or if you feel like your analytical skills are being underutilized, then you might do well as a PM.</p><p class="calibre_1">Designers already are familiar with focusing on the customer and designing great products. Some companies have PMs do a lot of the interaction design, so those skills will still get a lot of use.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Practice Prioritization</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">One of the biggest changes in moving from design to product management is becoming responsible for prioritization. As a PM, you’ll be responsible for shipping the product, which means avoiding feature creep and scoping the implementation as you get more information from engineering on the costs.</p><p class="calibre_1">If you’ve been relying on your PM to tell you when to rein it in, now’s the time to start exercising those skills yourself. Sometimes you need to do things the quick and dirty way, and sometimes you need to cut a feature that would have made the product a lot more usable. As a designer, you can practice by prioritizing the pieces of your designs and discussing them with your PM. See if you’d make the same calls, and if not, try to understand what underlies the differences. Pay attention to what gets de-prioritized, either explicitly or implicitly, because the team runs out of time.</p><p class="calibre_1">A great way to hone your prioritization sense is to follow up on your designs after they’ve launched. See if you can talk to customers or read support tickets to learn if your prioritization was right. Are people complaining about a missing feature you wanted to cut? Or are they raving about something you fought to keep in? Most people discover that they can cut a lot more than they thought.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Sharpen Your Analytical Skills</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Analytical skills come into product management in two major ways: analyzing what your team should be doing and analyzing how to persuade people to do that thing. As a PM, you need to become comfortable with finding data that convinces people. That data is sometimes from product metrics, sometimes from user research, and sometimes from competitive analysis.</p><p class="calibre_1">See if you can find ways to demonstrate analytical skills as a designer. For example, maybe you can run a survey to get data that will help influence a design. Or maybe you can learn SQL and start pulling usage metrics. These skills will help you make the jump to PM.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Look for Leadership Opportunities</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">At some companies, designers are naturally in a leadership role, while at others you’ll need to look for places where you can take on more leadership. Can you become involved in roadmap discussions? Are there team meetings that you could offer to run? Maybe you can identify a project the team should be working on, pitch it, and rally people to work on it.</p><p class="calibre_1">Or perhaps your team’s PM is a bit swamped right now. Can you take some of the load off her plate? You might be able to spec something out for her or try your hand at analyzing some data. In many cases, a PM would be happy to help show you the ropes.</p><p class="calibre_1">Sometimes it feels awkward to take leadership roles when no one has given you permission. In those cases, you might need to “fake it until you make it.” Remember that scrappiness is highly valued in PMs. Being scrappy is about being resourceful and finding ways to succeed when the traditional processes aren’t going to work. For example, if you find that engineers are reluctant to fix UI bugs, you might come up with a contest that motivates them. That’s the kind of story that can really make a good impression.</p><blockquote class="calibre_23"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Transitioning from Customer Support</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_6">Paul, currently a senior product manager, used his understanding of customer pain points to move from tech support to product management.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_23">When customers wrote in saying something was broken, he would always ask them what they were trying to do in order to understand the underlying customer need. Then, when he filed bug reports, he included detailed descriptions of the problems, suggestions for potential ways to solve the problems, and ideas for new features that would help. The CEO noticed and asked him to become the company’s first product manager.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_23">Paul shared some advice about how to adapt from support to product: “In support you work with one customer at a time to solve their particular need and make them happy. As a PM you have to think about the user base as a whole. You need to think and talk about things in terms of the big picture. Articulate how an issue works in the bigger ecosystem.”</blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_31"></div>
