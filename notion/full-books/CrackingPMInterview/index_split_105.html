<p id="filepos689582" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Interview Questions</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">While not all interview questions fit cleanly into one of the categories below, many do – or at least overlap several categories. Below are the major types of case questions and how to approach them. These types include questions on strategy, marketing, launching, brainstorming, pricing, and problem solving.</p><p class="calibre_1">For each type of question, a structured approach is vital. Find a way to break down a problem into components and then tackle each part.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Strategy Questions</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Strategy questions include asking what a company’s strategy is or how to design a strategy. It’s important to think about a product’s strategy at two levels:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Micro:</span> What is the business model for the product? What steps is the company pursuing to succeed on that model? Will customers want it?</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Macro:</span> How does this product fit into the greater vision of the company? Will it open up new opportunities? Does it secure an existing market?</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">Many products will be strategic on both levels. For example, Amazon Kindle makes money on its own, but it <span class="italic">also</span> helps Amazon further secure its position as the go-to place to buy content.</p><p class="calibre_1">In discussing the micro- and macro- strategy, frameworks such as SWOT and the Five Forces might be particularly useful. Think about questions such as:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">What is the company’s mission?</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29">What are the company’s goals?</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29">What are the company’s strengths?</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29">What are the company’s weaknesses?</li><li value="5" class="calibre_29">How is the company leveraging its strengths or minimizing its weaknesses?</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">Thinking about these questions at the micro and macro level and then applying their actions to it could help you describe a company’s strategy.</p><p class="calibre_1">Potential strategies for decisions could include:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Diversifying revenue sources.</span> A company might want to diversify revenue sources so drastic changes in the market or the emergence of a new competitor doesn’t tank the company.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Building Barriers to Entry:</span> Building barriers to entry helps keep new competitors out and, therefore, protect a company’s revenue. For example, Facebook’s ownership of the social network makes it difficult (though not impossible) to successfully compete in the event management tools space.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Being the “One-Stop Shop for _____”:</span> A company might want to expand their product suite around a particular area as a barrier to entry for competitors. For example, due to its breadth of products, Amazon is seen as the place you go to for purchasing anything. Companies that threaten this in some way by leading in a particular product area are acquisition targets for Amazon.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Being the Low-Cost Leader:</span> Being the cheapest will cut your profit margins, but it will also make the industry less attractive to current and potential competitors. Note that there’s a difference between actively trying to ensure your prices are the cheapest and being forced to cut your price to compete. The former is a pro-active strategic decision; the latter is a consequence.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Reducing Reliance on a Key Buyer or Supplier:</span> Reliance on a single buyer can force you to meet their demands, and reliance on a supplier could cause unexpected delays or drops in quality.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Testing a New Market:</span> In some cases, a company will enter a new market with a niche product as a way of testing it out, building its brand, and learning more about the territory. The “real” product comes later.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">This list is just to give you a taste of what strategies could be underlying a decision. Many, many more strategies are out there. It might be useful during your interview preparation to keep a list of key strategies you see.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Example</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14"><span class="bold">Facebook bought Instagram for about $1 billion, even though Instagram was making no money. Why do you think Facebook did this?</span></p><p class="calibre_1">Answering this question does not require a strong knowledge of Instagram. That’s not what the interviewer cares about. A strong answer for someone who doesn’t know much about Instagram might look like the following:</p><blockquote class="calibre_23"><span class="italic">Hmm, interesting question. To be honest, I haven’t really used Instagram much, but I’m vaguely familiar with it. And I’m of course familiar with Facebook. Let me break this down by discussing the key components of the acquisition and then how those aligned with or threatened Facebook’s mission.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">Facebook’s mission is to connect people and help them share their lives. This acquisition involved acquiring three things: the company (employees), the product, and the users. Let’s think about these with respect to Facebook.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">While I’m sure Instagram had some very talented employees, the company was still pretty small at that time. I can’t imagine that was a strong driver of the $1 billion acquisition.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">The product is a bit more interesting. Instagram created a beautiful photo-sharing product, and this was probably pretty scary to Facebook. Photo sharing is really vital to a company whose mission is helping people share their lives; it was a big draw of Facebook and a key strength. But another company was truly excelling there and basically beating Facebook (at least in certain aspects) at its own game. What happens when people start increasingly using Instagram instead of Facebook for photo sharing? It’s a big threat.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">The users are the other big part of the acquisition. As I recall, Instagram had a ton of users as of the acquisition and had essentially built its own social network. This is of course what Facebook is all about and, again, Instagram had succeeded there. What happens as their social network grows? Will other companies (particularly creative sites like Etsy) start integrating with Instagram instead of Facebook? The size of Facebook’s user base is the big barrier to entry for competitors, and every social network loosens Facebook’s grip a bit.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">Ultimately, it seems like what Facebook might have seen is this hot, young startup which had suddenly started excelling in two areas of strength for Facebook: photos and community. Facebook probably felt they couldn’t afford to risk those areas or even allow another major player there. Plus, there also may have been a fear of what Instagram might do next – or what might happen if, say, Google got their hands on Instagram instead.</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_19">This candidate might have missed some aspects of the acquisition (such as an opportunity for Facebook to excel in mobile). That’s an understandable oversight for someone unfamiliar with Instagram or Facebook’s mobile strategy.</p><p class="calibre_1">Note how the candidate has structured her answer. She’s broken down the acquisition into its components, and then blended in some aspects of a SWOT analysis: strengths, weaknesses, and threats. This is one way the earlier frameworks might be applied.</p><p class="calibre_1">She then wrapped up her response with a clear, succinct conclusion.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Sample Questions</span></span></p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ol class="calibre_38"><li value="1" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Describe the strategy behind Google entering the cell phone market.</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Amazon has a number of independent websites that, in some ways, duplicate the functionality of Amazon: Zappos (shoes and clothing); Diapers.com (baby and kid needs); YoYo.com (kids’ toys); Look.com (kids’ clothing); Soap.com (toiletries); Casa.com (house products). What do you think their strategy is in maintaining so many different websites with such similar functionality? Do you agree or disagree with it?</span></li><li value="3" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">If you were Amazon, would you launch service in India? Why or why not? How would you do this?</span></li><li value="4" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Amazon has ads on its website for products you can buy on other websites. What do you think is the strategy there? Is it a good idea?</span></li><li value="5" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Do you think Apple should sell non-Apple products in its stores? Why or why not?</span></li><li value="6" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">If you were responsible for Microsoft phones, what would you do?</span></li><li value="7" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Which Google products or services don’t make sense to you? Why?</span></li><li value="8" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">If you were CEO of Yahoo!, what would your strategy be?</span></li><li value="9" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Imagine you’re starting up a new social networking service. What would your strategy be?</span></li><li value="10" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Imagine you were considering launching two services which have similar revenues and costs. How would you decide which one to pursue?</span></li></ol><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Marketing Questions</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Marketing questions are about product positioning, customers, and handling competition. The Marketing Mix (4 Ps) is particularly useful here in offering an idea of the elements you might discuss. Aspects of SWOT, the 5 Cs, and the Customer Purchase Decision Making Process also come in.</p><p class="calibre_1">In tackling these questions, you might try an approach like the following:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ol class="calibre_38"><li value="1" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Understand the Company:</span></span><span class="calibre4"> What are the company’s goals? What is its mission? What are its strengths and weaknesses? What threatens it?</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Understand the Competition:</span></span><span class="calibre4"> Break down the competition into segments. Who competes and in what market? How do they position themselves? How entrenched are they? What are their strengths and weaknesses?</span></li><li value="3" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Understand the Customers:</span></span><span class="calibre4"> Who are your customers? What desire or need is this product fulfilling? What is the purchase/usage behavior like (one time only, repeated purchases, etc.)?</span></li><li value="4" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Understand the Landscape:</span></span><span class="calibre4"> Are there legal issues? If you’re focusing on a particular region, what makes this region unique (e.g., frequent power outages)? What external forces are shaping your market?</span></li><li value="5" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Market Your Product:</span></span><span class="calibre4"> Using the information you discussed in the earlier steps, decide on aspects such as the product and its positioning and how you will promote it (think about the customer decision making process here). Depending on your interviewer and the question, you might also want to discuss pricing and distribution.</span></li></ol><p class="calibre_1">Note how a good chunk of the response covers just background information. That’s to be expected; the marketing plan should follow from that discussion.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Example Question</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14"><span class="bold">How would you market Windows Phone to developers (to encourage them to adopt it)?</span></p><blockquote class="calibre_23"><span class="italic">Well, let me first think a bit about what the market looks like right now, including the company, competition, customers, and general landscape.</span></blockquote><div class="calibre_47"> </div><ul class="calibre_48"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="italic">As I understand it, Microsoft’s goal with respect to developers is to increase the number of high quality apps. Windows Phone has fairly low market share right now, which is the main barrier to this happening: It’s just not interesting as a development platform. On the other hand, its strength is that Windows is dominant in the desktop market. This means ease of development and a strong brand name, at least in some senses. This is something for Microsoft to leverage.</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre_49"><span class="italic">The two biggest competitors are iPhone and Android. The iPhone is excelling in the higher-end market, which draws developers to the platform. The perception is that iPhone users download and spend more money on apps. The Android phone is interesting to developers due to its market share, but it can also be frustrating because of the large number of devices to support.</span></li><li value="3" class="calibre_49"><span class="italic">The customers, in this case, are the developers – but obviously their decision will be somewhat based on what users want as well. There are a lot of types of developers: hobbyists, enterprise developers, startup developers, etc. Developers want a fast and easy language to build a product with and the ability to push out their product to as many users as possible.</span></li><li value="4" class="calibre_49"><span class="italic">The last thing to discuss, before going into a potential marketing plan, is the environment. We want to think about any trends that might open up holes in the market. One trend is the relative gap in the enterprise market, left by Blackberry’s decline. The iPhone and the Android have filled in that gap a bit, but there may still be some room there (particularly if you can get the backing of IT/system administrators). Another relevant part of the environment is the diversity of phones from country to country. I don’t know the statistics on this, but I suspect there are some markets where iPhone and Android haven’t really dominated yet.</span></li></ul><blockquote class="calibre_6"><span class="italic">Now for the marketing plan: I think the key things we want to focus on are (1) making development on our platform as frictionless as possible; (2) ensuring the top apps on iPhone and Android also have a Windows Phone version; and (3) finding an opening in the market. Our positioning to developers is that we’ll make it easy to develop, maintain, and sell your app.</span></blockquote><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="calibre6"><span class="italic">As far as making development easy: We already have a leg up here, in that many developers already know Windows development. We need to create an excellent set of tutorials and sample code to teach Windows Phone development. Let’s try, if possible, to offer amazing APIs that developers can stick in their app to build key functionality – like plug-and-play coding.</span></span></li><li value="2" class="calibre_49"><span class="calibre6"><span class="italic">Additionally, because developers might struggle to find help on the web, we need to offer that help ourselves. We need to foster a community around Windows Phone development and offer free development support.</span></span></li><li value="3" class="calibre_49"><span class="calibre6"><span class="italic">We need to tackle where iPhone and Android are weaker in a development environment. I haven’t done much mobile development myself, but I’ve heard iPhone developers complain about the insufficient data on tracking where downloads came from. Let’s excel in this area.</span></span></li><li value="4" class="calibre_49"><span class="calibre6"><span class="italic">Ensuring that the top apps from both Android and iPhone are on Windows will take very proactive outreach. We need to track what apps are popular on those platforms. If they don’t have a Windows phone, give them one. We can possibly even help them with testing and support in order to bring the quality up to par, particularly if it’s just a single developer and not a full company or startup.</span></span></li><li value="5" class="calibre_49"><span class="calibre6"><span class="italic">The biggest market opening is probably in the enterprise space, so this might be where we want to focus. We can push for enterprise developers and IT folk to specialize in developing and supporting Windows Phones; many of them already do Windows development, so this isn’t a big stretch. If we offer better tools to support their employees, this might encourage them to pick Windows over iPhone and Android for company-provided phones.</span></span></li></ul><blockquote class="calibre_23"><span class="italic">This plan is designed to communicate to developers that we have a full ecosystem of tools: tutorials, APIs, technical support, free devices, community, analytics, administration tools, etc. This will differentiate us in the eyes of developers; we’re putting them first to make us the fastest and easiest phone to develop for and support.</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_19">This isn’t necessarily the best or only acceptable marketing plan. There are many marketing plans that might be acceptable here—even ones that lead to an entirely different and contrary conclusion.</p><p class="calibre_1">After all, you aren’t provided with data, so you have to rely on what you know—or think—to be true. If you’re misinformed about something, you could wind up making a recommendation that your interviewer knows would utterly flop. A good interviewer might mark you off a little for the misinformation (since industry knowledge can be important), but should evaluate the rest of your response taking your understanding to be “fact.”</p><p class="calibre_1">Remember the goal of these questions is showing you can apply structure to an open-ended problem, make good business decisions, and think wisely about a product’s marketing. You can do all of these things even with “bad” information.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Sample Questions</span></span></p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ol class="calibre_38"><li value="1" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">What is a product you think is marketed well? How would you improve it?</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">How would you market Gmail in China?</span></li><li value="3" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">How would you market the Android tablet?</span></li><li value="4" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">What do you think of Google’s marketing for its social products? How would you improve it?</span></li><li value="5" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">How would you market the next version of Windows?</span></li><li value="6" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">How would you choose a market for expansion for Amazon Web Services?</span></li><li value="7" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Discuss how you think Whole Foods is currently marketed. What works well? What could they do better?</span></li><li value="8" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">How would you market a mobile app to track weight, calorie consumption, and exercise?</span></li><li value="9" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">How would you market Google Docs to schools?</span></li><li value="10" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Describe how you would market a magazine subscription service for Kindle.</span></li></ol><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Launching Questions</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Launching products is one of the most important duties of a PM, so it makes sense that interviewers would ask how you would do this.</p><p class="calibre_1">To tackle these questions, the following approach might work well:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ol class="calibre_38"><li value="1" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">The Product:</span></span><span class="calibre4"> Discuss the vision of the product, along with its strengths, weaknesses, and risks. What does the product ultimately hope to achieve? What is its target market? What are the things that would worry you? Who is it competing against and how is it positioned against those?</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Launch Goals:</span></span><span class="calibre4"> Determine the goals of the launch. Do you want as many users as possible? Do you want to ensure profitability upfront? Do you want to validate that the product meets the market’s needs? Do you want to ensure a positive reaction (even at the expense of slower growth)?</span></li><li value="3" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Launch Design:</span></span><span class="calibre4"> Now that you know the goals, determine how you will achieve those. What market would be a good test bed? Will you control growth through an invitation system? Will you roll out just a limited version of the product so you can launch earlier? Will you try to make the biggest possible splash and get as many users as possible?</span></li><li value="4" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Launch Implementation (Pre + During + Post):</span></span><span class="calibre4"> With the basic design set, you now need to actually describe how you would implement this design. Break down your approach into three phases: pre-launch tasks, launch tasks, and post-launch tasks. Launching is not just a day-of process.</span></li></ol><p class="calibre_1">Your launch implementation discussion should cover the following aspects, possibly for each phase of launch:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Target Market:</span> Will you initially launch for just a particular city or a particular school? What is your initial target market?</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">User Types / Components:</span> If there are multiple types of users (e.g., drivers and riders), we may launch to these users separately: at different times and in different ways.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">MVP or Full Product:</span> Will you launch an early minimum-viable product (MVP), or will you wait until the product is fairly full featured?</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Distribution:</span> What stores and sales channels will carry your product? What platforms will you launch on?</li><li value="5" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Rollout:</span> When will it launch to different types of users? Are you going to start with a private beta? Will invitations be required?</li><li value="6" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Buzz:</span> How will you build buzz around your product (or will you)? Who will you reach out to? How will you get them on board? What do you want them to say about your product?</li><li value="7" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Partnerships:</span> Are there any partnerships that will help you to achieve your vision?</li><li value="8" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Risks:</span> What are the risks of the product, and how can you mitigate them? Are there legal challenges? Do you worry about a backlash from customers about privacy changes?</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">In thinking about these decisions, it might be useful to think about the Customer Purchase Decision Making Process. Which parts will be the most challenging? How will you overcome that?</p><p class="calibre_1">Some of the possible launch activities are depicted in the below figure<sup class="calibre11"><small id="filepos715215" class="calibre12"><a href="#filepos763137">2</a></small></sup>.</p><p class="calibre_2"><img src="images/00010.jpg" class="calibre_50"/><br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="calibre_31"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Example Question</span></span><a></a></p><p class="calibre_14">Imagine you’re building a service to connect people with a recommendations/booking service for local service providers (plumbers, etc.) – like an OpenTable for service providers. How would you launch this product?</p><p class="calibre_1">A candidate could respond with an answer like the following.</p><blockquote class="calibre_23"><span class="italic">Okay, just to get this straight, what I’m imagining is a place where people could search for, say, a plumber or an electrician and see reviews. They could probably request an open time slot (if that’s possible) or post a job and get bids.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">When I think about this product, it feeds a clear need. I don’t know of other direct competitors to this.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">One of the challenges we’ll face – and thus one of the things we’ll need to design our launch around – is that it’s a chicken and egg problem. We have two types of users: service providers and clients. Service providers won’t want to join until there are enough clients, and clients won’t want to join until there are enough service providers.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">The other challenge I suspect we’ll face is being top of mind when a user needs a service provider. We’re trying to change user behavior, and that’s always hard.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">We want to design our launch to handle these two issues. In fact, given the challenges we’re up against and given the odds that we won’t get things quite right the first time, I think it’s important we launch early with a minimum viable product.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">To tackle the first problem, we’ll want to establish a strong user base of service providers first in a focused area (ideally, an affluent area with a lot of homeowners). We’ll do a controlled launch where we can throttle client signup if it gets too high relative to the number of providers.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">To tackle the second problem, we’ll need to make ourselves more top of mind. The best way to do this is probably by focusing on services that are more regularly used: housecleaners, drivers, gardeners, pool cleaners, etc.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">I think we’ll need to launch, at the minimum, both a web client and mobile client for providers, and one or the other for clients. The providers need both since the mobile client allows them to take bookings on-the-go, and the web will help support providers without phones. For clients, I’d suggest that we start off with a web client. I do think the mobile client is really important, but it requires building for multiple operating systems. Given that we need to get something out ASAP, I think it’s best to just do one for now.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">In the months before launch, we’ll start with getting providers signed up. They are less likely to get turned off than clients are by a mismatch in supply or demand for providers.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">We’ll pull providers from two places. First, we’ll pull them from review sites such as Yelp and from community blogs and forums. Second, we’ll reach out to real estate agents. They tend to be a go-to place for advice for new homeowners. We want them to know about our product, and we also want their list of recommended providers. An active sales force will be necessary to do this.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">For the launch to clients, we’ll do an invite-only, slow launch. We want to incentivize people to invite their friends though, so we may offer some sort of credit to people who invite their friends.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">To build buzz, we’ll also want to engage with the local community. We could have physical signage at popular cafes, reach out to local blogs, use Facebook groups about the community, etc. A lot of areas have their own newspapers, so we could try that too.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">Post-launch, we want to analyze metrics on signups, conversion, etc. One of the things I expect we’ll find is that many people sign up and then forget to use us when an issue comes up. We will need to track this carefully, as this will be a big challenge for us.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">It’s not just a numbers game, though: We really need to build a strong relationship with the service providers. We want them to be advocates for the site. If they can encourage existing clients to use it, then those clients may use it for other services, too. We also need their feedback to enable us to perfect the site.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">So, to recap, we’re doing the following: We’ll build a mobile and web client for providers, and just a web client for users. We’ll solicit providers through Yelp, community blogs and forums, and real estate agents, paying particular attention to recurring services such as gardeners and cleaners. We’ll launch in a localized community – Silicon Valley is probably a good candidate – getting as many providers signed up as possible. The service will be gradually rolled out to clients with an invite-only registration. We’ll maintain strong relationships with providers and clients and make it a point to excel in customer service. This will ensure we get the feedback we need to refine our product.</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_19">This candidate has recognized that this is really two launches in one: a consumer launch and a provider launch. He has then walked through how to launch in both of those markets and discussed key problems we might face.

Interviewers want to see that you aren’t stuck in a mindset of just doing the same old thing. They want to know you can come up with “big, hairy, audacious ideas.”</p><p class="calibre_1">For some people, this is difficult. They’re scared of looking stupid, or they just get flustered and think too linearly.</p><p class="calibre_1">If you’re asked a brainstorming question, try to:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ol class="calibre_38"><li value="1" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Suspend disbelief.</span></span><span class="calibre4"> It’s okay to name a few stupid ideas, particularly because so-called “stupid” ideas are often the crazy ideas that get interviewers excited. Getting caught up in “Is this even good enough to mention?” is a good way to kill your creativity. Let your imagination run wild!</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Think about strengths and key assets</span></span><span class="calibre4">. If you find yourself stumped coming up with more ideas, try to forget about what the product is and just think about what its strengths and key features are. For example, consider a grocery cart. Its strengths are that it can hold a lot and that it is relatively compact (carts can be “stacked” inside each other). A key feature is that it is on wheels. What can you do with those?</span></li><li value="3" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Think about one vs. many.</span></span><span class="calibre4"> The use cases when you just have a single object might be different than when you have many. For example, one golf ball could be used to play a game. A pile of many golf balls could be used to weight down a tarp in the wind.</span></li><li value="4" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Think about as-is vs. with modifications.</span></span><span class="calibre4"> An object can be used as-is or it can be used with modifications. If you can do modifications to the object, the scope gets much broader.</span></li></ol><p class="calibre_1">Ideally, you want to go for “structured creativity.” Structure shows organized thinking and helps your interviewer remember your answer better. However, don’t let your structure get in the way of your communication.</p><p class="calibre_1">After you’re done brainstorming, your interviewer might ask you to go into one of your ideas in more detail.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Example Question</span></span><a></a></p><p class="calibre_51"><span class="bold">Name some innovative ideas for a vending machine.</span></p><p class="calibre_1">There are many ways to respond to this question. Here’s one of them.</p><blockquote class="calibre_23"><span class="italic">Interesting. Let me think for a moment.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">Okay, so first, we can use a vending machine to sell things other than the standard food and drinks. We can sell basically any small object. We could use a vending machine to sell beer at a bar, or we could use it to sell small electronics, cosmetics, etc.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">It could be used outside of just the standard “sell small object” situation, though.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">What a vending machine is good at is distributing exactly one copy of something – without breaking it – in a totally automated way. The automation is interesting because someone doesn’t have to be present. Where else could this be used?</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">It could be used as an alternative to stores. Perhaps the owners of a small store could use a vending machine as a way to sell a limited amount of their merchandise while they’re closed. They could even use it to speed up the sale of some express items during busy times of the day.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">Or, if there were a way of modifying the vending machine so that people could insert items back into it, this could be used to rent things such as phone chargers. The beauty of that is if the person doesn’t return it, you have their credit card on file.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">This might even be useful for situations where merchandize is too valuable to leave just sitting out. A lot of stores have pricier items such as razor blades in locked shelves, and customers have to get a clerk to unlock it. If people could just swipe their credit card and pay instantly, it’d be better for everyone.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">Okay, let me try to think even more abstractly now. A vending machine has the following attributes or components:</span></blockquote><div class="calibre_47"> </div><ul class="calibre_48"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="italic">A big glass window showing the items.</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre_49"><span class="italic">A refrigerator.</span></li><li value="3" class="calibre_49"><span class="italic">The ability to locate a specific item on a shelf in an automated way.</span></li><li value="4" class="calibre_49"><span class="italic">A credit card processor.</span></li><li value="5" class="calibre_49"><span class="italic">A change machine.</span></li><li value="6" class="calibre_49"><span class="italic">Some way to validate that cash isn’t counterfeit.</span></li><li value="7" class="calibre_49"><span class="italic">A way to prevent people from sticking their hand in and grabbing a bunch of items.</span></li></ul><blockquote class="calibre_6"><span class="italic">It’s also very heavy and automated.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">We could use the glass window to display other types of items – small pieces of art, perhaps. We can use the refrigerator as a normal fridge.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">We could also combine some parts. For example, if we had an old vending machine lying around, it could probably be modified to let people withdraw cash from their credit cards.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">This ability to locate items at a specific row and column is interesting. Presumably it could also do this for multiple items at once. This sort of automation could be very useful in some industries, particularly when they want to reduce human error. Perhaps for pharmacists or doctors to distribute drugs and know they have the right one.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">I think that’s a pretty good list for now. Would you like me to keep going, or is there one particular idea you’d like me to dive into?</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_19">This candidate went with a “broadening” approach. The answer started with a pretty straightforward list of use cases for a vending machine, which used the technology in “expected” ways. Then, later, the answer broke down the machine by component and discussed other ways of using those components.</p><p class="calibre_1">He potentially could have gone even broader. He could have discussed uses for a group of vending machines, or he could have analyzed modifications to the machine that could make it behave in different ways.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Sample Questions</span></span><a></a></p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ol class="calibre_38"><li value="1" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Suppose you’re a manufacturer of paper clips and have realized people no longer need paper clips.

In an ideal world, we’d have supply and demand charts that express how sales volume would change based on the pricing. We would then be able to pinpoint exactly when profit is maximized.</p><p class="calibre_1">In the real world, we don’t have any of this data. The goal – to maximize profit – is still the same, but the process is different. People generally use any or all of the following to price a product:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Cost-Plus Pricing:</span> Examine the costs of your product and set your price a little higher than that. This is tricky because there are generally fixed costs and marginal costs, so it’s difficult to assess the cost per unit. Additionally, many online services don’t have direct costs, and the costs don’t determine whether this is a <span class="italic">reasonable</span> price. However, the cost of your product does suggest a minimum price (presuming you want to make a profit) and indicates something about your competitor’s prices.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Value Pricing:</span> Some products have a clear and direct value to the customer. In those cases, you might be able to estimate how much money/time you are saving (or gaining for) the customer and price accordingly.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Competitive Pricing:</span> A great number of products are priced by just looking at the competitors’ prices. This is partially rational (because your customers might otherwise select your competitors) and partially due to laziness (because people don’t know how else to price a product). Pricing lower than your competitors is not necessarily a good thing; it can signal lower quality to customers, and it might start a price war. However, competitive pricing can still be a starting point from which you decide to price higher if your product is positioned as a premium product.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Experimental Pricing:</span> In some cases, it’s possible for a company to experiment with different prices and then correlate price with sales volume. Proceed with caution here, though; inconsistent pricing can frustrate or anger customers.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">A thorough company might use cost-based pricing, value pricing, and competitive pricing to triangulate on a good price, and then tweak it slightly with experiments.</p><p class="calibre_1">With these general approaches in mind, there are a number of pricing models to consider:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Free, Ad-Supported:</span> Many startups try this approach, but few succeed. Advertising alone is rarely enough to support a company, unless there is something unique about your product which makes advertising particularly effective.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Freemium:</span> In a freemium model, a basic level of the product is free but a premium version is paid. This can be good for attracting customers. However, you have to keep a close eye on your costs for supporting these free users, as well as on your conversion rate.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Tiered:</span> A company might offer multiple levels of pricing, segmented by volume, customer type, or features. You don’t want to go overboard, though; too many tiers can be overwhelming for customers.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">À La Carte:</span> A company can price each feature or service separately, letting the customer choose exactly which “upgrades” they would like. This can often lead to customers paying more than they would have for a bundled suite of features. Some customers will like this flexibility but others will be overwhelmed by it. The support costs of dealing with so many different suites of features can also be challenging.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Subscriptions:</span> Many services offer subscriptions to their product or service, particularly in the case of web applications. Some products are simultaneously available for purchase and as a subscription. This enables products to capture customers who only need temporary usage and may not be willing to make the upfront investment in a full purchase.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Free Trial:</span> Short-term trials can be a good way to let customers experiment with a product before the purchase, as a way to “hook” them. Trials can be bounded by time, number of uses, or particular features (e.g., you can import but not export). You have to be careful to ensure a good enough experience that customers will enjoy the product but not so good that they don’t desire to upgrade.</li><li value="7" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Razor Blade Model:</span> A company can sell one component (e.g., razors) at, near, or below costs with the expectation that an add-on component (e.g., razor blades) will bring in additional revenue. This can work very well if the customer can only buy these add-on components from you. If there are other competitors with compatible add-ons, then you run the risk of customers purchasing the product from you cheaply and then the add-ons from your competitor. No one wins (except for the customer).</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">A pricing model could use a combination of many of these attributes. For example, a company could offer subscriptions to its service, priced differently depending on the size of the customer’s business, with additional upgrades purchased à la carte.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Online Advertising</span></span><a></a></p><p class="calibre_14">As many tech companies (most notably Google and Facebook) have advertising-based business models, pricing questions around advertising come up particularly often.</p><p class="calibre_1">Questions about advertising can seem complicated, but actually they usually break down into a handful of standard ratios such as click-through-rate (CTR), cost-per-click (CPC), and conversion rate. Once you start thinking about the problem in terms of those ratios, getting to an answer is usually pretty easy.</p><p class="calibre_1">You will need to understand the basics of how online advertising works, though. Here’s a quick overview.</p><p class="calibre_1">Online advertising is generally priced one of two ways:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Pay-Per-Click:</span> An advertiser pays only when a person clicks on their ad. This means that if their ad is shown 1,000 times but only clicked twice, the advertiser would only pay for those two clicks.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Pay-Per-Impression:</span> An advertiser pays every time the ad is shown, regardless of whether or not the user interacts with the ad.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Pay-Per-Action:</span> An advertiser pays only when an action is performed (e.g., the customer clicks on the ad and purchases the product). This is also called a “conversion.” This is a rarely used model, in part because of the difficulty of tracking conversions.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">Google and Facebook offer both pay-per-click and pay-per-impression advertising. Additionally, Facebook offers pay-per-action advertising, with the allowable actions including “liking” a page, claiming an offer, and installing a mobile app.</p><p class="calibre_1">At Google and Facebook, as well as other companies with advertising, the price of an ad is typically determined via an auction.</p><p class="calibre_1">Cost-per-click advertising is the type more commonly discussed. The price you pay for each click is called the cost-per-click (CPC). In the auction, you bid based on the CPC you’re willing to spend.</p><p class="calibre_1">Another key metric is the percent of times your ad is clicked, called the click-through-rate (CTR). To calculate how much you’d pay to have your ad shown one thousand times, a metric called CPM, you can multiply: CPC * CTR * 1,000. For example, if the cost-per-click (CPC) were $1.50, and the click-through-rate (CTR) were 2%, then the CPM would be $30.</p><p class="calibre_1">Generally, the most an advertiser would be willing to pay for an ad (that is, a click on an ad) is the expected profit from that click. To calculate the expected profit from a click, you want to know what percent of people who click on that advertisement will actually make a purchase (conversion rate). Then, multiply conversion rate * profit per conversion.</p><blockquote class="calibre_23"><span class="calibre6"><tt class="calibre10">max for ad</tt></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre6"><tt class="calibre10">= expected profit per click</tt></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre6"><tt class="calibre10">= conversion rate * profit per conversion</tt></span></blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_31">If you were asked to calculate how much you would pay for advertising for a particular product, you might need to estimate the conversion rate and the profit per conversion. Conversion rates vary substantially by industry but are usually between 2% and 5% on Google search ads.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Example Question</span></span><a></a></p><p class="calibre_51"><span class="bold">How would you price a personalized notebook?</span></p><p class="calibre_1">Consider the following response:</p><blockquote class="calibre_23"><span class="italic">Since it’s personalized, I’ll assume this is a premium notebook, probably leather (or faux-leather) bound.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">First of all, let me think about who the market is. It feels like the market for this is probably consumers, but it’s possible there’s also some market for companies as a promotional item. Both would be good avenues to discuss.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">There are a few different aspects of pricing to consider.</span></blockquote><div class="calibre_47"> </div><ul class="calibre_48"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="italic">How much do nice moleskin-like notebooks cost? I’ve bought one or two, and they’re fairly expensive—around $15 - $20.</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre_49"><span class="italic">How much do other personalized products cost? We’re competing in this market too, so we need to be aware of this. Personalized products can obviously be very expensive, but you rarely see personalized products for much less than $10. When I’ve looked for personalized gifts, there were a lot around $15 - $50.</span></li></ul><blockquote class="calibre_6"><span class="italic">How much do our customers generally spend on gifts? A $20 gift is about the low-end of gift buying, at least for professionals (who are the most likely people to buy this product).</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">What sort of premium will people pay for personalization? We could survey customers to guess at this, but that’s only somewhat accurate. A 50% - 100% premium seems about right.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">How much does it cost us to make it? I have the least visibility into this. However, based on the prices of other products, I’m guessing that it takes at least the cost of the notebook itself, plus the cost of personalization. If a moleskin notebook is sold online for $20, then it’s probably sold to the distributor for a 50% or so markup. The distributor also probably has profit margins of around 50%, so let’s say that a moleskin notebook costs $5 to make. Personalization probably adds another few dollars on top of that.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">It feels as though we’re narrowing in on a pricing of about $35 for a nice, personalized notebook.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">I suspect there’s a market there for companies as a promotional item with the company logo engraved. We can offer volume discounts on large purchases of the notebook. This would incentivize large sales and offer an alternative to a lot of less classy promotional items.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">Volume discounts wouldn’t drop the cost of production of the notebooks (since those were already produced at a discount), but it probably does drop the price of engraving. Our costs are probably around $7, so that gives a lower bound on our price. For high volume sales, a price of $15 seems right; that gives us 50% profit margins. We probably don’t want to go much below this.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">The rest of the prices follow roughly from there:</span></blockquote><div class="calibre_47"> </div><ul class="calibre_48"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="italic">1 – 10 notebooks: $35. I suspect the economies of scale don’t kick in until after this point.</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre_49"><span class="italic">10 – 30 notebooks: $30.</span></li><li value="3" class="calibre_49"><span class="italic">30 – 100 notebooks: $20.</span></li><li value="4" class="calibre_49"><span class="italic">100+ notebooks: $15.</span></li></ul><blockquote class="calibre_6"><span class="italic">Of course, we’d want to tweak the prices based on data and actual sales. Since it’s an actual physical product without ongoing customers to support, we could change the prices periodically without people getting too angry.”</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_19">This candidate has used a variety of approaches to understand what a reasonable price is. She’s evaluated how willing a person would be to pay a particular amount, based on the alternatives. In this case, alternatives include other notebooks, other personalized options, and other gifts in general. She has also validated this price against an estimation of the costs.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Sample Questions</span></span><a></a></p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ol class="calibre_38"><li value="1" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">Describe a product or service you think takes an interesting approach to pricing.</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">You are launching a new music service where you pay per time you play a song.

This could be almost anything, but here are some ideas to get you started:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">Has this happened in all regions?</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29">How many product lines do we have? Has this happened in all our products?</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29">Have competitors had similar issues, to the best of our knowledge?</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29">Have other related products experienced the same effect?</li><li value="5" class="calibre_29">Have we seen any seasonality?</li><li value="6" class="calibre_29">Have we made any changes to our product line?</li><li value="7" class="calibre_29">Have new competitors entered the market?</li><li value="8" class="calibre_29">If we separate our customers by new versus returning, what differences do we see?</li><li value="9" class="calibre_29">How is customer retention?</li><li value="10" class="calibre_29">What have customers been saying? Have we been getting more complaints recently?</li><li value="11" class="calibre_29">Do we notice any changes in referral traffic?</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">Once you’ve diagnosed the problem, you might be asked to resolve it. Clarify the goals before you go on to doing this.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Example Question</span></span></p><p class="calibre_51"><span class="bold">You are working for Amazon in their clothing category when you discover that the sale of jeans has steadily declined during the past three months. How would you figure out what happened?</span></p><p class="calibre_1">You might approach this question as follows:</p><blockquote class="calibre_23"><span class="italic">Interesting. Okay, so the sale volume has dropped. I’ll assume this was a substantial drop. I need to understand more about what happened.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">The three month thing is particularly curious. It seems that something happened with jeans, with clothing, with Amazon, with online commerce, or just with time.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">I think it’s fair to rule out a big issue with online commerce or Amazon.com. Presumably, if those had experienced major drops, we’d know about it and have bigger issues to worry about. Likewise, let’s rule out a decline in clothing on Amazon since, presumably, we wouldn’t be so concerned about jeans if it were a clothing-wide issue.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">The time issue is interesting. Comparing sales to three months ago isn’t necessarily a good idea. Jeans are probably not sold at a steady rate year round. It’d be better to compare the sales to a year earlier to rule out seasonality. Let’s assume, though, that this still reveals an issue.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">You’ve also said it’s a steady decline. This means that it’s probably not, for example, a single UI change that caused the issue. That would cause a sudden decline instead.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">At this point, I’d like to get an understanding of how the sales have been within the jeans category.</span></blockquote><div class="calibre_47"> </div><ul class="calibre_48"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="italic">Have all jeans faced a decline? Or just particular brands?</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre_49"><span class="italic">Has Zappos experienced a similar decline with jeans? Since Amazon owns Zappos, we could likely get this information.</span></li></ul><blockquote class="calibre_6"><span class="italic">Let’s say it was all jeans on Amazon, but that Zappos did not experience an issue. This isolates the problem to something specific that we did.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">Sales volume is a function of visitors and conversion rate. If sales dropped, then one or both of those must have changed.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">We could break down both visitors and conversion rate by type of visitor: Amazon search traffic (people searching on Amazon.com), browse traffic (people browsing to get to the right category), external search traffic (search engine traffic, such as from Google), and direct traffic (people going directly to a particular product).</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">Our goal is to look for which of these experienced a decline either in the number of visitors or in conversion rate. If, for example, external search saw a drop in traffic, then we could investigate what changes we had made that might have affected our pagerank.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">If we don’t see a difference within these types of users, then we’ll want to look elsewhere for something that might have impacted sales. For example, it might be that the price of jeans increased substantially. It’s also possible (though hopefully unlikely) that there was an error in the searching/buying process that caused a decline.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">This is the basic process I’d go through. Is there a particular aspect you’d like me to drill into further?</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_19">This candidate has paid close attention to the wording of the question. It’s a <span class="italic">gradual</span> decline across a type of product. This should be a clue to what might be causing the problem.</p><p class="calibre_1">The candidate has also struck a good balance between outlining a general approach to solve the problem and using appropriate instincts to guide the direction (e.g., it’s unlikely that jeans suddenly stopped selling well).</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Sample Questions</span></span><a></a></p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ol class="calibre_38"><li value="1" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4">You notice the advertising revenue on your website has dropped considerably.
