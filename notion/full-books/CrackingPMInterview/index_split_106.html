Not so fast.</p><p class="calibre_1">Many companies, including Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, sometimes ask their PM candidates coding and algorithm questions. These questions can range from straightforward coding questions to more complex algorithm questions (which may or may not be followed up with a request to code).</p><p class="calibre_1">The good news is the expectations are generally lower than they would be for a developer. Many, but not all, interviewers will be satisfied with pseudocode.</p><blockquote class="calibre_23">Note: Programming code can be difficult to read on a Kindle's narrow screen, since it causes line breaks in the wrong places. If your Kindle support landscape mode, you might want to try that. (This is supported with the Kindle Paperwhite.) Otherwise, try reading it on the desktop app (resize the application to have a larger page size and increase the words per line).</blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_106"></div>
