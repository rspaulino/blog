Sometimes the trick is to be persistent. Focus on how your skills can be applicable to product management, and don’t stop reaching out to companies.</p><p class="calibre_1">Here are some skills you can emphasize when looking for PM roles:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold">Analysis.</span></span><span class="calibre6"> Do you work with data at your current job? Are you an Excel ninja? Many software companies are looking for data-driven PMs who can make sense of metrics and draw insights from usage patterns.</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre_25"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold">Customer Focus.</span></span><span class="calibre6"> Are you in a customer-facing role? Have you learned how to translate customer feedback into action? Companies love product managers who understand customers and their needs.</span></li><li value="3" class="calibre_25"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold">Business Savvy.</span></span><span class="calibre6"> Are you comfortable putting together business cases? Do you know how to size a market? Your experience can be a real asset in making the right business decisions.</span></li><li value="4" class="calibre_25"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold">Marketing.</span></span><span class="calibre6"> Do you have a background in marketing? Can you effectively communicate the value of a product? Marketing skills can help a PM design a product that will do well in the marketplace.</span></li><li value="5" class="calibre_25"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold">Industry Expertise.</span></span><span class="calibre6"> Do you have deep knowledge of how your industry works? If so, you have a leg up on applying to PM jobs in that industry. Your understanding of the industry means you can be a productive PM in a short amount of time.</span></li><li value="6" class="calibre_25"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold">Helpfulness.</span></span><span class="calibre6"> Could your team use some product management help? Do you have some extra capacity to step in? Many people slide into the PM role just by helping out when there was a gap.</span></li></ul><p class="calibre_1">When trying to jump to a PM role, compare these PM skills to those required or demonstrated with your current position. You’ll need to find ways to patch up gaps in your experience and skill set.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Use Your Network</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Don’t underestimate the power of networking to help you break into product management. Especially if you’ve demonstrated relevant skills, having a co-worker speak up for you can make the difference in convincing a team to take a chance on you.</p><p class="calibre_1">Sara, who went from partner technology manager at Google to product manager at Twitter shared: “it was really critical that I knew people. I got in the door through the people I knew. Originally there wasn’t any PM role open; they didn’t need any more PMs. These people really advocated for me. They had worked with me at Google and were able to vouch for me. I got into the company as an internal tools PM. Then once I was in the company, I transitioned to a consumer facing team.”</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_32"></div>
