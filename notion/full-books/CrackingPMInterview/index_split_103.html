<p id="filepos668403" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Useful Frameworks</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">An MBA is not required for most product management jobs, and thus most business frameworks are not necessary to tackle problems. After all, many of your interviewers wouldn’t know the frameworks either.</p><p class="calibre_1">However, understanding them can be useful anyway. The frameworks can suggest a structure for a problem or point you to an area you might otherwise have missed. Just don’t try to whip out the frameworks and force fit them to a problem. <span class="italic">Structure</span> matters, but regurgitating frameworks does not.</p><p class="calibre_1">Don’t worry about memorizing these frameworks; you won’t be expected to know them. Just read them over to get a sense for the types of structure that can be used to answer a question. A framework is just a structure for taking a big, complicated problem and breaking it down into smaller pieces. Whenever you hear a Case Question, you should think about how you can break it down into smaller questions. These frameworks give examples of ways to do that.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Customer Purchase Decision Making Process</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">There are many frameworks to model the decision-making process, but two of the most common are AIDA and REAN.</p><p class="calibre_1">AIDA models customer decisions as Attention (or Awareness) -&gt; Interest -&gt; Desire -&gt; Action.</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Attention:</span> You need to get the customer’s attention somehow. A snappy email heading, perhaps? A snazzy ad? Or maybe a mention from a trusted friend or website?</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Interest:</span> Now that you have the customer’s attention, you need to get them interested in your offering. What are the advantages or benefits of your product?</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Desire:</span> With the customer’s interest piqued, you need to convince the customer that they want your product.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Action:</span> Finally, with the customer desiring your product, they take action to purchase the product.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">REAN expands this to add on post-purchase behavior.</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Reach:</span> The customer is aware of your product.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Engage:</span> The customer is engaged and considering your product.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Activate:</span> The customer takes action to purchase the product.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Nurture:</span> The customer has purchased the product, and it’s now your responsibility to nurture this relationship.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">Don’t worry about which framework to use. Again, the specific framework isn’t relevant. The point is to understand purchase behavior as a cycle wherein the customer must first be aware of your product, then they have to evaluate it against their needs and competitors’ offerings, and then they finally purchase it. After the purchase decision, the customer relationship continues and your company should likely work to foster a strong relationship.</p><p class="calibre_1">This framework might be useful in discussing how you would market a new product. You might discuss that getting the customer’s attention will be fairly easy, but the “action” part (getting the user to actually switch from your competitor to you) will be more difficult.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Marketing Mix (4 Ps)</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">The “Marketing Mix” (also called the 4 Ps) is a way to understand the different aspects of a product’s approach to marketing.</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Product:</span> This is, of course, the actual item being offered. It should cater to a customer’s wants or needs.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Price:</span> The price will determine how many and what type of customers purchase the product. Pricing can be more complex for online products and services as compared to physical products. For example, an online storage service could have a one-month free trial, followed by discounted pricing for non-profits, with additional “a la carte” purchases for an automatic backup utility.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Promotion:</span> Promotion encompasses all forms of advertising, PR, word of mouth, and sales staff. For example, promotion for a kids’ product could include freebies given out to influential bloggers.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Place:</span> A physical product’s distribution (“place”) can include things such as online sales through Amazon, opening their own stores like Apple, distribution in retail stores, and sales through their own website. Greater distribution is not always better; many companies prefer to control the sales experience by limiting the sales channels. For online products, “place” might just be a single website, or it might include bundling the product with another company’s offerings.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">For online products, promotion can become very complex. A lot of products are competing for the customer’s attention, and advertising is often insufficient to drive sales.</p><p class="calibre_1">This framework could be useful to discuss the different elements of a marketing plan for a new or existing product.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">SWOT Analysis</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">SWOT analysis is a structure to analyze companies and products.</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Strengths:</span> Strengths are the <span class="italic">internal</span> factors that benefit a product. This can include anything about the costs, product features, company culture, reputation, infrastructure, or other aspects. For example, in considering launching the Kindle, one of Amazon’s strengths would be that it is already the place where customers buy books online.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Weaknesses:</span> Weaknesses are <span class="italic">internal</span> factors that introduce challenges for a product. For example, if a web company were to consider creating a physical device, a weakness might be that it doesn’t have experience with distribution.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Opportunities:</span> Opportunities have an <span class="italic">external</span> focus and relate to factors such as market growth, technology changes, competition, and legal regulations. For example, the growing cost of healthcare creates an opportunity for a product that gives better insight into one’s health.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Threats:</span> Threats are the <span class="italic">external</span> challenges a product faces. For example, the unpredictability in energy usage regulation poses a threat for many clean energy products.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">The following matrix represents the SWOT structure:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><table valign="top" class="calibre7"><tr valign="top" class="calibre8"><td valign="top" class="calibre_40"/><td valign="top" class="calibre_40"><p class="calibre_31"><span class="bold">GOOD</span></p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre_40"><p class="calibre_31"><span class="bold">BAD</span></p></td></tr><tr valign="top" class="calibre8"><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_31"><span class="bold">INTERNAL</span></p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_31">strengths</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_31">weaknesses</p></td></tr><tr valign="top" class="calibre8"><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_31"><span class="bold">EXTERNAL</span></p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_31">opportunities</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_31">threats</p></td></tr></table><p class="calibre_1">This framework can help decide not only whether a company should pursue an opportunity but also what strategies would further that pursuit.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">The Five Cs (Situational Analysis)</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">The Five Cs provide an overview of the environment for a product or decision.</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Company:</span> This encompasses all aspects of a company, including its products, culture, strategy, brand reputation, strengths, weaknesses, and infrastructure.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Competitors:</span> Competitors include direct competitors, potential competitors, and substitute products. For each of these, a discussion could encompass market share, tradeoffs, positioning, mission, and potential future decisions.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Customers:</span> This includes aspects such as demographics, purchase behavior, market size, distribution channels, and customer needs and wants.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Collaborators:</span> Collaborators include suppliers, distributors, and partnerships. A discussion here might include what makes particular collaborators valuable and how they enable success.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Climate:</span> Climate includes aspects such as regulations, technology changes, economic environment, and cultural trends. A hostile climate can kill a business decision, while a positive one can greatly facilitate success.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">This framework can guide discussions on whether a company should launch a product and what the company’s strategy should be.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Porter’s 5 Forces</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Porter’s 5 Forces is a framework for industry analysis. This industry analysis can be useful for understanding a company’s decision.</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Rivalry Among Existing Competitors:</span> More competitors generally leads to more heated competition, as does more direct competition. If many companies make the same product and they are not strongly differentiated, this will generally drive down prices for everyone. Many things can influence rivalry, such as market growth (growing markets enable competitors to expand without fighting with each other for market share) and high costs to exit the market (companies are reluctant to leave).</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Buyer Power:</span> If a company or industry has relatively few buyers (for example, only the government and big banks), or some buyers have a very disproportionate share of revenue, these buyers will wield considerable power. This power allows them to affect prices, feature sets, delivery timelines, and other aspects.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Supplier Power:</span> Like buyers, suppliers gain influence over a company if the company is heavily dependent on them. This commonly happens if a company has a component that it exclusively (or almost exclusively) purchases from a single source.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Threat of Substitutes:</span> Competition exists not just from direct competitors, but also from substitute products. For example, even if Amazon were the only seller of electronic books (and therefore there was no direct competition), the prices of e-books would still be influenced by “competition” from physical books.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Threat of New Entrants:</span> With few barriers to entry in an industry, companies are constantly vulnerable to competition. If they price their goods too high, another company will enter the market and capture market share. Barriers to entry can include things such as proprietary technology, massive economies of scale, strong brands, or anything that’s very difficult to do.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">Consider, for example, the PC market. Buyers have considerable power, as many sales come from just a few retailers. Suppliers also have considerable power since there are limited manufacturers of certain components and high switching costs in changing manufacturers. On the positive side, there is some differentiation between competitors and limited substitutes. The market has moderate barriers to entry (branding, etc.). There are worse markets to be in, but there are also many better markets.</p><p class="calibre_1">This framework could be useful in discussing whether or not a company should enter a specific market. What’s the industry like? If it’s hyper-competitive, we might choose to avoid it.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Make Your Own Framework</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">If you think a lot of these frameworks sound sort of the same, you’re not alone. They do overlap. Here’s a way to see the differences:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Customer Purchase Decision Making Process</span> helps us understand the buying process and gives us an “entry point” for boosting sales.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Marketing Mix (4 Ps)</span> describes the different aspects of a company’s marketing plan.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">SWOT Analysis</span> offers a framework for analyzing a strategic decision.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Five Cs (Situational Analysis)</span> gives an overview of the environment around a product or company.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Porter’s 5 Forces</span> describes what an industry as a whole looks like.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">Use these frameworks as a starting point to analyze a problem and to signal key aspects you might otherwise miss, such as the value of nurturing an ongoing customer relationship.</p><p class="calibre_1">In an actual interview, you should use the best “framework,” or structure, to solve the problem. If that’s one of these frameworks, great! But more often than not, you’ll need to create your own. You might slightly tweak one of these, you might blend two or three together, or you might come up with something totally fresh.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_103"></div>
