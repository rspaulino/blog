Even if you knew the “right” answer, it wouldn’t help you. In fact, it could distract you. This is one case where the correct answer isn’t necessarily the best one.</p><p class="calibre_1">Estimation questions are entirely about the process you take to solve them. It’s the journey, not the destination, so to speak. Interviewers will use these questions to evaluate your problem-solving skills as well as your quantitative skills.</p><p class="calibre_1">What’s the relevance to PMing, you might ask? Quite a bit, actually.</p><p class="calibre_1">Other than the obvious (an ideal PM is good at problem solving and good at math), being able to estimate things is actually a valuable skill. After all, when you need to figure out what you might be able to expect for the revenue from a given feature, estimations will come in handy.</p><p class="calibre_1">In life, as in the interview, you’ll be shooting for a number in the right ballpark. Precision is not expected.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_86"></div>
