The procedures for these interviews are mostly similar, but they have a few differences.</p><p class="calibre_1">Both product manager and associate product manager candidates start off with one or two phone screens. Successful candidates are then brought on for a full day of interviews.</p><p class="calibre_1">In the onsite interviews, PM candidates interview with people from multiple roles and levels. They should have at least three interviews with fellow PMs of the same level or higher, plus at least one person from a different team. One of your interviewers will also be the hiring manager.</p><p class="calibre_1">In APM interviews, candidates do not interview with the specific team. After an offer is made and accepted, you will be asked your team preferences. You will then be notified of your team one to two weeks before you start.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">How Decisions Get Made</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">After your interviews, each interviewer submits written feedback to the hiring manager, who then puts together a packet. If the team is feeling positive about the candidate, the packet is sent to the hiring committee and then to executives for final approval.</p><p class="calibre_1">For APM interviews, offer decisions are made by the APM steering committee, then reviewed and finalized by the executives.</p><p class="calibre_1">In either case, Yahoo looks for people who are passionate, high energy, and capable of getting stuff done and launching products.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Special Focuses</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Yahoo is looking for deeply technical PMs, so you should expect to prove that you have a solid technical foundation. You need to show you can communicate with engineers, but it’s unlikely you’d be asked to code.</p><p class="calibre_1">You should also expect product and analytical questions. Try to have a framework and a specific point of view.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_48"></div>
