<p id="filepos651482" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Preparation</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">Practice makes perfect—and you <span class="italic">should</span> practice these questions alone or with a friend. Additionally, it’s important to come in with ready-to-go answers for these questions.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Step 1: Select Products</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Walking into your interview, you should be prepared to talk in depth about the following:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">One online product.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29">One physical “offline” product. Interviewers love to try to “stump” candidates by asking them to assess a physical product.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29">One product you purchased recently.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29">Your “favorite” product or website.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_29">A product you think is well designed.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_29">The company or team’s product.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">Oftentimes, a company will ask a candidate “What’s the last product you purchased?” It doesn’t truly need to be the very last product, but it should be something fairly recent.</p><p class="calibre_1">Some of these products could be the same. For example, the online product you selected could be your favorite product. However, being prepared to discuss more products may prove valuable.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Step 2: Understand Key Metrics</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">For each product, think about and understand the product’s key metrics. These will likely include the following:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Users / Traffic:</span> How many users does the product have? How are they acquiring users?</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Conversion:</span> How effectively does the product convert a visitor to a user, a free user to a paid user, or a paid user to a more highly paying user?</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Referral Rates:</span> Do users refer other users? How often? Is the product viral?</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Engagement:</span> Are users actively engaging with the product (posting, comment, playing, etc.)? How often?</li><li value="5" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Retention:</span> How often do users come back? How many users come back after a certain amount of time? For some products, visiting once a month is good. For others, you’ll want a user to frequently visit.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Revenue:</span> How does the product make money? How much money does it make?</li><li value="7" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Costs:</span> Where does the product face costs? Does it require physical materials? What are its development costs? Does it face high support or sales costs?</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">It’s important to think through which of these are most crucial, which the product excels in, and which it struggles in. What would you do to change these metrics?</p><p class="calibre_1">See Also: <a href="index_split_104.html#filepos683948">Product Metrics</a></p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Step 3: Analyze Each Product</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Now that you understand what the metrics are for each product (as well as you can), analyze the product on the following aspects:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Users and Goals:</span> What are the primary types of users? What are their goals? How does the product help users accomplish these goals?</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Strengths:</span> For which metrics does the product excel? Does it have a lot of users? Does it have high engagement per user?</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Challenges / Focuses:</span> What is the main challenge the product faces? Is it struggling to get users to sign up? Is it struggling to convert free users to paid users?</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Why, Why, Why:</span> Why does the product excel (or struggle) in a particular way?</li><li value="5" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Priorities and Values:</span> What does the product or company care about? Apple, for instance, is obsessed with the user experience. An enterprise-software company, however, might prioritize security and reliability over aesthetics.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Competitors:</span> What are the product’s competitors? How does the product measure up to them? Think both narrowly and broadly about competitors. A stereo competes not only with other stereos, but also with people’s mobile phones.</li><li value="7" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Tradeoffs:</span> What are the tradeoffs a product has had to make in order to accomplish its goals or address user needs? How did it come to be that the product had these strengths or challenges?</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">In essence, you want to dissect the product from a business perspective, as well as from a user perspective. Keep asking yourself <span class="italic">why</span> and <span class="italic">how</span>. Why did the product do something in a particular way, and how could it be better?</p><p class="calibre_1">While you should assume the company probably had good reasons for its decisions, you shouldn’t automatically assume that they did everything right. Virtually every product can be improved.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_97"></div>
