<p id="filepos393062" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">“Tell Me About Yourself” (The Pitch)</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">Many interviewers will kick off the session with an open-ended “Tell me about yourself.” question. In fact, over the course of a full day of interviews, you can almost guarantee you’ll get this question. You should be prepared with a solid pitch about your background, accomplishments, and interests.</p><p class="calibre_1">This is not a time to just read off your resume or blab about your personal life. Rather, pick out a few of the key things you’d like your interviewer to know about you. This is an opportunity to connect your experience with the job you’re interviewing for.</p><p class="calibre_1">Consider this pitch:</p><p class="calibre_1">Interviewer: Tell me a bit about yourself.</p><p class="calibre_1">Candidate:</p><blockquote class="calibre_23"><span class="italic">Sure, I’d love to.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">I’m currently a PM with MapSign, where I have been for the last two years.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">I got into product management by accident, but found that I loved working with customers. A lot of people see technology as forcing complexity into their lives, but I don’t think it has to be that way. I like listening to customers, understanding exactly what their issues are, and figuring out how technology can simplify their lives.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">After I graduated from college, I joined a small startup called MealRight as a software engineer. We were doing okay, but it just didn’t look like we were getting that hockey stick growth that everyone talks about.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">I knew a bit about the restaurant industry from my family’s restaurant growing up, and I proposed pivoting to focus on giving restaurants more visibility into their suppliers. I talked with a bunch of restaurants to validate this problem, and successfully convinced the team to shift gears.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">I stepped in as product manager where I stayed for several years, eventually leading a team of four PMs.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">I’m currently a PM with MapSign, where I manage the personalization features.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">I recently launched a feature which allows users to create their own maps. This was actually created on a whim for a hackathon I participated in, but it turned out that users really loved this. It allowed them to tell a “story.” Whereas previously people used our product mostly privately, now people were sharing their maps with family and friends. This has resulted in about a 15% increase in paying users.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">I can go into more detail about my work at MapSign if you’d like.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">Outside of work, I do a bit of coding for fun, participating in hackathons like the one I just mentioned. I also run a blog focused on the New York City music scene. I manage a team of ten writers—mostly college students, who are happy to write for free. We get about 200,000 visits per month.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">I’m looking now for a role at an early-stage company where I’ll be able to take a single product from conception through to launch. I think my experience as a developer and as a PM who works cross-functionally will give me the background to work with, and even take on some of the responsibilities of, several other roles. That’s a lot of what interested me in this role; it’s at the perfect time for me to dive in, and it’s so closely related to the personalization work I’m doing right now.</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_19">In this pitch, the candidate has walked the interviewer through his background, while sprinkling the story with key accomplishments, connecting the different accomplishments together, and prompting the interviewer to ask more about the areas where he shined. He’s formed a cohesive story about what he’s good at and why he loves being a PM.</p><p class="calibre_1">Design your pitch by thinking about what you want the interviewer to know about your background, experiences, and interests. Where possible, connect elements of your pitch to what the company is looking for, whether that’s aspects of the PM role specifically or the company’s product.</p><p class="calibre_1">Additionally, keep in mind these dos and don’ts.</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Do</span> be mindful of how long you speak. Your interviewer will be judging you in part on your communication skills, and no one likes a rambler. A good rule of thumb is to speak one to two times as long as your interviewer did, if she introduced herself. Otherwise, about two minutes is a good guide.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Do</span> highlight the most interesting or relevant parts of your jobs. This is your opportunity to sell yourself.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Don’t</span> just list off your accomplishments. That can come off as too boastful, and your interviewer might even get lost in all the details. Your pitch should be a cohesive story about how you got from then to now. It should connect the different elements of your life and offer context for why you’re a good fit for this role.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Don’t</span> get overly technical. It’s great if you have some very technical experience, but your interviewer wants to hear in more straightforward language why that work was important. After all, as a PM, you need to communicate with both technical and non-technical people.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Do</span> discuss your “extracurricular” activities, where relevant. For example, if you’re applying to a fitness-related startup and you’ve started a marathon training group, that’s a good thing to mention. It shows a passion for the space, and possibly even expertise in it. Even when the extracurriculars are not directly applicable, they can often show initiative and leadership.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Do</span> practice. It’s almost a guarantee you’ll be asked for your “pitch,” so it’s silly to be unprepared. Grab a friend and let them hear your pitch. How does it sound to them? You might even want to record your pitch for yourself so you can hear how it sounds.</li><li value="7" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Don’t</span> speak too abstractly. Instead of just saying you did customer research and wrote specs, talk about an example of something important you learned and how you changed the product design based on that.</li><li value="8" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Don’t</span> be boring and just rattle off a bunch of facts about yourself. Weave your pitch into a mini-story.</li><li value="9" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Do</span> be passionate and proud of your past work.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">You should look forward to this question. This is your opportunity to sell your interviewer on why you’re the perfect candidate, and you’ll be perfectly prepared to do so.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_72"></div>
