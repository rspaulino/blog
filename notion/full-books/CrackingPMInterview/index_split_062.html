They merely restate the candidate’s resume in paragraph form. This might show some basic writing skills, but it doesn’t add (or subtract) much.</p><p class="calibre_1">A good PM cover letter has the following attributes:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Short:</span> Keep your cover letters to around 200 - 250 words. Lengthy cover letters are less likely to be read and likely contain a lot of unnecessary detail. Additionally, being too verbose will reflect poorly on you.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Shows Passion:</span> An ideal PM is passionate about technology and about the industry. This passion should be reflected in the cover letter. Tell the reader why this job excites you.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Demonstrates Skills:</span> Look through the desired skillset of a PM – in general and for this position – and reflect on how your background does or doesn’t match it. Pay particular attention to any skills you possess but which might not easily be shown in your resume; use your cover letter to demonstrate these.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Matches the Company Culture:</span> Does the company prize “business people,” or does it like to show a bit more flair? Reflect this in your cover letter. A fun, quirky company could merit a fun, quirky cover letter – particularly if your resume otherwise reads like a boring business person’s.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Well Written:</span> Your cover letter is a writing sample and it should be handled as such. This means, of course, no spelling or grammar errors. It should also be succinct rather than full of flowery, descriptive prose. Keep an eye on your sentences and be sure they don’t get too long or complex. Vary between longer sentences and shorter sentences.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">Ultimately, your cover letter is a way to connect your background with the “perfect” PM fit. Use it to do that.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_62"></div>
