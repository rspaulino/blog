We have provided solutions for these problems, but you should think of these solutions as being just one possible solution. There are often many correct solutions. Still, reading the solutions—after you’ve solved the problem yourself, of course—can be a useful way to explore alternative approaches or to remind you of details you might have missed.</p><p class="calibre_1">Many of these questions are ambiguous, and that’s okay! Part of your goal as a candidate is to resolve ambiguities prior to solving the question.</p><p class="calibre_1">To practice these questions, make appropriate assumptions to resolve any ambiguity. In the solutions, we might make different assumptions. That’s okay; our solutions are not <span class="italic">the</span> answer, but rather just one reasonable approach.</p><p class="calibre_1">Where possible, we’ve obtained the “correct” answer from census or other data. We’ve provided this just for fun, but don’t worry too much if your answer (or our answer) is far off. It is useful to understand why your answer was far off—was it a logical error or an unreasonable assumption?—but the actual accuracy doesn’t matter.</p><p class="calibre_1">The first three questions are tackled with a more detailed step-by-step approach so that you can get the hang of things.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Question 1: How much does the US spend on dog food each year?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">We’ll walk through this question step-by-step.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Step 1: Clarify the Question</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">What might be ambiguous in this question?

Does this sound right to you?</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">If there are major issues with this answer, where might they have come from? Here are a few ideas:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">We assumed / calculated that 30% of households have children. This probably isn’t wildly off (it’s not going to be 5% or 80%), but I could see the actual answer being anywhere from 20% to 60%.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29">We assumed that 30% of households with kids have dogs. This was a pretty arbitrary guess, and therefore subject to issues.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29">We assumed that 10% of households without kids have dogs. Again, this was a pretty arbitrary guess.

We were off by a factor of about three, which isn’t terrible. It’s still the right general ballpark. Where did we go wrong though? The Humane Society provides some useful stats:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">39% of households own at least one dog.

We also slightly underestimated the number of families with multiple dogs. We calculated 1.2 dogs per dog owner, when there are actually 1.69 dogs.</p><p class="calibre_1">Additionally, our food costs were off by a factor of 2.

Remember: it’s the approach that matters, not the final answer.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Step 1: Clarify the Question</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">The main thing that’s ambiguous is who exactly we’re counting as police officers. College campuses, for example, often have their own police officers. There’s also some ambiguity over whether or not we’re considering police officers who work “desk jobs.”</p><p class="calibre_1">Let’s assume that we’re referring to all police officers, including university police officers, whether they work a desk job or patrol.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Step 2: Catalog What You Know (or Wish You Knew)</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">We know:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">There are 300 million people in the US.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29">More densely populated areas have more police officers.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29">There must be police officers working all day and night.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29">Police officers who patrol generally do so in pairs.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">We might like to know the following:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">How much crime is there annually per capita?</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29">How many police officers work a desk job, relative to those on the street?</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29">How many police officers do you need per person?</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">The last of these, in particular, would be very nice. One way to get a <span class="italic">ballpark</span> estimate for the number of police officers needed is to use a specific example (a small town or school, for example) that we know of and work from there. Another way might be to ask what percent of people employed could be police officers. For example, it’s unlikely that 1% of the US holds a job as a police officer.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Step 3: Make an Equation</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">One possible equation is something like this:</p><blockquote class="calibre_23"><span class="calibre6"><tt class="calibre10">([population of the US] / [# of people per patrolling police officer]) * (# of total police officers per patrolling officers)</tt></span></blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_31"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Step 4: Think About Edge Cases and Sources</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">We’ve already covered the other sources for police officers (campuses, etc.), and ruled them out. We will have to think about how higher-crime vs. lower-crime areas will affect the police officer count.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Step 5: Break It Down</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">We know the population of the US. The tricky parts will be thinking about how many people there are per patrolling police officer and what the ratio of total police officers to patrolling officers is. We’ll cover those in the next section though. In this problem, there’s little to break down in the main equation.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Step 6: Review &amp; State Your Assumptions</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">How can we get the number of people per patrolling police officer? A few ways, depending on what knowledge or assumptions you might have:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">I read an article about a particular school which had about 2000 students and 4 police officers. Schools, however, need a minimum staff to guard doors. An even larger school might have fewer police officers per person.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29">A small town would need a minimum of 6 police officers (3 shifts per day with 2 officers per shift).</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29">Most police officers are male.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29">At most, I could imagine that 1 out of every 200 men are police officers. This would mean about 1 out of every 400 people.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_29">There are probably more teachers than police officers. There must be at least 1 teacher for every school-aged child (between ages 6 and 18). Roughly 1/8th of the US population is between those ages, so that means that about 1 out of every 240 people is a teacher teaching kids between ages 6 and 18.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">These assumptions offer a bunch of different numbers, but they’re in the same general ballpark. We can probably take a guess at a number from there. Let’s go with 1 patrolling police officer per 500 people.</p><p class="calibre_1">Now, how can we guess the number of police officers per patrolling officer? Let’s start with this: do you think that there’s more desk work or patrolling work? My guess is that there’s lots of paperwork for any incident. I’m going to take a guess at there being at least one person working a desk job for every officer out on the streets.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Step 7: Do the Math</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">We just have to plug our assumptions into the equation:</p><blockquote class="calibre_23"><span class="calibre6"><tt class="calibre10">([population of the US] / [# of people per patrolling police officer]) * (# of total police officers per patrolling officers)</tt></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre6"><tt class="calibre10">= (300 million people / 500 people per patrolling)</tt></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre6"><tt class="calibre10">  * (2 officers per patrolling officer)</tt></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre6"><tt class="calibre10">= 1.2 million police officers</tt></span></blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_31"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Step 8: Sanity Check</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">How can we sanity check this? 1.2 million police officers means:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">About 1 out of every 300 people is a police officer.

The largest public schools might have as many as 1000 kids per grade, but there are also a lot of schools that are smaller (particularly in more rural areas). I suspect the average is more like 250 kids per grade, or 1000 kids per school.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Private Schools:</span> Private schools are more likely to have merged middle and high schools, so it’s probably more like 5 grades per school. They won’t (can’t) vary as much in size. Private schools are more like 100 - 150 on the large side and 50 on the small side.

A problem like this is highly subject to your assumptions. If you assumed 500 kids per public school class, your answer would be much further from the actual number, even if you’d taken an identical approach.

We could then use the following equation:</p><blockquote class="calibre_23"><span class="calibre6"><tt class="calibre10">([volume of hot tub] / [volume of straw]) * [time to empty and fill straw]</tt></span></blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_31">This doesn’t take evaporation of water into account. It also doesn’t take into account that water at the bottom of the tub is harder to reach and therefore might take longer.

What we really want to know is the average depth of a hot tub. If I picture a 6-foot person standing in a hot tub, the water comes a bit above their knees but well below their waist. That’s probably about 2.5 feet deep from the water surface to the deepest point. When they sit though, it comes up about halfway to their chest. That is about 1.5 feet from the water surface to the seats. The floor is about half-covered with seats, so I think that gives us an average depth of around 2 feet.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Length of Side:</span> A hot tub can (cozily) fit about 3 people, each of whom are 2 feet wide. So a hot tub is probably about 6 feet wide.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">The volume of a hot tub is therefore about 72 cubic feet (6 ft x 6 ft x 2 ft), or about 2 cubic meters.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="bold">Volume of a Straw:</span> A drinking straw is probably about 20 cm long. I’d guess the width is about 0.5 cm long, which is a .25 cm radius. Let’s round π (pi) down to 3, and convert again to metric, so we get a volume of 20 * (3 * .25<sup class="calibre11"><small class="calibre12">2</small></sup>), or about 4 cubic cm.</p><p class="calibre_1">Dividing 2 cubic meters (2,000,000 cubic cm) by 4 cubic cm gives us 500,000. So it takes about 500,000 trips with the straw to empty the hot tub.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="bold">Filling and Emptying a Straw:</span> Just by “miming” this, it feels like this takes about 4 seconds.</p><p class="calibre_1">We now have an answer: 500,000 straw trips * 4 seconds = 2,000,000 seconds.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="bold">Conversion to days:</span> We can convert that to days if you’d like. 60 seconds / minute * 60 minutes / hour gives us 3600 seconds per hour. Multiply that by 24 hours (multiply by 10 to get 36000, then double to get 70000, then increase by about 25% to get about 90,000) and we get around 90,000 seconds in day. Dividing 2,000,000 by 90,000 will give us a little over 20 days. It’s probably about 22 days.</p><p class="calibre_1">Our final answer is 22 days.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Question 6: How many pairs of eyeglasses are sold every year in the US?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">I’ll assume that we’re referring to eyeglasses only, not sunglasses.</p><p class="calibre_1">There are about 300 million people in the US. Let’s assume an 80-year lifespan on average. Let’s also assume that people get new frames every three years on average. I now just need to calculate the number of people with eyeglasses in the US and divide that by three.</p><p class="calibre_1">We’ll need to break the population down by age since vision problems get worse with age. We’ll also want to divide by gender, since (from my experience) a greater percent of men with poor vision wear glasses than women. Women are more likely to wear contact lenses.</p><p class="calibre_1">There are also both nearsighted and farsighted individuals. Let’s separate by this too.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="bold">Nearsighted:</span> In my experience, very few young children are nearsighted. Moreover, those who are not nearsighted by age 20 or so tend to have stable vision for a long time.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><table valign="top" class="calibre7"><tr valign="top" class="calibre8"><td valign="top" class="calibre_40"><p class="calibre_31"><span class="bold">Age</span></p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre_40"><p class="calibre_3"><span class="bold">% of people of this age who are nearsighted</span></p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre_40"><p class="calibre_3"><span class="bold">% of nearsighted men who wear glasses</span></p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre_40"><p class="calibre_3"><span class="bold">% of nearsighted women who wear glasses</span></p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre_40"><p class="calibre_3"><span class="bold">% of people this age with nearsighted glasses</span></p></td></tr><tr valign="top" class="calibre8"><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_31">&lt; age 10</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_31">0%</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_31">0%</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_31">0%</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_31">= 0%</p></td></tr><tr valign="top" class="calibre8"><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_31">10 - 40</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_31">50%</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_31">50%</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_31">20%</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_31">= 17.5%</p></td></tr><tr valign="top" class="calibre8"><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_31">40 - 80</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_31">80%</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_31">80%</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_31">80%</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_31">= 64%</p></td></tr></table><p class="calibre_1">Weighting the column on the right by the proportion at each age, we get that about 38% of people are nearsighted with glasses.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="bold">Farsighted:</span> Very few people become farsighted until well into adulthood.

That’s about 200 million people wearing glasses. (Note that this is actually double counting some people—some people will wear both nearsighted glasses and farsighted glasses—but that’s okay for our purposes.)</p><p class="calibre_1">If each person buys one pair of glasses every three years, then there are about 67 million pairs of glasses purchased each year.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Question 7: How much does a school bus weigh?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Let’s assume we’re talking about a school bus with a full tank of gas but no children on it. We’ll also assume we’re talking about a larger school bus, as opposed to a “short” bus.</p><p class="calibre_1">How big is a school bus? A typical school bus has, as I recall, about 15 rows of seats. I think each seat is about 3 feet away from each other, so that’s 45 feet, plus some extra room for the driver. Let’s figure about 50 feet.</p><p class="calibre_1">A bus is a little wider than a car, but can’t be much wider or it wouldn’t fit on the road. That makes it about six feet wide.</p><p class="calibre_1">Let’s break down the different components of a bus and calculate the weight of each. We have seats, a gas tank, tires, windows, an engine, and the frame.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="bold">Seats:</span> There are 15 rows of seats, with 2 seats on each side, so that’s 30 seats total. The seats are made from fairly sturdy metals, I believe, so they’re not going to be super light. I’d guess they would be about 50 lbs. each. The seats therefore will be about 1500 lbs. total.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="bold">Gas Tank:</span> I think my car holds about 20 gallons of gas, but a bus would probably have a much larger tank. Let’s say it’s three times larger. That’s a 60 gallon tank. I think a gallon of water is around 10 lbs., so let’s assume gas is the same weight. So that’s 600 lbs. of gas.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="bold">Tires:</span> A larger bus probably has three rows of tires, with two on each side, so that’s 6 tires. I’ve lifted a car tire before and remember it wasn’t too heavy. Let’s say a car tire is about 20 lbs. A bus tire is larger though, so maybe 30 lbs. With 6 tires, that gives us about 180 lbs.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="bold">Bus Windows:</span> Each window is about 2 ft. tall, I think. If we treat the left and right sides as having a continuous window (which is mostly correct), this is about 90 sq. ft. (45 ft. x 2 ft.) of window on each side. If we add in the windows at the front of the bus (about 6 ft. x 4 ft.) and the back of the bus (about 2 ft. x 6 ft.), this gets us an additional 36 ft. of windows. All in all, we’re talking about 216 sq. ft. of windows.</p><p class="calibre_1">How much does a window weigh though? Having lifted glass table tops before, I’ve found that a 3 ft. x 3 ft. piece of glass is fairly easily lifted, but still heavy. I’d guess that that’s about 40 lbs. This gives us an estimate of about 4 lbs. per sq. ft.</p><p class="calibre_1">So 216 sq. ft. of windows at 4 lbs. per sq. ft. would be about 850 lbs.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="bold">Engine:</span> This is tricky to guess since I don’t have much experience with engines. I’d guess though that you’d need two or three strong people to lift a car engine. If each person can lift 100 lbs., that gives us a guess of about 300 lbs. Again, a bus will have a substantially larger engine, so let’s say about 500 lbs. for a bus engine.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="bold">Bus Frame:</span> This is probably the hardest part as I don’t really know how much metal weighs. We have a metal frame below, which is about 45 ft. long by 6 ft. wide. This needs to be fairly thick. I would guess that 1 sq. ft. of the frame is about 30 lbs., so that’s about 8000 lbs. for the bottom.</p><p class="calibre_1">The top doesn’t need to be quite so thick, so let’s say about 4000 lbs.</p><p class="calibre_1">Each side of the bus is about 6 ft. tall and 45 ft. long. If we go with an estimate of 15 lbs. per sq. ft., that’s about 4000 lbs. per side, or 8000 lbs. across the two sides.</p><p class="calibre_1">The front and back of the bus is 6 ft. tall and 6 ft. wide. I’d guess we need fairly sturdy metal there, so let’s again assume 30 lbs. per square foot. That’s about 1000 lbs. for the front and the back, or 2000 lbs. together.</p><p class="calibre_1">Our entire frame is then about 22,000 lbs.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="bold">Total:</span> We have a 22,000 lbs. frame, 500 lbs. for the engine, 850 lbs. of windows, 180 lbs. of tires, 600 lbs. of gas, and 1500 lbs. of seats. In total, that’s 25,630 lbs. I think a car is about 3000 lbs., so 25,000 lbs. for a school bus seems like it’s in the right ballpark.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Actual Answer:</span></span> Depending on the size, a school bus can be anywhere from 10,000 lbs. to 36,000 lbs. A typical 62-passenger bus (about what we assumed here) is around 20,000 lbs., without gas.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Question 8: How many basketballs are purchased every year in the US?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Basketballs are purchased by schools, (non-school) teams, and families. Let’s calculate how many basketballs are owned by each group and then estimate a replacement rate.</p><p class="calibre_1">I’ll assume that basketballs purchased by adults for their own use (not for their kids) is negligible.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="bold">Families:</span> There are about 45 million kids aged 6 - 18 in the US. Let’s assume that families without kids are unlikely to own basketballs, and each family has an average of 2 kids. This means that there are about 20 million households with kids.</p><p class="calibre_1">I’d guess that one fourth of households with kids have a basketball, and they buy one basketball per year on average. This is about 5 million basketballs per year.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="bold">Schools:</span> My high school had about 50 basketballs for a 500-person school. With constant usage, each ball probably didn’t last more than three months. There are nine months in the school year, so this means we went through about 150 basketballs per year for 500 kids.</p><p class="calibre_1">However, my school was better funded than most schools in the US. A ratio of 50 basketballs per 500 high schoolers might be more realistic.</p><p class="calibre_1">We should actually adjust our number downwards even more since elementary schools won’t use as many basketballs. Let’s figure then about 25 basketballs for every 500 kids, or 1 basketball for every 20 kids.</p><p class="calibre_1">With 45 million kids, this means about 2 million basketballs purchased by schools every year.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="bold">Teams:</span> There are a variety of teams in the US: kids teams, professional teams, adult intramural teams, college teams, and school teams. We’ve already included school purchases, so we don’t need to recount those.</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">Kids teams: If we assume that 1% of kids play on a basketball team and a basketball team has about 10 kids per team, then there are about 45,000 kids’ basketball teams in the US. If each team buys 10 basketballs per year (one per player), then this is about 450,000 basketballs.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29">Professional teams: This should be negligible.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29">Adult intramural teams: This should be negligible.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29">College teams: There are about 15 million college-age people in the US. Of those, maybe 5% play a college sport, and for 5% of those people that sport is basketball. Thus there are about 37,500 college basketball players in the US. If we again assume a purchase of one basketball per player per year, this is 37,500 basketballs.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">This gives us about 500,000 basketballs purchased for teams.</p><p class="calibre_1">We have accounted for 5 million home purchases, 2 million school purchases, and 500,000 team purchases. This gives us a total of about 7.5 million basketballs purchased every year.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Question 9: How much money do people spend on haircuts every year in the US?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Observe first that the price of a haircut can vary dramatically. A haircut, plus dyeing of hair (common for women), can be $200 or more at a nice salon. On the other hand, a man’s haircut at a cheaper barber might be as low as $10. We’ll need to consider this in our answer.</p><p class="calibre_1">We can assume that men get their hair cut 12 times per year (once per month) and women get their hair cut about 5 times per year.</p><p class="calibre_1">I’d guess that about two-thirds of people (adults and children) get their hair cut professionally, with the remainder getting their hair cut at home or through a friend. This gives us about 100 million men and 100 million women using professional hair cutters.</p><p class="calibre_1">Therefore, we have about 1.2 billion male haircuts and 500 million female haircuts per year.</p><p class="calibre_1">I rarely see men in nice salons, so we can assume that virtually all of the 1.2 billion male haircuts take place at a cheaper haircutting place. If the average price of a haircut there is $20, then we have about $24 billion spent by men on haircuts.</p><p class="calibre_1">Many more women go to nicer salons for their haircut. Let’s suppose that 20% of women go to nice salons for their haircut and that those haircuts cost an average of $100 each. This means that the average woman’s haircut costs $36. Women therefore spend about $18 billion on haircuts every year.</p><p class="calibre_1">Combined, that’s about $40 billion on haircuts each year. However, I think that was overestimating a bit. I suspect about 25% of the US doesn’t need haircuts because they’re bald, small children, and so on. The number is probably closer to $25 million.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Question 10: How much money does Facebook make in ads every year?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">I remember seeing reports not too long ago that Facebook has about one billion users. However, many of those accounts might not be active. Let’s assume that 50% of those accounts are actually active and the active users log into Facebook about once per day on average.</p><p class="calibre_1">This means that Facebook has about 500 million visits per day. The average visit is probably about 10 minutes and has about 10 pageviews. This gives us a figure of 5 billion pageviews per day.</p><p class="calibre_1">If each page has four ads on it, then Facebook shows about 20 billion ads every day.</p><p class="calibre_1">As I recall, click-through rates for search ads on Google are usually about 2%, but I also know that search ads get substantially more clicks than display ads. If we assume a 10x difference between search ads and display ads, then we have a click-through rate of about 0.2%.</p><p class="calibre_1">This gives us a total of about 40 million clicks per day.</p><p class="calibre_1">How much revenue does each click generate?</p><p class="calibre_1">I know Google search ads rarely generate less than 5 cents per click but they can generate as much as $10 per click. This is a huge range, of course. From my experiments with ads, I found that I was paying about 25 cents per click. This was probably for a slightly cheaper-than-average market segment though. Let’s figure about 50 cents per click on average. I’m assuming here that Facebook ads are equivalent to Google ads, which could possibly be an unfair assumption. Let’s work with that for now though.</p><p class="calibre_1">40 million clicks per day at 50 cents per click is about $20 million per day. This means about $7 billion dollars in revenue.</p><p class="calibre_1">This sounds about right if we look at salary costs. If Facebook has about 5000 employees, each of whom probably earns about $100k in salary on average, then this is $500 million in salary costs. It seems reasonable to think that Facebook’s revenue is 10 - 20x its salary costs.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Actual Answer:</span></span> Facebook’s annual revenue was $5.1 billion in 2012, about $4.3 billion of which was from ads.</p><p id="filepos601125" class="calibre_1"><a href="#filepos543849">1</a> “Pets by the Numbers.” Human Society. 27 September, 2013.</p><p id="filepos601262" class="calibre_1"><a href="#filepos545191">2</a> How much does owning a pet cost in a year?” Kay, Liz F. 12 February 2012.
