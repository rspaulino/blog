<p id="filepos246900" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Google</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">A quick search online will reveal a multitude of rumors about Google’s interview process and culture. Some will recount “horror” stories about Google interviewers trying to intimidate the candidate, and some will discuss the ridiculous questions that someone’s friend’s cousin’s college roommate allegedly was asked.</p><p class="calibre_1">The reality is so much tamer than that.</p><p class="calibre_1">Google’s interview process is much like every other company’s. It begins with two phone interviews that may cover technical, cultural fit, strategic, analytical, and product design questions (though perhaps not all of these).</p><p class="calibre_1">If you pass those interviews, you will be brought onsite for a full day of interviews. You may have an interview over lunch. If so, this interviewer generally doesn’t submit feedback for you. She’s just there to sit with you and field questions.</p><p class="calibre_1">Your other interviewers will be assigned specific roles. Some will evaluate your technical skills, others your product skills, and still others your analytical skills.</p><p class="calibre_1">Each interviewer will be evaluating you separately. Google is pretty strict about interviewers not sharing feedback on you with other interviewers until everyone has submitted their feedback. This means you don’t need to worry about poor performance in your early interviews biasing your later interviewers. It also means getting “easy” or “hard” questions later on in the interview means nothing about your performance.</p><p class="calibre_1">After the interview, associate product managers (APMs) will be given an essay to write. The essay often focuses on an area of business strategy. Be concise and to the point; beautiful, descriptive prose is not good business writing. And, of course, be sure to check for any spelling or grammatical errors.</p><p class="calibre_1">PM candidates will be interviewing for a particular team, but many of the interviewers will not be from that team. APM candidates do not interview for a specific team since it’s a rotational program.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">How Decisions Get Made</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Interviewers do not decide who gets an offer. Rather, each interviewer writes up feedback, which goes to a hiring committee that makes the decision.</p><p class="calibre_1">You will be evaluated on a scale of 1.0 to 4.0 by each interviewer. This number alone doesn’t mean much though, as the hiring committee will take into account whether your interviewer was a “harsh grader.”</p><p class="calibre_1">Generally, you will need at least a 3.0 average interview score, plus one strong supporter. Thus, even if all of your interviewers recommend hiring you, you still might get rejected if none thought you were outstanding.</p><p class="calibre_1">The hiring committee is a mix of peers (other PMs), managers, and recruiters. Your interviewers will typically not be on the hiring committee. If this does happen, it’s purely by coincidence.</p><p class="calibre_1">The hiring committee makes a hire / no-hire recommendation (which is rarely overturned in later stages). If you get a hire recommendation, your packet is passed to a compensation committee and then to an executive committee to finalize your offer.</p><p class="calibre_1">The number of stages in the Google hiring process is one reason decisions can take several weeks.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Special Focuses</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Google is not as into behavioral questions as other companies are. In fact, many Google interviewers won’t have thoroughly read your resume beforehand; they prefer to test your skills more directly in the interview.</p><p class="calibre_1">Try to mix a few key points into each interview (where appropriate) since interviewers might not probe as deeply into your background. That awesome side project you did, when combined with strong performance on an analytical question, could be what you need to get a “strong hire” recommendation.</p><p class="calibre_1">Additionally, remember the hiring committee does not speak with your interviewers directly. They must make their decision entirely from the interviewers’ writeups. If there’s some aspect of your background that you want to be sure the hiring committee knows, mix that into multiple interviews. This will greatly improve the odds that the committee knows about it.</p><p class="calibre_1">Google loves questions about its own products: Which ones do you love? Which ones would you do differently? Be prepared to talk in detail about some Google products.</p><p class="calibre_1">Google also asks a lot of estimation questions and technical questions. Be sure to brush up on both your quantitative skills and your technical skills. Don’t be surprised if you’re asked to write a bit of code on the whiteboard.</p><p class="calibre_1">Estimation questions will often involve some aspects of Google products, and one of the big areas there is advertising. Pay special attention to the questions related to advertising in the case study chapter.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Associate Product Managers</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Candidates with minimal experience (less than two years) generally interview for an associate product manager role. This is a rotational program, so team fit is obviously less important. The interview process is basically the same as for the product manager role.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_43"></div>
