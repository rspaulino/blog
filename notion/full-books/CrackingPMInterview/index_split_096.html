<p id="filepos641536" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Type 3: Favorite Product</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">It’s very likely that at least one of your interviewers will ask you what your favorite product is and why (see our preparation tips below).</p><p class="calibre_1">These problems are similar to “improve a product,” but approached in reverse. Rather than speaking about what’s broken about a product, you discuss why you love this product.</p><p class="calibre_1">Generally, people will speak about a product they personally use. However, you could pick something you don’t use but love anyway. For example, a parent could think a child’s toy is brilliantly done and thus their “favorite” product, even though it’s not one that he or she personally uses.</p><p class="calibre_1">Some of your favorite products might not be good candidates for this question; beware of discussing them if you just can’t think of much that’s interesting to say about them.</p><p class="calibre_1">Similarly, you shouldn’t pick a product solely because it’s an interesting one to discuss. You want something that you, personally, connect with. You want your passion for this product to come out. Don’t pick something because it’s the “right” product if it’s not the right one for you.</p><p class="calibre_1">As always, you want to structure your answer to these questions. This question doesn’t necessarily require you to explicitly state your structure (although you could, if it sounded natural), but you should still keep your response organized. Strong communication skills are always important.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Step 1: What problems does the product solve for the user?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">You, or at least someone close to you, are probably the user here. You need to think about not just what the product is, but also what the user’s goals are.</p><p class="calibre_1">For example, take a product that analyzes your personal finances, like Mint.com. That’s what the product does, but it’s not a goal. The goal is likely to help you save money by understanding how you’re spending it. Did you really want to spend $1,000 on food last month?</p><p class="calibre_1">You can discuss more than one goal, but don’t go overboard. If you’re listing more than one or two goals, your discussion will lose focus—and you might actually be discussing features, not goals.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Step 2: How does the product accomplish these goals? What makes it “neat”? What makes users fall in love with the product?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Now you should discuss how exactly the product accomplishes these goals. There is something about the product that makes it uniquely powerful at doing this.</p><p class="calibre_1">For example, it might have a wealth of user data that allows it to perform more powerful analytics. Or maybe it just has an excellent interface, where every button seems to be in just the right place.</p><p class="calibre_1">In addition to being great at accomplishing these goals, there might be other things about the business that you think are particularly impressive. They might have a clever revenue model that’s a win-win for users, or they might have a way of reducing their costs substantially by relying on crowdsourcing. It’s okay to talk about these details as well.</p><p class="calibre_1">For many products, there is also an emotional connection to the product. Some products are truly loved by consumers; they are the things people rave about. Why?</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Step 3: How does it compare to the alternatives?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Every product has its alternatives, even ones that are seemingly first to market. Think both narrowly and broadly about what the “competition” is for this product. The direct competition might be other websites that do the exact same thing, and the indirect competition might be physical products that achieve your goal.</p><p class="calibre_1">In other words, there is a reason why you’re not using the alternatives. What is that reason?</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Step 4: How would you improve it?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">You don’t necessarily have to go into this immediately, but it’s a natural follow-up question the interviewer might ask. You should approach this the same way you would with the prior type of question.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Example: What’s your favorite website?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Here’s one answer I personally might give:</p><blockquote class="calibre_23"><span class="italic">“I’m a big fan of Quora, which is a question-and-answer website where users can pose questions and have them answered—often by experts in the subject. For example, someone might ask, ‘What’s the best way to replace a flat tire?’ or ‘Should start-ups wait to raise venture capital?’, or even ‘What is it like to live on a farm?’ It’s everything from solve-my-problem questions to what’s-your-opinion-on questions to tell-me-your-experience questions.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">What I love about Quora is how effective it is for solving specific problems. There are experts in virtually every industry offering their expertise and giving extremely thorough, well-thought-out answers.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">It’s helped me on a bunch of occasions. For example, when I was working on a translated version of some content, I needed to know how a Japanese translation would compare in number of pages to an English version. I got several great answers, approaching it in different ways. These people all really knew what they were talking about.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">On another occasion, I just wanted to know where the best coffee shop that would be good for studying near my home was. A lot of local people on the site and I found my now-favorite cafe this way.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">But even beyond solving specific problems, I find I just love being on the site. It’s essentially a community built on learning and exploring. You get to know the people on the site and value their responses, because you can trust them. I’ve never been the type of person to make “friends” through Quora. And yet, on Quora, I really do feel like I know the people. It’s a real community.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">I think it’s one of very few sites which have been able to bridge that gap between learning and fun. It’s engaging. Because it’s question-and-answer style, I find myself stumbling across a topic I’d never been interested in but wondering, “Yes, why is that?”</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">In many ways, it’s replaced Google for me as a place to get questions answered. If you think about it, searching online to solve questions has several issues:</span></blockquote><div class="calibre_47"> </div><ul class="calibre_48"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="italic">First, you search by keywords, even when you’re trying to answer a question. Your hope is you’ll find a page that offers a broad enough overview that you can answer your question. It’s not truly solution-oriented, so it’s often inefficient.</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre_49"><span class="italic">Second, trust. You might not trust the webpage author’s credentials. And even if you do, authors are wrong even about their areas of expertise. Quora allows users to give feedback on answers via comments (as well as through upvoting / downvoting), which is a great way to validate an answer’s accuracy. Google’s version of reputation is through PageRank, which is pretty imperfect.</span></li><li value="3" class="calibre_49"><span class="italic">Third, a lot of information is just hard to access through normal webpages and blogs. Websites have an inherent bias towards authors with the capability and desire to create a webpage. It’s easy to find technical support, but what about tips on how to act out a specific part from a play? Not as easy.</span></li></ul><blockquote class="calibre_6"><span class="italic">Of course, I still search for answers online, but I find myself using Quora more and more both to solve my problems and as a place to browse and learn new things.”</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_19">I’ve critiqued Quora here, but I’ve also done a few more things.</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">I’ve implicitly demonstrated a love for learning.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29">I’ve discussed why Quora grabs me: it’s question-based and it’s a community. This speaks to the emotional attachment some people have to a product.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29">I’ve discussed some less obvious flaws of online searching.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">This isn’t necessarily the answer for you, of course. Think about a website or product that speaks to you.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_96"></div>
