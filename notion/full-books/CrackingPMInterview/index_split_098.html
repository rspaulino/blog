<p id="filepos657644" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Tips and Tricks</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">Ultimately, these design questions are getting at how well you can show user empathy. Can you get inside the user’s head and think about what that type of user would want? Or will you just design the product you will want? Focusing on the user is key.</p><p class="calibre_1">In addition though, the following tips and tricks will help you:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Have an Opinion:</span> Develop a point of view and act like you’re the owner of the product. Interviewers want PMs who have opinions.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">“Wow” the Interviewer:</span> Try to come up with at least one “wow” idea. When you find it, point it out. Did you think of a major market the product could enter easily? Did you come up with a killer feature that would make people use the product twice as much? Don’t let it get hidden among the quick fixes.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Use the whiteboard:</span> Don’t feel you need to stay glued to your seat during such a question. In fact, it’s great to get up and use the whiteboard; that’s what it’s there for. Using the whiteboard may help you communicate your design more clearly to your interviewer.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Don’t overbuild:</span> Some people go overboard with wacky designs to solve a simple problem. You’ll want to be realistic about what can and can’t be built, and what the tradeoffs are.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Don’t complain that you need more research:</span> Yes, yes, we understand that, in an ideal world, you’d love to study a variety of things and gather a bunch of data. You can’t do that in the interview though—or in the real world. You’ll have to make do with what you can. It’s fine to briefly discuss what research you would like to gather to better inform your decision. If your interviewer seems interested in this discussion, then go for it. Otherwise, don’t dwell on it. Use your best judgement to inform your decision, just as you would in the real world.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Think about the business, too:</span> The customer’s goals are incredibly important, but so are the goals of the business. If you’re critiquing a real product, think about the business goals. For example, if you’re discussing what you would improve about a social media product, consider what the business’ primary concerns are. Is it increasing revenue? User sign ups? User engagement? These goals may guide how you want to improve the product.</li><li value="7" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Be open about the tradeoffs:</span> Some candidates try to pass off their product as <span class="italic">the</span> best idea, as though their interviewer won’t catch potential issues. Not so. Your interviewer will know the issues your idea has. If she doesn’t, then you’ll actually impress her by pointing out issues that she wasn’t aware of.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">When in doubt, act like you would imagine a good PM to act. A good PM will be realistic about the limitations. A good PM would gather research, but would also be able to move forward without it. A good PM will think about the business aspects. A good PM will be open about the potential issues with her designs.</p><p class="calibre_1">Act like a good PM.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_98"></div>
