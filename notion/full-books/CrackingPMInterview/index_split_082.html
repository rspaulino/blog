<p id="filepos437330" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Why These Questions Are Asked</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">As we said, behavioral questions are about your content and your communication. Within these categories though, there are multiple factors.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Content</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">In assessing the content of your response, an interviewer might be trying to drill into the following areas.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Have you </span></span><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">really</span></span></span><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic"> done what you say you’ve done?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">One important—and often overlooked—reason that interviewers ask behavioral questions is to validate that your resume really matches up with your experience. It’s not that the interviewer necessarily thinks you’re lying (although some candidates do); it’s that it’s often difficult to assess what someone did over weeks or months of work from a mere fifteen-word bullet.</p><p class="calibre_1">Imagine a resume bullet such as, “Implemented new process that led to 15% increase in user retention rates.”</p><p class="calibre_1">This seems pretty amazing, but is it really? The new “process” might have been a matter of just including a renewal link in an email. It was still a very good change, of course, but a change like that probably doesn’t indicate a ton about your future success.</p><p class="calibre_1">On the other hand, the change might be a lot more impressive than your bullet made it sound. One or two lines doesn’t offer you the chance to really explain why something was hard. Maybe implementing a new process required you to build a makeshift team, gather data, and perform complex analysis.</p><p class="calibre_1">The fact is n interviewer can’t bet their interpretation of a line on your resume matches what you actually did. Your accomplishment might have been a lot harder or a lot easier than you made it sound. Behavioral questions allow an interviewer to “dive deep” into your prior experiences.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">How have you made an impact?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">The scale of the situations you discuss also indicates something about how big your accomplishments have been and what you consider to be an accomplishment.</p><p class="calibre_1">For example, suppose you’re asked a question such as, “Tell me about a challenging problem you’ve faced.”</p><p class="calibre_1">That’s actually a very open-ended question. Your challenges could be teamwork issues, or they could be analytical or quantitative problems. They could even be personal issues.</p><p class="calibre_1">The scale and the type of the problems you select tells your interviewer a lot about the complexity of your professional history. This is especially true for questions about successes, failures, and challenges. If you haven’t had professional wins <span class="italic">and</span> losses, then many would argue that you haven’t really done much at all.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Do you have the relevant skills and attributes for the job?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">In addition to the above elements, behavioral questions are typically used to evaluate your skills and attributes. An interviewer might have a very particular skill or attribute in mind, such as leadership skills, or they might be asking a broader question to gain a sense for how you handle things.</p><p class="calibre_1">A question such as, “Tell me about a time when you’ve had to convince a manager of something,” is looking at how and why you influence people when you lack power.</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">Do you just go with whatever a manager says? If not, when do you speak up and why? Is it about your personal goals or those of a team? Is it about the short-term or the long-term goals?</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29">How do you influence someone when you don’t have the power to just make something happen? Do you gather data to support your conclusion? Do you rally support from those around you? Do you bring up risks or opportunities? What tools did you use to influence your manager, and which of those were successful? How did you adapt to your manager’s style?</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">Other questions might be broader. A question such as, “Tell me about a mistake you made,” is likely looking at a bunch of factors. Such a question gives an interviewer a sense of how you handle situations, if you’ve faced real challenges, how you recover from mistakes, and what you see as a mistake. It <span class="italic">also</span> shows an interviewer (hopefully!) that you can be humble and admit when you screw up.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Communication</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">There’s good news about behavioral questions: even if you can’t nail the content part, you can at least nail the communication part. The trick is to apply some specific structures.</p><p class="calibre_1">For people who struggle with communication issues, including non-native English speakers and those prone to rambling, this advice is especially important.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Nugget First</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">The “nugget first” structure is a simple one. It means to start off your response with the “nugget”—or thesis—of what your story will be about.</p><p class="calibre_1">For example, when your interviewer asks you about a challenge you faced at work, you might open your response with, “Sure, let me tell you about the time had an underperforming teammate.”</p><p class="calibre_1">Such as opener helps your interviewer focus on what you’re about to say, allowing them to slot all the bits of information you’re about to give them into that context. The remainder of your story feels more structured as a result. When you mention additional details, such as being behind on a deadline, your interviewer knows that the point of the story is the coworker, not the deadline.</p><p class="calibre_1">It also helps to focus <span class="italic">you</span> on what you’re about to say. You’ll be less likely to provide extraneous details because you know your answer is about the underperforming coworker.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Situation, Action, Result (S.A.R.)</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">The Situation, Action, Result structure can be used on its own or in conjunction with the Nugget First approach.</p><p class="calibre_1">The S.A.R. (also often called S.T.A.R.—Situation, Task, Action, Result) approach means to describe the following components:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Situation:</span> Your goal here is to provide <span class="italic">sufficient</span> background information to understand what you did and why it mattered. Be careful about overwhelming your interviewer with information that doesn’t truly inform them. For example, if you’re describing a project where your team was behind, it may not be necessary to describe the details of the project. Simply saying “We were working on a project for a key client” might be enough.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Action:</span> You then describe the actions you took. Note that the story should focus primarily on what <span class="italic">you</span> did, not what your team did. Your interviewer, after all, is hiring you.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Result:</span> Finally, you explain the results of your actions. How did you help your team or your company? How did people respond? When possible, quantify your impact. Tell your interviewer your actions led to a 10% increase in user retention, not just “greater” user retention.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">Suppose you’re asked the following question: “Tell me about a time when you had to influence a team.” You might have a story like this:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Nugget:</span> Sure, let me tell you about the time I needed to cut the scope of a project.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Situation:</span> To meet an important release deadline, we needed to cut a key feature. Unfortunately, this was a feature the developers were particularly excited about. If I just came out and told them, “Sorry, but no,” they’d be demoralized and feel that their opinion wasn’t valued.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Action:</span> I identified two developers as being particularly strong influencers, one because she was very senior and the other because he was very well liked. I focused on getting them on board with the decision first.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29">I met with the senior dev first to discuss the impending deadline and what it meant for the product’s architecture. We discussed options and consequences, and ultimately she arrived at the same conclusion: we needed to cut this feature.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_29">With the other developer, I told him about the discussion with the senior dev, appealing to this dev on more of an emotional level. I knew he valued his social status on the team, so I told him how much his support on this would mean to me. He shared his concerns about the team’s reaction and assured me that he would support me.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_29">I asked both developers to help me present the decision to the team.</li><li value="7" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Result:</span> The team was ultimately disappointed in the conclusion but sympathetic. Hearing two highly valued team members back the decision, they trusted that it was the right one. I pledged to them that, if we could push forward to get this release done ASAP, we’d start working on this feature right after that release.</li><li value="8" class="calibre_29">We ended up making the deadline with a day to spare and then getting that other feature out a few weeks later.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">By structuring your response this way, you allow the interviewer to clearly understand what was going on, what steps you took, and what the result was. Note that, in this case, there was no need to discuss what the feature was or why the developers were excited about it. It’s not relevant to this story.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Speak In Bullets</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Sometimes people joke that PMs speak in bullets, as though they’re always doing a PowerPoint presentation. This isn’t a bad thing; in fact, speaking in bullets can be a very good thing.</p><p class="calibre_1">When you’re speaking to an interviewer, or anyone, about an experience you had, they have far less context than you. It’s easy for them to get lost in a myriad of details and forget who is who in your story. Being very clear about the components of your goals, tasks, or results will help your interviewer.</p><p class="calibre_1">For example:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">“I did three things. First, I talked with … Second, I … And third, I …”</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29">“We had two issues with this plan. Number one, we … And number two, we …”</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">If you can picture what you say in a bullet list, and deliver it that way, your interviewer will have a much easier time dissecting the information.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_82"></div>
