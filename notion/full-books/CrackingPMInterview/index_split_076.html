<p id="filepos414749" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">“What do you like to do in your spare time?”</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">With this question, your interviewer is primarily looking to get to know you and what you’re interested in. The best answers to this question might show some sort of experience that’s relevant to the position, but discussing any passions that you have outside of work will be a positive.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Best Answers</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">The answers below show some relevance to the job by highlighting the candidate’s leadership abilities, technical talent, or initiative. All of these things make the candidate well suited to a PM role.</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">“I really enjoy exploring new technology. I’ve set a goal to build a simple to-do list application in as many languages as possible, just to learn a bit about what each programming language does. So far I’ve done this in five languages.”</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29">“I’ve been getting involved recently with online learning. I’ve taken a few online courses to learn a little bit about various roles, such as marketing, advertising, and finance. I’m also preparing to launch my own class on Product Management for Software Engineers.”</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29">“I’ve been doing a lot of volunteering for the animal shelter. A few months ago I created and launched a new program called Teens 4 Animals to get more teenagers involved. That program has recruited 50 new volunteers from local high schools and saved more than 100 dogs from being put to sleep.”</li></ul><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Good Answers</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">The answers below don’t show any particular relevance to a PM role, but they do show some interests outside of work. Most importantly, they’re all backed up with some concrete evidence that makes the interest sound more convincing.</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">“I read a lot. Most recently I’ve been reading a lot of psychology books. I’m really fascinated by how our minds work and why we make the choices we do. So much of it is counter-intuitive.”</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29">“I love playing ultimate frisbee. I play on a frisbee league at my company, and also joined a neighborhood pickup league.”</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29">“I really enjoy doing basic construction projects around my house. I still have a lot to learn, but I’ve had some recent successes. I re-did my patio a few months ago and it’s still standing. I guess that shows some promise.”</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29">“I’m the lead singer and primary songwriter for a punk rock band called Out Like Pluto. I co-founded the band with one of my bandmates, and I also handle most of the social media marketing for the group.”</li></ul><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">No-Value-Add Answers</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">It’s difficult to really screw up this question, but there are plenty of answers that won’t really help your case. The answers below are weak because they don’t show any passion. You go to work, come home, and then see your family and friends. This answer won’t hurt you a ton, but you’re losing the opportunity to add a new dimension to your job.</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">“I’m not sure. I guess I don’t really have a ton of true hobbies since I work a lot.”</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29">“I mostly just hang out with friends. We go out to dinner, sometimes wine tasting or something like that. I’ve also organized the occasional barbeque at my place.”</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29">“I spend a bunch of time just reading things on the internet—blogs, tech news, etc.”</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">Most people do have some hobbies and that can be backed up with evidence, if they think hard enough. Do you work out daily? Set a goal for yourself, like training for a marathon or developing ten new exercise routines per month. Do you spend a lot of time on the internet? Use that time productively by writing a blog or answering questions on Q&amp;A forums. Do you enjoy photography? Take some classes in it or set up an online portfolio, even if it’s not very good.</p><p class="calibre_1">You are not trying to account for all of your free time in this answer. You’re just trying to add a new dimension to your profile and talk about it credibly.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_76"></div>
