When you chat with the people at a career fair booth and hand over your resume, they’ll make some notes based on the impression you made. Those notes can mean the difference between getting an interview or having your resume ignored.</p><p class="calibre_1">Here are some tips to make the most of your time at career fairs:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre6">Research which companies will be at the career fair and decide which ones you are the most interested in. Check if they have PM roles available.</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre_25"><span class="calibre6">Pick out your best talking points. Think about what will make you stand out and look like a great PM candidate. Maybe it’s a challenging class project you took on, or maybe you had a great experience as a teaching assistant. Anything you’ve done to show initiative (Did you built an iPhone app for fun? Did you start a new competition in your city?) would be a great thing to discuss.</span></li><li value="3" class="calibre_25"><span class="calibre6">Practice a short intro that includes your talking points. Imagine walking up to the booth, saying hello, and introducing yourself in a way that will let you talk about your accomplishments in a non-awkward way.</span></li><li value="4" class="calibre_25"><span class="calibre6">Think of good questions to ask the company employees. You might not know ahead of time if the company is sending PMs, engineers, or just recruiters, so make sure you have some appropriate questions for each.</span></li><li value="5" class="calibre_25"><span class="calibre6">At the career fair, pay attention to how crowded the booths are. This can be a great time to get to know a smaller company and consider places you hadn’t thought of before. If the booth isn’t crowded, they’ll probably be willing to spend longer talking to you, which means more time for you to convince them you’re a good fit.</span></li><li value="6" class="calibre_25"><span class="calibre6">When you go up to a booth, let them know that you’re interested in the PM role, and ask who is the best person to talk to. They might be able to direct you to a PM, or at least to someone who is comfortable evaluating PMs.</span></li><li value="7" class="calibre_25"><span class="calibre6">Have a friendly conversation with the employee. Remember that at a career fair they’re trying to sell you on the company, so it’s entirely appropriate to ask questions. Tell them about why you’re interested in being a PM and why you think you’d be a good fit. Show interest in their company.</span></li><li value="8" class="calibre_25"><span class="calibre6">Don’t just hand over your resume without talking to people at the booth first. If you do, you’re missing out on the unique benefits of being able to talk to company employees firsthand.</span></li></ul><p class="calibre_1">While you do want to remain professional, don’t be afraid to do something a little different. It’s good to have some personality and passion! If you’ve built something particularly cool, you could show the booth staff some pictures or a very short demo.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_27"></div>
