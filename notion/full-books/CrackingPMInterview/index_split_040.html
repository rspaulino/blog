<p id="filepos226895" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Q &amp; A: Johanna Wright, VP at Google</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Tell me a little about your career path</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">I was a math major and then got my first job as a programmer at a small software company supporting the financial services industry. While I was there each of the new grads had one on one meetings with the company execs. When I met the Product Manager, Tom, I was blown away that he actually knew what the company should build. I dreamed that one day I would have the skills to know what we should build. That’s when I decided I wanted to become a Product Manager.</p><p class="calibre_1">I tried to become a PM in all kinds of backwards way—first I became a QA [Quality Assurance] manager, then I became an engineer again. Then, another startup doing an Internet platform was trying to recruit me. They wanted me to join as a QA manager, but I said I’d only come as a product manager or a programmer. And that’s how I became a PM.</p><p class="calibre_1">When the internet bubble collapsed that company went out of business and I moved to California. My husband and I decided to bicycle from Brooklyn to Los Angeles. I didn’t think I’d be able to get another PM job when the economy was such a disaster, but I thought I maybe I could get a project management contract. I was lucky enough to meet a friend of a friend while hiking and she hired me. Six months later I started business school at UCLA.</p><p class="calibre_1">For me, business school lent a lot of credibility. My startup was pretty unknown, my undergraduate school, Barnard, wasn’t well known for CS, and my networks weren’t strong. Business school wouldn’t be right for everyone—people who went to Stanford, or had prestigious jobs at other companies would not have as much of a credibility gap and may not need business school as much. But for me, given the job market at the time, it made sense.</p><p class="calibre_1">After business school I went to Google as a product manager. I had to hustle to get the job. There was a while where I had a weekly recurring entry in my calendar to “call Hilary”, a woman from Barnard’s alumni database who worked at Google. Eventually, once I got some other job offers, Hilary was comfortable enough to pass me along to a recruiter.</p><p class="calibre_1">At Google I’ve worked on a lot of teams. I started on Ads UI and then moved to the Search team where I launched Universal Search, Google Instant, and Knowledge Graph. After that I was ready for a new challenge, so I moved to Android where I’m now VP of Search and Assist</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">What were some of the key breakthrough moments in your career?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">My first PM job was a real breakthrough. I worked at a small company and could really define what a product manager was since I was the only one. The way I got that job was interesting. Back when I was a QA manager I had brunch with a couple of the founders of the company. I was really excited about my job and had a whole philosophy about how teams should be set up and run. Just from that brunch and seeing how passionate I was they wanted to hire me.</p><p class="calibre_1">The defining career moment for me at Google was working on Universal Search and launching it. It was an important project for the company and was known as a project that people hadn’t succeeded at before. Once I launched Universal Search I was promoted to Director.</p><p class="calibre_1">Being a QA manager was a grounding experience in my early career. It gave me perspective on how to use a product, know your users, have empathy for customers. My experience as a programmer was also really helpful to understand what programmers go through. Working anywhere in the software development process is a big help to being a PM.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">What advice do you have for people who want to become PMs and advance in their careers?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Do something fun. Do something important. I don’t think there is a single answer to career advancement. I have always tried to find jobs that will be fun and keep my brain engaged all day long. The biggest career leverage I have found is when I do something important for my company.</p><p class="calibre_1">Even more advice.</p><p class="calibre_1">Communicate what you are doing. In a big company you really need people above you who will allocate resources and get conflicting projects to be on your side, so messaging what you are achieving becomes important. With Universal Search, a baby step was the very first user study. We had to have a demo ready for the user study, and that was really important for the effort. People could see the product working and this helped communicate what we were trying to do.</p><p class="calibre_1">Don’t give up. When job hunting it’s important to be willing to talk to lots of people and not worry about rejection. It wasn’t that easy to get my job at Google. I was the last person in my MBA class to get an internship. Take heart, all these things can turn around.</p><p class="calibre_1">Find a boss who believes in you. At Google It was really important to me to have a manager who believed in me. It was great to have Marissa Mayer as a manager - she took chances on me. She gave me a chance to manage people when I hadn’t before. When I was 9 months pregnant, she suggested I present our search strategy to our executives. This was really important for my career because it had me in peoples’ minds as the person planning the search strategy. That’s all thanks to Marissa.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">What does it take to be a great PM?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">The great PMs I’ve worked with are very different from each other. That’s why it is an awesome job. You see people who are full of energy and able to motivate people through their ideas, people rooted in technical capabilities, or people people who get things done through relationships.</p><p class="calibre_1">That said, all great PMs are goal oriented. They’re able to get things done, focus, prioritize. One mistake junior PMs at Google (and probably at other other big companies too) make is to go to too many meetings and think their work is done. A good PM defines what it takes to achieve her goals. Less effective PMs let their schedules sway how they get things done and it gets in their way.</p><p class="calibre_1">Great PMs care about their users. They use their product. They do not finish when the spec is done but make sure to to use a working version inside and out. They have great follow through to get things done.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_40"></div>
