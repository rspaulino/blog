They’re challenging for good reason: easy problems wouldn’t help interviewers distinguish great candidates from just so-so candidates.</p><p class="calibre_1">What many candidates don’t realize though is that you aren’t expected to solve a tough problem immediately. It’s great if you can, but it’s often not realistic. A tough problem can often take the entire interview to solve, even with some guidance from the interviewer.</p><p class="calibre_1">Evaluation of your performance is not about whether you got the problem “right” or not. This has little meaning. Rather, the evaluation is a lot more qualitative and, frankly, subjective:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">How willing were you to solve the problem? If you get scared and give up, that’s a red flag. Interviewers want candidates who are excited about solving hard problems. They tend to make good employees.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29">How quickly did you solve it?</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29">How optimal was your algorithm?</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29">How did you approach the problem?</li><li value="5" class="calibre_29">How much help did you need?</li><li value="6" class="calibre_29">How clean was your code?</li><li value="7" class="calibre_29">How was your communication in discussing the problem? How did you react to feedback and guidance from the interviewer?</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">None of these aspects are yes/no decisions.</p><p class="calibre_1">An interviewer is not given metrics to decide how quick is “quick” on a problem, or how many bugs constitutes “buggy.” How then does she determine how you did?</p><p class="calibre_1">She determines performance by comparing you—indirectly—to other candidates. That is, the first time she asks the question she doesn’t have a good feel for whether X minutes is fast or slow. As she asks more and more people the same question, it starts becoming clearer. When other people typically take 20 - 30 minutes to solve a question and you get it in 10 minutes, she knows that you solved it quickly.</p><p class="calibre_1">Because the evaluation is relative, it’s also extremely difficult to judge by yourself how you did in an interview. You may feel you struggled, but you don’t know how much other candidates struggled.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_109"></div>
