<p id="filepos137326" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Do you need an MBA?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">An MBA isn’t a requirement for product management, and at some startups it might even count against you. On the other hand, teams with more of a business focus consider an MBA a real asset, and some companies, such as Amazon, explicitly focus on hiring MBAs.</p><p class="calibre_1">Arjun, who got an MBA after starting as a PM at Microsoft, decided to go to business school when he noticed that well-designed products didn’t always become market winners. “I saw that good design isn’t enough,” Arjun noted. “There’s something else, and I wanted to learn what that something else is. In business school I realized you could ask business questions and answer them really easily, on the back of a napkin.”</p><p class="calibre_1">This analytical approach to products changed how Arjun thought about features and prioritization. Instead of guessing what users would want, he started thinking about which metrics he wanted to drive.</p><p class="calibre_1">Here are some tips on how to get the most out of your time in business school if you’re interested in product management:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre6">Take the chance to start something. Gain experience by launching projects, joining clubs, or building something. This will help you avoid the biggest MBA pitfall: being someone who only wants to tell people what to do, and doesn’t know how to actually do things.</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre_25"><span class="calibre6">Take project-based classes where you can work on your ideas. This lets you make double use of class time, and you have the added benefit: a team of MBAs helping you out.</span></li><li value="3" class="calibre_25"><span class="calibre6">Practice designing products by sharing your mockups with classmates and iterating based on their feedback.</span></li><li value="4" class="calibre_25"><span class="calibre6">Choose relevant classes like entrepreneurship, marketing, or consumer behavior.</span></li></ul><p class="calibre_1">Chris, who got an MBA after being an engineering program manager (EPM), found a lot of benefits from business school. “An MBA gets you experience, connections, ideas, resources, seed funding, and partnerships. Business schools provide a lot of resources,” he said.</p><blockquote class="calibre_23"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Does your online persona matter?</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_6">It’s pretty common for people to have a big online presence these days. From Twitter to Quora to personal websites, there are a lot of ways to get your ideas out there. So should you spend a lot of effort building your website or tweeting?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_23">There are two main places where your online persona will come into play: recruiting and startups. Recruiters often search online to find qualified candidates and may reach out to you to apply based on your online content. If you’re hoping to get noticed, being active online can pay off.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_23">LinkedIn is one of the most valuable sites to focus on for recruiting. One way to optimize your profile is to look at PMs with jobs you’re interested in and see what their profiles look like and how they stood out. You can also pay for a premium account to see how people are currently finding your profile and optimize around that.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_23">If you’re applying to startups, you might also find that some of your interviewers will look you up and notice your online content.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_23">However, at larger companies it will be much rarer that interviewers will research you in advance and discover your website or posts. If you do have a great website, you can include it on your resume or try to bring it up during your interviews. But otherwise, don’t worry about it!</blockquote><p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Current PMs</span></span></p><p class="calibre_1">If you’re a current product manager, moving to the same role at another company is pretty straightforward. If you’ve already worked as a product manager at a well-known software company, that experience is usually enough to get you an interview at another. There’s still room to build up your experience though:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre6">Launch! The most important way a product manager is judged is by the products she’s launched. If your team is close to launch but not quite there, you might want to wait until the product is fully launched to start applying. Likewise, if you’re on a team with a very long ship cycle, you might consider switching to a team with more frequent launches so you can get the experience of seeing a product through the entire cycle.</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre_25"><span class="calibre6">File for patents. While software patents are a very controversial topic, many companies still see them as a necessary evil. If you work for a company that files patents, make sure you file patents for your innovations. A patent application is a great way to make your resume stand out.</span></li><li value="3" class="calibre_25"><span class="calibre6">Take on responsibilities to round out your skills. If you’ve always been really strong in product design, see if you can learn data analysis. If you’ve been working on deep technical problems, see if you can spend some time doing user research.</span></li></ul><p class="calibre_1">If you’re trying to move from a less prestigious company to a more prestigious one, these tips can be especially useful.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_28"></div>
