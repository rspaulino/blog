<p id="filepos262961" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Amazon</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">Amazon candidates start off with two short phone screens. These are just 30 minutes, and they typically don’t drill too deeply into your skills. They’re mainly looking to understand your background to see if you should be brought onsite.</p><p class="calibre_1">The onsite interviews consist of four to six in-person interviews, each about an hour long.</p><p class="calibre_1">Interviewers will be looking to see how you match up against Amazon’s 14 leadership principles (see: <a href="index_split_119.html#filepos1044492">Amazon Leadership Principles</a>), with each interviewer covering two to three principles. If an interviewer doesn’t feel that she did an adequate job covering one, she might ask another interview to follow up.</p><p class="calibre_1">Of these 14 principles, an ability to get things done (“bias for action” and “deliver results”) and customer obsession are particularly important.</p><p class="calibre_1">One of your interviewers will be the “bar raiser.” The bar raiser is a special interviewer from another team. This interviewer is tasked with “raising the bar” and ensuring you are better than 50 percent of Amazon PMs. He is often easy to pick out from your interviewers: he’s the one brought in from another team.</p><p class="calibre_1">The bar raiser is also often the person who will challenge you the most. For example, he might be testing the “having backbone” value. Do you have a position that you can back up while respectfully disagreeing? Don’t be surprised if the interviewer continues digging into something until you’ve given a satisfactory answer.</p><p class="calibre_1">You will also likely interview with a hiring manager.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">How Decisions Get Made</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">After your interview, your interviewers will meet to discuss your performance. The bar raiser is responsible for the interview process and gets veto power. The hiring manager also gets veto power; it’s her team, after all. This means you need to impress both the hiring manager and the bar raiser (and ideally everyone else, too).</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Special Focuses</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Amazon tends not to focus too much on technical skills, although some technical aptitude might be expected in more technical teams like Amazon Web Services. What the company cares about more are your business skills and background.</p><p class="calibre_1">All of Amazon’s leadership principles are important, but the Customer Obsession one is especially important. When in doubt, do what’s right for the customer (even if it isn’t the right “business” decision).</p><p class="calibre_1">Many Amazon questions deal with pricing specifically, so make sure you think about how different Amazon products (e.g., Amazon Prime) are priced. Think about what you would change.</p><p class="calibre_1">Amazon interviewers like to dig deep into your resume. That line you have about how your feature boosted efficiency by 30 percent? You’d better back that up. Be prepared to justify exactly how it did this and exactly how you measure this impact. Hand-waviness won’t cut it.</p><p class="calibre_1">Finally, these leadership principles are not a joke. If you pay attention and know the leadership principles well, you might recognize which one an interviewer has in mind with a particular question. You can then address it directly. Better yet, prepare for this; review your resume with these leadership principles in mind.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_47"></div>
