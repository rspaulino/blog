<p id="filepos419889" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">“Where do you see yourself in five years?”</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">This question scares candidates, in part because they think that interviewers are asking it to trip them up in some way. Not so.</p><p class="calibre_1">An interviewer asks this question for several reasons:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">To understand if you actually want this job:</span> If the role doesn’t fit into your long-term goals, it’s a good tip-off to your interviewer you are just looking at this as a short-term job to fill in the gaps. Moreover, if you’re not prepared to answer this question, it might be a sign you don’t really care about the job.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">To see if you even have a plan:</span> Successful people tend to know where they’re going in life. If you don’t have a plan, an interviewer might worry you’re not very serious about your career.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">To test your ambition:</span> Ambitious people generally make good employees. If your long-term goals reflect a lack of ambition, that’s not a good sign. Similarly, if you’re unrealistically ambitious, that also isn’t a good sign. You have expectations the company can’t match, and you’re unlikely to be a good fit.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">To ensure the company can give you what you want:</span> If a role isn’t a good fit for your long-term goals, the company wants to know that. You’d be unhappy in the job, would likely be unsuccessful, and would quickly leave. That’s not a good thing for anyone.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">Ideally, you will have 5-year, 10-year, and 20-year plans, and this role will fit nicely in line with that.</p><p class="calibre_1">If you don’t have things quite as nicely planned as this, you can think of the answer to this question a different way: Where would very strong performance in this role get you in five years? Hopefully, that is where you see yourself.</p><p class="calibre_1">If you’re prepared for it, this question can be a great opportunity. You can use it to tell the interviewer whatever you want about yourself.</p><blockquote class="calibre_23"><span class="italic">I’d love to be lead PM for an emerging business unit where I’ll get to think about long-term strategy, particularly with respect to monetization models. I’m particularly interested in mobile, and I could see myself leading a team of PMs and engineers on the mobile side. Additionally, I’m really excited about the ways in which a company can help new employees ramp up faster. I could see myself creating a more formal new employee training program where employees get mentorship and training in different areas of the business.</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_19">With this answer, the candidate has demonstrated ambition as well as a passion for business models, leadership, and mentorship.</p><p class="calibre_1">You can use your answers to the career vision question to highlight what you’re good at and what most excites you.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_77"></div>
