<p id="filepos176122" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Tips and Tricks for Career Advancement</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">Working hard will help you be more successful, but it’s not enough. The person with the most hours is not always the one who lands the promotion.</p><p class="calibre_1">What’s equally or more important is how you work and what you work on. As you build your career, these tips will help you achieve greater success.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Ship great products</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">As a PM, the biggest measure of your success will be the products you launch. More so than any of the mocks you drew or specs you wrote or bugs you triaged, you’ll be recognized for how well your products do in the market. If customers love your product and you’ve got a viral growth rate, you’re in good shape.<br class="calibre1"/>
<br class="calibre1"/> At the end of the day, people won’t know all of the big and little things you did to make the launch possible. They will remember that you led the team that delivered a successful product.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Get some launches under your belt</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">The product life cycle, from planning through implementation to launch and beyond, sets the main rhythm for a PM. Each part of the life cycle requires different product management skills, so if you want to learn and improve, you’ll want to go through the whole life cycle several times.<br class="calibre1"/>
<br class="calibre1"/> The product life cycle varies in length from team to team. When you’re starting out, you can pick up experience more quickly by finding teams with shorter launch cycles.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Become the expert</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">When you join a new team and all of your teammates seem so smart, it can be tempting to just shuttle questions to other people since they know so much. But if you’re just passing questions to other people, you’re not really adding a lot of value.</p><p class="calibre_1">Instead, make sure you really take the time to become the expert on your areas and your customers. Think about what kinds of research you can do to really understand the space. Maybe you’ll want to visit customers or put together a competitive analysis. You can look at data and metrics, or you can chat with the sales team. Talk to as many stakeholders as you can, and learn the background from your team.</p><p class="calibre_1">Once you’ve done your homework, you’ll feel like you really understand the space and you can confidently make decisions.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Find teams where you can pick up new skills</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">“Seniority is all about experience, but there’s a catch,” says Chrix Finne, a senior product manager at Optimizely (and formerly Google). “You can control how fast you accumulate experiences.”</p><p class="calibre_1">If you’ve mostly worked on improving a mature product, consider joining a team building a new, unlaunched product. If you’ve always worked on consumer-facing products, consider trying something business facing. Look at your skillset, decide which skills you need, and then find a place where you can learn those skills.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Pick the company where you’ll learn the most</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">At different stages in your career there will be different things you need to learn. You can optimize your learning by choosing a company that’s set up to support you.</p><p class="calibre_1">When you’re a brand new PM, you’ll need to learn the basics of product management. You might want to pick a company that has several strong PMs to learn from.</p><p class="calibre_1">Working closely with PMs is an excellent way to pick up the trade. After you’ve been a product manager for a while you might want to increase your responsibilities and learn how to work more independently, so you might want to pick a smaller company.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Choose a growing company</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">At a growing company, new opportunities are always opening up, and you quickly become one of the more senior employees. This means that even if you had to join a different team or take on different title from what you wanted, you’d likely get a chance to transition soon.</p><p class="calibre_1">“If you’re in a growing company and working on a product you’re excited about, there will always be more opportunities.” said Sara, a PM at Twitter who started on internal tools and then moved to customer-facing teams.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Find a manager who believes in you</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Many great PMs credit their success to great managers who gave them opportunities to prove themselves. When you’re choosing a team, don’t just look at the product - also consider who your manager would be.</p><p class="calibre_1">You can often talk to other PMs at the company to learn who the best managers are and who are the managers to avoid. Once you have a good manager, show them you are reliable and can do good work. Then, talk to them about how you want your career to grow, and be brave enough to take on the challenges they give you.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Focus on your own efficiency.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">As a PM, you’re bombarded with tasks, and you need to know what you can drop. You want to be responsive to your team and never become a bottleneck, so it’s important to prioritize how you spend your time.</p><p class="calibre_1">If you have trouble getting to “Inbox Zero” (no messages in your inbox), try learning a time management system like Getting Things Done. A few small changes to your routine can sometimes make a big difference in how organized you are. As you become more efficient, you will feel like you are gaining hours in the day.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Understand how your role fits into the company.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Career advancement as a PM usually means expanding the scope of the area you work on. You might start by working on a feature, move to PM-ing a larger area, and then eventually own a whole product or even a product suite.<br class="calibre1"/>
<br class="calibre1"/> To grow in this way, you need to understand how the pieces fit together to see the bigger picture. Ask “How does my feature fit into the product?” and then, “How does this product fit into the suite of products?” Think about the connections to get a broader picture.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Help your team with something tangible early on.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Most teams are a little bit suspicious of new PMs. They’re worried you’ll create busy work for them or slow them down in other ways. It doesn’t help that most of the work a PM does is behind the scenes, so your coworkers might not see how hard you work. You can counteract their fear by focusing on helping out your team when you’re new.</p><p class="calibre_1">Look around your team to find some grunt work you can take off of someone’s hands, or do some research that people have been putting off (but really wish they had done). This is an easy way to get off to a good start with your new team and earn goodwill that will help you in the future.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Work on something that’s important to your team and the company.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Many companies will start new people off on unsexy work because it’s a low-risk way to see what you can do. In these cases, you want to do an amazing job on your unsexy piece and prove you can be trusted with more important work. Then you can find areas you think are important and offer to contribute to those.<br class="calibre1"/>
<br class="calibre1"/> Make sure you draw the distinction between teams that are just unglamorous and teams that are truly unimportant. Infrastructure teams often don’t sound like a fun place to be a PM, but they’re critically important to the company. The improvements you make as an infrastructure PM can be magnified throughout the company, so they can be a great place for career advancement.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Take on cross-team or company-wide tasks.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">At some point in your career, your visibility across the company is going to matter if you want to be promoted to higher positions. Sometimes you can get this visibility just by launching big projects that are important to the company, but there are other ways to get your name out there.</p><p class="calibre_1">By leading and doing a good job on big company-wide projects such as UI reviews or goal setting, you help more people across the company think about you as a good PM. Similarly, you can teach a class or present at an all-hands. When a committee is deciding if you’ll get promoted to the next level, it’s great for all of them to have heard your name and appreciated your work.</p><p class="calibre_1">Another reason this cross-team work is valuable is that it helps you form relationships with people throughout the company. Sometimes work between teams can be tough, but it goes much more smoothly if you already have a friendly relationship with the PM on the other team.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Define and measure success.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">One way to really stand out as a PM is to get more concrete about what success means for your team. Depending on the project, success might mean more user growth, increased revenue, or increased customer engagement. For other projects you might have a more specific feature-based goal.</p><p class="calibre_1">Think about what you’re aiming for, communicate that to your team, and measure whether you’re hitting it. This makes it clear when you’re achieving your goals and helps you learn when you don’t. Once you’re clear about your goals, you can better prioritize what work is helping you and what work is unimportant.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Don’t let your team do unimportant work.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Sometimes big companies lose track of all the projects going on, and you might be assigned as the only PM for a team that’s really not delivering much value for the company.</p><p class="calibre_1">Ideally, you’d redirect the team to work on something more important. If that’s not possible, consider suggesting to your manager that the team be shut down (make sure you do your research and can support this) or consider switching to another team. It will be hard to get promoted launching a product that doesn’t matter.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Don’t just do what’s asked of you. Get the job done.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">As a new PM, it can be tempting to think of your work in terms of deliverables such as proposals, specs, and analyses, and then to think you’re done once the document is written.</p><p class="calibre_1">Those documents aren’t your job; they’re just the tools you use to get results. Make sure your engineers use the specs to build features, or rewrite the specs or find another way to get your ideas across. If you made a proposal, did you convince your team to pick it up? If not, find another way to make your point.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Demonstrate you can consistently deliver work at the next level.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Most of the larger companies have an explicit career ladder with descriptions of the skills needed at each level. These ladders can be frustrating because they look so explicit and concrete, and yet PMs can meet all the requirements for their current level without being promoted.</p><p class="calibre_1">Two things are going on here. First, you need to meet all the requirements for the next level before being promoted into it. Second, you need to have earned a reputation for consistently and repeatedly delivering work at that level. Sometimes you’ll have shown you can deliver on a requirement once, but your team doesn’t have the confidence yet that you’ll be able to repeat that.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Find a mentor (or mentors).</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">PMs have all kinds of different skills. Some people are really good at coming up with a vision for their team, while others are great at data analysis or design. Identify people who you think are really strong in an area and reach out to them.<br class="calibre1"/>
<br class="calibre1"/> When reaching out to a mentor, be specific. Maybe you’re trying to build a case for your idea and reach out to someone who’s really persuasive to ask for help on how to frame your proposal. Maybe you want to show your mocks to someone who’s really strong in usability. Being purposeful makes the relationship better for both of you.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Build credibility.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">“Credibility is the currency of a PM,” says Daniel, a Google engineer who became a Google PM. As a PM, you want to gain the respect of everyone you work with, whether they be other product managers or people from other roles. You especially want to earn a good reputation with leaders of other teams so they’ll want their people to work with you.</p><p class="calibre_1">The most straightforward way to build credibility is delivering results. Your teammates all want a good outcome, so they’ll naturally start out second guessing your opinions, asking lots of questions, and suggesting different ways of doing things. However, over time they’ll start to see that you’re showing good judgment and getting things done, and they’ll feel comfortable trusting you.</p><p class="calibre_1">Another way to build credibility is paying attention to people’s perceptions of you and ensuring that you’re creating the perception you want. Make sure you’re building a reputation as a smart, skillful, competent, and dependable person with good judgment. It can be hard to get feedback directly from people on your reputation, so it might be worthwhile to ask your manager.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_35"></div>
