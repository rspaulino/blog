<p id="filepos97357" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Amazon</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">Amazon’s culture is guided by their 14 Leadership Principles (see: <a href="index_split_119.html#filepos1044492">Amazon Leadership Principles</a>). While many companies may have their own set of principles, Amazon’s Leadership Principles play a real role both in hiring and in day-to-day work. In meetings, people will cite leadership principles to help resolve decisions, and interviewers will look for these qualities in candidates.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Who they recruit</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Amazon has a lot going on. There are new initiatives being started, technical operational programs that are ongoing, and non-technical operational programs. There are teams that focus on audiences as diverse as consumers, publishers, and developers. Because of this, there are many different roles that relate to product and program management.</p><p class="calibre_1">Product managers are the product owners. They focus on the vision of a product. Amazon prefers MBAs for the product manager role and will hire people right out of business school. Unlike many other companies, Amazon does not require PMs to have a technical background.</p><p class="calibre_1">Technical program managers are responsible for the day-to-day execution of technical projects. TPMs need a strong technical background and can come directly out of school or by transferring from an engineering role. TPMs work closely with engineers.</p><p class="calibre_1">Program managers are responsible for the project management of non-technical projects, such as those on Operations. Program managers can come from any background, but skill with SQL is a plus. Amazon looks for program managers who are smart, fast, and can work under pressure. Program managers are responsible for running and improving the team’s processes.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">What they Do</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Product managers own the vision and roadmap for their team. Amazon values customer obsession, and many new ideas will come from figuring out what customers want and need. This can be from talking to customers directly or by looking at data that’s available via SQL. Amazon is very data driven, so PMs need to have strong analytical skills.</p><p class="calibre_1">When a PM comes up with an idea, he puts together a business case in a memo, also called a narrative. This document will cover the details of the recommendation and analysis that supports it, especially including numbers about the impact and rationale. Amazon focuses on documents instead of presentations for new proposals because documents force the author to be precise and show clear thinking.</p><p class="calibre_1">After initial rounds of revisions and redlines, the proposal is then shared with upper management in a meeting that starts with everyone silently reading the document at the same time. This process might seem strange at first, but it guarantees that everyone has time to read the details of the proposal and gets everyone focused. After everyone has read the document, people ask questions about it.</p><p class="calibre_1">The proposal may then go through a few more rounds; the key is precision in drawing a line from inputs to expected outcomes. After the proposal has the green light, the team starts building it. Many teams follow an Agile process, where the PM is the product owner and is responsible for writing user stories and the team’s backlog.</p><p class="calibre_1">When products are ready for launch, the PM works with the marketing team and prepares for a hand off to the Operations team that will run the program on an ongoing basis.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_21"></div>
