<p id="filepos371419" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">A Great Cover Letter</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">Following the above template won’t win you any awards, but it will basically get the job done. The job, of course, is to get someone to consider your resume (or at least not rule it out).</p><p class="calibre_1">On rare occasions, a cover letter can substantially increase a candidate’s odds.</p><p class="calibre_1">Consider this cover letter for a candidate at an education startup:</p><blockquote class="calibre_23"><span class="italic">As you might notice from my 2.7 GPA, academics have never really been my thing. But I love learning, and it’s the delta between academics and learning that makes me so excited about FusionEd.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">I was only a so-so student. School’s grades-driven approach didn’t allow me to spend less time on the subjects I hated in favor of those I loved. And, even if I wanted to explore a topic more deeply, I lacked the resources and structure to do so. FusionEd’s mission of child-driven education will tackle this issue and I want to be a part of that.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">Academics aside, I truly love learning, and especially learning about technology. Last year, I taught myself to code and I’ve since entered several hackathons. In the latest one, I was proud to be the only single-person team to receive an award. You can see some of my projects on my GitHub profile, including one targeted at students.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">In my professional life as a product manager with Colapa, I lead a team of six developers. My day-to-day work includes everything from feature design, to market research, to simple coding. I wear many hats, and it’s one of the things I love about the role. One of my proudest accomplishments though was finding a way to reposition our product to capture the enterprise market. This now represents 15% of revenue.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">Most recently, I worked on developing an API for Colapa. I understand that FusionEd is heading in a similar direction, and I am excited to take on this challenge again. I am confident my love for technology, learning, and leadership – plus my dislike for the status quo in education – will enable me to make an impact on FusionEd.</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_19">This wouldn’t necessarily be a great cover letter for all companies, but it’s a great cover letter for the right company. It’s honest and sincere, with just a little bit of a quirky punch in the beginning. The tone will work beautifully for a smaller startup that cares deeply about its mission to transform education.</p><p class="calibre_1">On the skills side, this candidate has shown:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">Initiative (by learning to code).</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29">Passion for technology (by learning to code and by competing in hackathons).</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29">A willingness to take risks (by competing in hackathons, despite being vastly under-qualified).</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29">Intelligence (by winning hackathons).</li><li value="5" class="calibre_29">Leadership (by repositioning the current product).</li><li value="6" class="calibre_29">A love for entrepreneurship (by being at a startup and by “wearing many hats”).</li><li value="7" class="calibre_29">Successfulness (by successfully repositioning the product).</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">This is the way you should dissect your cover letter. Think carefully about the role each sentence plays. What skills and attributes are demonstrated in your cover letter? Remember that your cover letter does not need to be a comprehensive list of all your experience; your resume is attached, too.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_64"></div>
