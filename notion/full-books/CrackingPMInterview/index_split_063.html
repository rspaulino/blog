<p id="filepos367321" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">The Cover Letter Template</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">A traditional cover letter fits a fairly standard template. The exact order of these paragraphs (namely the second and third) can be rearranged, but a good cover letter typically includes these elements.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Addressing the Reader</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">A simple “Dear __________” works fine. If you know the name of the person you’re addressing, use it. Never, ever say “Dear Sir” unless you know for a fact the reader is male. That is an excellent way to get rejected.</p><blockquote class="calibre_23"><span class="italic">Dear _______________,</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_19"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Opening Paragraph</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">In the first paragraph, briefly introduce who you are and what position you’re seeking. There’s no need to state your name; that will be in your signature. If you have a personal connection with the company or an interesting way you heard about the position, this is a good place to mention it.</p><blockquote class="calibre_23"><span class="italic">I recently attended the WYSIWYG Developer Conference, and I was thrilled when ChattyCha’s CEO mentioned an opening for a product manager on the API team. As a developer-turned-PM, I believe this position would be an excellent fit for my background and interests.</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_19"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Second Paragraph</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Here you discuss how your background makes you a good fit for the position. This should not be a summary of your roles; that’s what your resume is for. Rather, what this paragraph does is connect your skills and accomplishments with what the company is seeking.</p><p class="calibre_1">This paragraph should highlight your soft skills and back them up with accomplishments.</p><blockquote class="calibre_23"><span class="italic">I am a deeply technical person who loves motivating others to achieve a difficult goal. During my first year as a developer at Microsoft, I found a way to resolve a long-standing issue with a key framework by leveraging a new technology. I recruited and trained a team of three engineers, and later became dev lead on a related feature. I took this passion for problem solving to Waffle, an enterprise-security startup, where I successfully launched the company’s flagship feature – one that many thought would fail due to its complexity.</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_19"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Third Paragraph</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Next, you explain why you’re excited about this role. You don’t want to make this paragraph too long, as the prior paragraph is more important. You just want to show you care about this position and it’s not just another company you’re applying to.</p><blockquote class="calibre_23"><span class="italic">I am excited about the challenge of ChattyCha’s mission. I love deep technical challenges. The developer tools space is particularly interesting to me, having experienced the frustration of inadequate tools for my personal and professional coding projects. I am eager to help make this space better.</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_19"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Fourth Paragraph</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">The final paragraph is very short and just concludes the letter with a “thank you.”</p><blockquote class="calibre_23"><span class="italic">Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to hearing from you about this opportunity.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">Sincerely,</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">Your Name</span></blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_63"></div>
