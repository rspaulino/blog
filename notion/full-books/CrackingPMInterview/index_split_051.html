Even the best candidate in the world won’t get an interview with a lousy resume. After all, a company wouldn’t know that she’s the best candidate in the world.</p><p class="calibre_1">And, in fact, many great candidates do have lousy resumes. They lack perspective about their own experience, get confused by out-of-date advice from career counselors, don’t back up what they’ve done with specifics, or write generic lofty statements that end up meaning nothing to the resume screeners.</p><p class="calibre_1">A bad resume is an issue for any job, but especially so for product management roles. Communication is an important PM skill, and your resume is one clear way to demonstrate that. A PM who can’t express her skills and accomplishments in a clear, concise, and effective way is a bit worrisome. Much more so than in other roles, you’ll be judged for the quality of your resume.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_51"></div>
