<p id="filepos276325" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">The Rules</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">Every rule has its exception, but they’re called rules for a reason. Proceed carefully if you think one of these rules doesn’t apply to you.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Rule #1: Shorter is Better</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Imagine I wanted to tell you as much about myself as I can, but your attention span is only 15 seconds. Should I give you my 300-page autobiography? Or my condensed one-paragraph version?</p><p class="calibre_1">The 300-page version will have a lot more information, but that doesn’t matter. In 15 seconds, you’ll only have time to read the first paragraph. I’d be lucky if you learned where I was born in that time. Although I offered more information, you actually learned a lot less about me.</p><p class="calibre_1">A long resume is like that. It takes all your best content and then mixes in less important information, leaving the resume reader with a worse overall impression of you.</p><p class="calibre_1">It’s best to stick to just the highlights.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Implementing This Rule</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">A good rule of thumb is to limit your resume to one page if you have less than 10 years of experience. At more than 10 years, you might be able to justify 1.5 or 2 pages, particularly if you’ve held many different jobs.</p><p class="calibre_1">Before you say you can’t possibly fit everything you’ve done on one page, you’re right; you can’t. However, you can fit the most important things on one page. You might have to be more concise, but that’s a good thing. This means that you’re sticking to the highlights.</p><p class="calibre_1">When you’re thinking you need more space for a particular role, ask yourself what about that role is most important. Is it the fact you were a coder at one point? Is it the impact you had in reducing the company’s costs? Is it just the name of the company?</p><p class="calibre_1">Focus on what is important, and leave out the rest.</p><p class="calibre_1">Also, if just a few lines force your resume onto another page, find a way to trim down your resume. A resume that just barely goes onto a second page suggests a poor ability to prioritize.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Rule #2: Bullets, Not Blobs</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Many people live by a rule of “talk more about what’s more important.” There is some wisdom to this guidance, but it can backfire on a resume. The longer a chunk of text is, the less likely a resume screener is to read the resume.</p><p class="calibre_1">Blobs of text—that is, bullets or paragraphs that are three lines or longer—tend to not be read. Keep things short.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Implementing This Rule</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Read through your resume. Anything that’s three lines of text or more should be condensed. Additionally, you should aim to have no more than 50 percent of your bullets expand to two lines. That is, at least half of your bullets should be just one line, with the remainder being two lines.</p><p class="calibre_1">Depending on the situation, this might require alternative word choices, or it might require cutting out some of the details. The impact of your work often matters more than the details, so it’s okay to skimp here.</p><p class="calibre_1">Additionally, if just a few words of a bullet cause it to flow to the next line, trim it. You will waste space otherwise.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Rule #3: Accomplishments, Not Responsibilities</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">People don’t care what you were told to do; they care what you did.</p><p class="calibre_1">Responsibilities are about what you were told to do. Statements outlining these offer only a broad, fluffy overview of what you were supposed to do in your job. They don’t make it clear if you actually had an impact. Moreover, your responsibilities are often pretty obvious. We know, broadly speaking, what a product manager or a software developer would do at a company.</p><p class="calibre_1">Instead, you want to focus on your accomplishments. Prove to the resume screener you had an impact.</p><p class="calibre_1">Consider the difference between these two bullets:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Responsibility Oriented:</span> Design features for Amazon S3 and oversee development of the features across software engineers and testers.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Accomplishment Oriented:</span> Designed the SS Frontline feature, managed its development, and led its integration across three products, leading to an additional $10 million in revenue.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">While the first bullet gives some some information about what you did, the reader won’t walk away saying “You were a success because_____.” Make your resume look more like the second bullet. That shows success.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Implementing This Rule</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Using the present tense is a good tip-off that you’ve listed a responsibility. It’s difficult for something you accomplished to be written in the present tense.</p><p class="calibre_1">Making your resume accomplishment oriented goes beyond that, though. After all, if you took the earlier example bullet and converted it to past tense, it still wouldn’t be a true accomplishment.</p><p class="calibre_1">Instead, list the concrete ways you had an impact. Focus on the impact itself; the “what” more so than the “how” (although both are important).</p><p class="calibre_1">As much as possible, quantify your accomplishments. How much money did you make for your company? How much time did you save your team? By how much did you improve customer retention? An estimation is okay here.</p><p class="calibre_1">If you have an existing resume, it might help to start from scratch with one of these questions in mind:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">What are the five things you are most proud of?</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29">What would your team say are the five most impactful things you did?</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">The answers to these questions should form your bullets.</p><p class="calibre_1">Your responsibilities should generally be clear from your specific accomplishments and from your job title. However, if you feel you must explain your general responsibilities, a good place is immediately under the job title and in italics, so as to separate it from your true accomplishments.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Rule #4: Use a Good Template</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Every few months, some website or blog publishes a list of “amazing” resume designs which, undoubtedly, a bunch of job seekers attempt to copy. Such resumes use infographic-style charts or mockup a resume in the style of the Amazon.com homepage or the iOS homescreen.</p><p class="calibre_1">These resumes are cute, they might show some degree of creativity, and they might even grab someone’s attention. But unless you’re one of the lucky few to garner some media attention for your flashy design (or you’re applying for a designer position), a resume template like this will generally hurt you.</p><p class="calibre_1">Many hiring managers hate these graphical resumes because it’s hard to learn much about you. Information isn’t presented in a clear way, and the information that is presented takes up way more space than necessary.</p><p class="calibre_1">A good resume template won’t make your friends “ooh” and “ahh.” It probably won’t be flashy or particularly creative. But it will get the job done—which means landing you an interview.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Implementing This Rule</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">A good resume is reasonably compact and quickly showcases your highlights.</p><p class="calibre_1">Look for a resume template with the following:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Two or three columns, one for company names and the other for jobs titles.</span> You want to make this information very easy to pick out, especially if you have a top company on your resume. Location and dates are considerably less important. They need to be there, but they don’t need to leap out at the resume screener.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">No left column dedicated to headings.</span> Many resume templates use the left side of the page for headings such as “Employment” and “Education.” This looks attractive, but can waste 20 percent of the available space.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Limited text stylings.</span> Too many fonts, sizes, casings, and colors can be distracting.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Reasonable use of whitespace.</span> Too much whitespace wastes space. Too little can make your resume difficult to read and can suggest that you’re not good at prioritizing.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Reasonable font size and margins.</span> You want something that’s easy to read while not being wasteful with space.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Bullets.</span> Blocks of text look pretty (particularly on a graphical resume), but will be skipped over.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">Most resume templates meet these criteria. You can find some samples at www.crackingthepminterview.com.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Rule #5: Don’t Skip the Best Stuff</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">In theory, this is obvious. Of course you shouldn’t leave the best stuff off your resume!</p><p class="calibre_1">In practice though, many candidates ignore this final rule. They leave something out because they didn’t feel it was “appropriate” for a resume for &lt;insert strange reason&gt;. This is so common and so important that we’ve listed it as a rule.</p><p class="calibre_1">For example, Jessica, a product manager at Amazon, was applying for other PM jobs at Amazon and other companies. After multiple rounds of resume editing and feedback, her resume was almost perfect—except for one detail. She’d neglected to mention that she had, on the side, launched a gaming company, hired multiple developers and designers, and overseen the development of a game. The combination of this entrepreneurial effort and the Amazon job are basically her golden ticket into any PM interview.</p><p class="calibre_1">Why didn’t she include it? Because, due to some medical problems, she hadn’t yet launched the game. She figured that you couldn’t list it until you were “done.”</p><p class="calibre_1">In similar situations, other people have given a variety of reasons: “It was for a class.” “It wasn’t an official class project.” “We haven’t finished yet.” “We didn’t get many downloads.”</p><p class="calibre_1">None of these reasons are sufficient to exclude something from your resume. If it helps you, list it.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Implementing This Rule</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Ask yourself: what did you <span class="italic">not</span> include? Are there projects you’ve done (on your own, for school, for a friend’s company, for a hackathon, etc.) that you haven’t listed? Any relevant hobbies? Or interests which have some interesting accomplishment (e.g., completing a triathlon)?</p><p class="calibre_1">There are no hard and fast rules about what belongs on your resume and what doesn’t. If it makes you a more interesting or more attractive candidate, include it.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_53"></div>
