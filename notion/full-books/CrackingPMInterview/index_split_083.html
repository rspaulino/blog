In fact, in many ways preparing for behavioral questions is probably the best “bang for your buck.” You know you’ll be asked behavioral questions and, with proper preparation, you really can master these questions.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Step 1: Create a Preparation Grid</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">A preparation grid helps you map your experience to the common behavioral questions.

In the rows, you list the major categories for behavioral questions: leadership / influence, teamwork, successes, challenges, and mistakes / failures. Then, fill in each cell with one to three stories.</p><p class="calibre_1">Creating such a grid will make it easy for you to come up with an answer to a very specific question. When your interviewer asks you a question like, “Tell me about a time when you dealt with a hostile coworker.” or, “How did you show leadership at your last company?” you’ll have a story on hand to deliver.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Step 2: Master Five Key Stories</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">The cells above have lots of stories, but what you want to master is five key stories that best represent why you’re a great PM candidate. These are the stories that you’ll try to fit in whenever you have a chance. This is where you get to show off your wow-factor.</p><p class="calibre_1">When you identify the five key stories from your past, ask yourself the following questions.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Is each story substantial?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Each of your stories should have a substantial situation, action, and result. Most often, stories flop in the “action” part.</p><p class="calibre_1">Consider this story which I rehearsed with one candidate:</p><blockquote class="calibre_23"><span class="italic">My team had just launched a new feature for updating your profile from the mobile app. Everything seemed to go well at first. But then, several users began complaining they were getting spammed.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">I gathered the developers together and asked them to focus on figuring out if this was our fault. It turns out the process of updating their profiles had inadvertently changed their privacy settings.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">The developers were able to remedy the situation. They reverted to old privacy settings and rolled out a fix.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">I then drafted an email to the users explaining the situation and our remedy. The users were happy with our resolution and the issue hasn’t come up again.</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_19">When the candidate got to the end of this story, I nodded and said, “So you basically just wrote an email, right?”</p><p class="calibre_1">“Well, yes,” the candidate told me. “But it could have been a really big problem if we hadn’t fixed it so quickly.”</p><p class="calibre_1">She’s right; it <span class="italic">could</span> have been. It was the developers who tracked down the problem. All this candidate really did was write an email apologizing. That’s not substantial.</p><p class="calibre_1">Make sure each of your stories has a “meaty” situation, action, and result. Rehearse your story with someone and have them parrot back to you the gist of these three components.</p><p class="calibre_1">Many stories that flop initially can be salvaged. For example, if this candidate had pulled together a new process to prevent these situations from occurring again, then that could well make a good story.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Is each story understandable?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Even a story with a great situation, action, and result will flop if it’s too complicated. Your interviewer will wind up lost in the details about who did what and be unable to grasp the essential parts: what <span class="italic">you</span> did.</p><p class="calibre_1">Of course, a good part of making stories understandable is how you deliver them. You need to understand what the gist is of each story so you can offer up just the relevant bits.</p><p class="calibre_1">If you’ve stripped the story down to just the essentials and still find yourself explaining a lot of details, it might be time to kill the story. This is especially common with stories requiring technical, product, or mathematical knowledge.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">What does each story say about you?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">A story you give your interviewer shouldn’t just answer the question; it should communicate something to your interviewer about you or how you work. When you review a potential story, ask yourself: what does this say about me?</p><p class="calibre_1">For example, take the following story:</p><blockquote class="calibre_23"><span class="italic">At my last company, I identified a way that we could, with a few tweaks, support a new market segment—startups. However, the CEO was reluctant to pursue this opportunity, explaining that he was worried about the additional development time and wasn’t sure this new market would be lucrative. He just didn’t want to take the risk for so little return.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">Rather than give up, I met with one of the key software architects to develop a plan to test out these new tweaks. We were able to reduce the development plan for a minimum viable product from six weeks to just two. We also worked out a way to minimize the effort required to support the market, reducing the marketing, testing, and support costs.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">I also researched the market more thoroughly. I explored what other solutions that market had and got a feel for how our product would compare to the other options. I then searched our customer base and found that about 5% of our customers were actually enterprise customers.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">When I re-approached the CEO, I had a considerably less risky proposal. We could spend just two weeks of development costs and roll out this new version to just the existing enterprise customers. This would reduce our marketing costs to nearly zero, at least until we knew if we definitely wanted to go ahead and pursue it. And since we’re not rolling out a new product to new users, it’s easy for us to revert the changes.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">The CEO agreed to this plan as a way to explore this opportunity with the new market segment. It ended up being very successful—in fact, it increased user spend by 20% for those users. This new market now accounts for about 15% of our total revenue.</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_19">This candidate has shown that she is:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Creative:</span> She identified a new market segment.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Ambitious:</span> She pursued an idea when others might have been discouraged</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Understanding:</span> She understood what the CEO’s concerns were and found ways to resolve them, rather than just arguing that he was wrong.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Data Driven / Analytical:</span> She gathered data to support her pitch.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Scrappy:</span> She found ways to reduce costs and analyze a market at minimal risk to the company.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">You could even approach it from the other direction. What do you want to show about yourself, and how can you communicate that through examples?</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">Are you creative?</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29">Are you well liked within your company?</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29">Are you good at building teams and energizing people?</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29">Are you understanding and empathetic?</li><li value="5" class="calibre_29">Are you a good leader?</li><li value="6" class="calibre_29">Are you analytical?</li><li value="7" class="calibre_29">Are you determined and ambitious?</li><li value="8" class="calibre_29">Are you a risk taker?</li><li value="9" class="calibre_29">Are you good at minimizing risk?</li><li value="10" class="calibre_29">Are you technical?</li><li value="11" class="calibre_29">Are you good at influencing others?</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">Each of these areas could be part of a new story.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Is it really about you?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">A good product manager is all about putting her team first.</p><p class="calibre_1">This is a good thing to do in general, but many take it too far in interviews. Listen to the way you tell your story. If you find yourself constantly saying “we” and “us” instead of “I” and “me,” you might want to tweak your wording—or find a new story entirely.</p><p class="calibre_1">These stories should be about your successes and failures, not your team’s. Your team is of course a key part of those (either enabling or feeling the impact of them), but it’s still about how your actions contributed to those. For example, if your team pivoted, you should discuss what you did to lead your team through that pivot.</p><p class="calibre_1">The actions should be your actions, but the results should be felt by the team or your customers.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Do you “get” other people?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Understanding other people is a fundamental part of teamwork, leadership, and persuasion, and therefore a fundamental part of a product management role. Your stories should show that you “get” other people.</p><p class="calibre_1">Unfortunately, sometimes a candidate’s stories reveal that she lacks insight into other people. This commonly happens when a candidate:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Bad mouths other people:</span> Yes, we all know some people can be frustrating to work with, but an interview is not the time to dive into this. If you rant about a coworker, your interviewer is likely to wonder if the issue was really that <span class="italic">you</span> are hard to work with. Many companies won’t want to roll the dice there. Instead of complaining about the other people in the story, address their motivations. You might say, “The other PM was trying to optimize for immediate revenue” rather than “he was an idiot.”</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Shows helplessness:</span> Failure is okay; helplessness is not. If you weren’t able to convince other people of something, explain why—without casting blame. For example, you might say, “the executives and I decided that while my proposal was exciting, changing course so late in the project introduced too much risk.”</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">Empathy is an important part of any PM role, and these stories need to demonstrate that—or at least not demonstrate the opposite.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Do your stories have good coverage and good flexibility?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Behavioral questions tend to fall into one of five areas, so you’ll want to make sure that you have good coverage of these topics across your five key stories. These common topics are:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">Leadership &amp; Influence</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29">Challenges</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29">Mistakes / failures</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29">Successes</li><li value="5" class="calibre_29">Teamwork</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">You should have at least one story per topic.</p><p class="calibre_1">Ideally, several of your stories will fall under two or more categories. This is valuable because you don’t know what you’ll be asked. What if you’re asked multiple questions on challenges? Or what if a question doesn’t cleanly fit into any topic? You might find that you’ve already used your “challenge” story for a question like “Tell me about a time when you led a team through something difficult”—only to get a question that explicitly calls for leadership.</p><p class="calibre_1">By ensuring your stories have both good coverage and good flexibility, you’ll be able to prevent getting caught off-guard with specific behavioral questions.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Step 3: Practice</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">You know that you’ll be asked a variety of behavioral questions, so there’s no excuse for not being well prepared for these questions. If possible, grab a friend to listen through your stories. Ask your friend to then repeat back what he understood the gist of the situation, action, and result to be. Did each part sound substantial to you and him? If he struggles to understand what your story is about, then your interviewer will likely as well. That means it’s time to pick a new story or refine your current one.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_83"></div>
