<p id="filepos289556" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Attributes of a Good PM Resume</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">Employers want PMs who have technical skills, love technology, possess initiative, are leaders, and will have an impact. A resume is a chance to showcase these parts of your background.</p><p class="calibre_1">It’s more than that though. A resume is itself a product. It makes a statement about your communication skills, design skills, and your ability to put yourself in the “user’s shoes.”</p><p class="calibre_1">Think about your audience: What do they care about and how will you demonstrate that you have those things? For example, if you work for a company that’s not well known, can you concisely describe what the company is on the resume? Is there a way you can establish credibility, such as mentioning who funded the company? This is your chance to show off your “product design” skills.</p><p class="calibre_1">For many PM positions, it will be important to demonstrate these skills:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Passion for Technology:</span> If you have technical skills or have worked at a tech company, this will probably show enough passion for technology. If you don’t have these things, find some other way to get involved with technology. You could start learning to code through online courses, build your own website, or even outsource development of a project.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Initiative:</span> You could show initiative through a club at your university, a new employee training program at your startup, or even a monthly dinner for people interested in technology. Show these experiences on your resume.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Leadership:</span> If you’ve managed people in some capacity, show this. This experience could include mentoring / managing an intern or being the president of a club or organization.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Impact:</span> Show that you’ve had a positive impact in your prior roles. Be clear about what you’ve personally driven, since your team’s accomplishments are much less relevant than your own. Explicitly state what you’ve built, created, led, or implemented. Avoid weak phrases such as “worked with” and “helped with.”</li><li value="5" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Technical Skills:</span> If you have programming skills, list these programming languages in a “technical skills” section. This will suggest some degree of proficiency. Ideally you will also have specific projects to list.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Attention to Detail:</span> This is more about what you don’t do than what you do. No spelling or grammar mistakes. Consistency in ending bullets with periods (periods are optional, but you need to be consistent). Correct contact information.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">Go through your resume and look for signs of each of these attributes. If you’re missing some of these attributes or skills, find ways to acquire them and then add them to your resume.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_54"></div>
