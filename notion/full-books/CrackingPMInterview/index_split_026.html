<p id="filepos129091" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">New Grads</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">Product management is a great role to get into right out of college. Many of the big companies have university recruiting programs, and they pride themselves on training new grads to become top notch product managers. In many ways, it’s easier to get into product management as a new grad than as an experienced candidate.</p><p class="calibre_1">The new grad product management programs only accept a small percentage of the many applicants they get each year. If you want to stand out from the crowd, you will need to show strong technical skills combined with excellent customer focus and product design skills. Generally, it won’t be enough to just ace all of your engineering classes, since that might still land your resume in the Software Engineer pile.</p><p class="calibre_1">If you’re a current student and want to improve your chances of getting hired as a product manager, consider the following:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold">Major in computer science, or at least get a minor in computer science or a closely related field.</span></span><span class="calibre6"> College recruiters often only consider candidates with a very technical background.</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre_25"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold">Pick up a double major, especially in a field like economics or business.</span></span><span class="calibre6"> A computer science / economics double major is a very common background for product managers because it shows an interest in both the technical and business side of software. Econ is also a great field for picking up analytical skills and proficiency with statistics. Other fields like psychology, philosophy, cognitive science, human-computer interaction (HCI), or sociology can also be very relevant for product management.</span></li><li value="3" class="calibre_25"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold">Take group project courses.</span></span><span class="calibre6"> Group project courses are a great way to pick up leadership skills and start to gain relevant experience. Pay attention to the group dynamics and the challenges your group overcomes. You can use those experiences as anecdotes during your interview to answer behavioral questions.</span></li><li value="4" class="calibre_25"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold">Take on a leadership role.</span></span><span class="calibre6"> This can be on anything from a sports team to a club to class president. As a product manager you’ll need very strong leadership skills to lead a team of engineers. It’s especially great if you can do something from scratch, like launch a new club, a school-wide contest, or an extracurricular activity. This shows initiative.</span></li><li value="5" class="calibre_26"><blockquote class="calibre_27"><span class="italic">Should you intern as a developer or a PM?</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_28"><span class="calibre6">You don’t have to be an engineer before you can apply to be a product manager. But if you love coding and want to buff up your technical credentials, an engineering internship gives you a great chance to see the PM-Dev relationship from the other side. Many engineers love working with PMs who used to be engineers.</span></blockquote></li><li value="6" class="calibre_18"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold">Start a side project.</span></span><span class="calibre6"> One of the best ways to rise above the crowd is to have a side project like a mobile app. This gives you a chance to show your customer focus and product design skills. If you don’t have the technical skills to do this yourself, you can learn them, hire some developers to do the building, or partner with your technical friends.</span></li><li value="7" class="calibre_25"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold">Intern as a product manager or software engineer.</span></span><span class="calibre6"> There’s nothing better than learning on the job, and an internship gives you that chance.</span></li></ul><p class="calibre_1">The key theme here is to show something beyond coding skills. Coding skills are great—often required, in fact—but they’re not sufficient. Find a way to show leadership, business skills, and initiative.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_26"></div>
