</span></p><p class="calibre_31">Richard’s resume is actually fairly good, compared to many other resumes. However, it could still be stronger.</p><p class="calibre_1">Most importantly, Richard could make his resume more accomplishment-oriented. He should take each job and ask himself, “What are my five biggest accomplishments?” These should form the bullets of his resume.</p><p class="calibre_1">For example, look at the bullets under his most recent role. They are vague statements such as “drove product strategy” and “prioritized work.” These aren’t truly accomplishments; they’re just responsibilities worded in the past tense. Until you’ve shown an impact, it’s not really that meaningful.</p><p class="calibre_1">Additionally, Richard has many bullets under each job, making each bullet less impactful than if the list were restricted to just the highlights.</p><p class="calibre_1">If he’s doing this to take up space on his resume, he’ll need to find some other side of his background to offer. Perhaps he took on some interesting roles during his MBA or has some projects he’s done on the side.</p><p class="calibre_1">Finally, he should consider listing his programming languages under “Additional Information.” He’s got the space (once he trims down his bullets), and this list would be a good way of quickly showing an interviewer that he is very technical.</p><p class="calibre_1">With that said, here is what an improved resume might look like. We’ve offered explanations of what some of his companies do and offered more concrete accomplishments with his bullets.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">New and Improved </span></span><a id="filepos314822"></a></p><p class="calibre_30"><span class="calibre4">
