They could be introduced in a question about diagnosing a hypothetical issue, or they could be used to explain why a particular decision was made.</p><p class="calibre_1">In your discussions, be sure to consider which metrics are most important for a product. Any product will excel in some metrics and struggle at others.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Types of Metrics</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Depending on your goals, you can break down the types of metrics in a variety of ways. We’ve divided them into user acquisition, activity, conversion &amp; retention, and money.</p><p class="calibre_1">Alternatively, you can divide them based on the customer lifecycle, as Dave McClure does in his “Startup Metrics for Pirates” presentation<sup class="calibre11"><small id="filepos685014" class="calibre12"><a href="index_split_105.html#filepos762919">1</a></small></sup>: Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral, and Revenue.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">User Acquisition</span></span></p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">How many users do we have?</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29">How (and why) has the user base grown overtime?</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29">How many active users are there?

Measurements since beginning of time are neat, but not actionable. They’re the sorts of things a company might show off to investors or to the press. They won’t help the company make a decision.</p><p class="calibre_1">Many of these metrics can and should be broken down by “cohorts.” These cohorts could be based on gender, location, date registered, or a variety of other factors.</p><p class="calibre_1">To actually gather data, you have many options:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Usability Testing:</span> This generally won’t give you true metrics, but it can help you understand the why.

Like usability testing, this will generally be more powerful in offer context to understand metrics than in gathering numbers.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Traffic Analysis:</span> Tools such as Google Analytics can help companies understand how users are interacting with the website.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Internal Logs:</span> Logging information directly can help a company understand user behavior at a deeper level than simple traffic analysis.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">A/B Testing:</span> A/B Testing can help a company understand the impact of a particular change by comparing the behavior of users who have a feature to those who don’t. While it is an incredibly useful tool, it can also be misapplied. For example, rolling out a new chat feature to only a small percentage of users might give you misleading data about usage patterns. After all, I can’t use chat if none of my friends are.</li></ul><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_104"></div>
