<p id="filepos503569" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Tips and Tricks</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">Estimation questions are heavy on math. Whether you’re good at mental math or not, these tips and tricks can make your life a bit easier.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Tip: Round Numbers</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">There are times when being a perfectionist and being detail oriented is warranted, but this is not such a time. After all, you’re going to be taking so many wild guesses and “guesstimates” that a bit of hand waving in your math really won’t make a difference. You’re just trying to get your answer in the right ballpark. Absolute precision will not do you any favors.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Example</span></span></p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">The US population is 314 million (in 2012), but you should use 300 million</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29">There are 8760 hours in a year (8784 in a leap year), but using 9000 or 10,000 is probably close enough.</li></ul><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Trick: Rule of 72</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Here’s a fun and useful tip: if you need to calculate how long until something doubles, divide 72 by the percent increase.</p><p class="calibre_1">That is, an investment, population, salary or other value increasing at x% per year will double after approximately 72/x years.</p><p class="calibre_1">This rule works fairly well (being within 5 or 10% of the true answer) for smaller values of x. However, even up through a 100% annual increase (which is doubling within a year), the result is still within 30% of the actual answer.</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">x &lt; 20%: result is within 5% of actual answer.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29">x &lt; 65%: result is within 20% of actual answer.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29">x &lt; 100%: result is within 30% of actual answer.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29">x &gt; 100%: result gets increasingly less accurate. However, this means the result doubling in less than a year.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">Of course, dividing 72 by something without a calculator is generally tricky. Using 70 or 75 will make your life easier and will generally be close enough.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Example</span></span></p><p class="calibre_20"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Salary Increase</span></span></p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Interviewer:</span> “A recent college graduate makes $65,000 per year. If she gets a raise of 9% per year, how long until her original salary has doubled?”</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Candidate:</span> “We can apply the Rule of 72 here. 72 divided by 9 is 8. So it will take about 8 years.”</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Answer:</span> The precise answer would be that it takes 8.05 years for her salary to double. After 8 years, her salary would have increased by 99%. Not bad for a bit of rounding!</li></ul><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_12"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Population Growth</span></span></p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Interviewer:</span> “The 2012 census determined the US population to be about 300 million and increasing at a rate of 0.7% per year. If the rate holds steady, how long until the US population reaches 600 million?”</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Candidate:</span> “We’re basically looking for the length of time before the US population doubles, so we can apply the Rule of 72 by dividing 72 by 0.7. What is that? Well, it’s certainly going to be between 72 and 2 x 72 (since 0.7 is between 1 and 1/2). We can guess about 100 years then, which would tell us that the population will double around year 2112.”</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Answer:</span> Even with all this “loose” math, the candidate came fairly close. If he had divided 72 by 0.7, he would have gotten 103 years. The precise answer is 99.3 years. The candidate’s answer was reasonably close to both values, but even more importantly, he took a logical, quantitative approach. That’s what these problems are all about.</li></ul><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Trick: Orders of Magnitude</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">When multiplying two large numbers, it’s easy to make a mistake. This isn’t a big deal if you’re off by something in the 1s digit, but if you add an extra zero or forget a zero, you can wind up off by 10x or more. That <span class="italic">is</span> a big deal.</p><p class="calibre_1">It’s therefore useful to validate that your numbers are at least in the same order of magnitude as the expected result. One way to do this is the following: if you multiplied a and b together to get n, then the sum of the number of digits in the terms should be within one of the number of terms in the result.</p><p class="calibre_1">Or, more precisely:</p><blockquote class="calibre_23"><span class="calibre6"><tt class="calibre10">digits(a) + digits(b) = digits(a * b)</tt></span></blockquote><p class="calibre_31">Or:</p><blockquote class="calibre_23"><span class="calibre6"><tt class="calibre10">digits(a) + digits(b) = digits(a * b) + 1</tt></span></blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_31">For example, 823 * 1032 will have either 6 or 7 digits. (In actuality, it has 6 digits.) If you wind up with a number like 84936, you’ll know you’ve done something wrong.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Tip: Be Confident</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">How many times have you heard someone say, “Oh, I suck at math” or “Numbers are just not my thing”? Whether it’s true or not, an interview is not the time for such proclamations.</p><p class="calibre_1">Companies want to hire PMs who are confident—or who can at least pretend to be. Don’t let it show if you’re intimidated, and <span class="italic">definitely</span> don’t tell your interviewer that you’re bad at math. Self-deprecating comments won’t do you any favors.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Tip: Label Your Units</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Many people think of labeling units of a value (e.g., “4 meters”) as one of those pesky things that school teachers insisted on, but this habit will be invaluable here.</p><p class="calibre_1">A common mistake that candidates make is getting confused in their units. They write down “4” to indicate “4 meters,” but when it comes time to do some arithmetic, forget that it’s not in kilometers. And, unfortunately, this can be a very difficult “bug” to find.</p><p class="calibre_1">If you label all values with their units, you’ll be much better off in the long run.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Tip: Consider Your Sources</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Imagine you’re asked to compute how many bags of potato chips are sold every year. You will want to make sure you understand the different <span class="italic">sources</span> of sales. Potato chips are sold in several places:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">In stores, direct to consumers.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29">In vending machines, direct to consumers.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29">From distributors, to schools, hospitals, movie theaters, etc.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29">And many other places!</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">Multiple “sources” are common in market-sizing or revenue questions, but they can also come up in other ways.</p><p class="calibre_1">For example, suppose you were asked how many elevators were needed for a one-block long, one-block wide, 20-story building. You’ll probably chug along doing some work with the number of people in the building and how often they need to use the elevator. But have you thought about the freight elevator? That’s a “source” too!</p><p class="calibre_1">It’s okay in many cases to decide that your additional sources can be ignored, but you still want to call them out to the interviewer. This shows an attention to detail.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Tip: Keep Discrete Steps Discrete</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">The more organized you can be, the better. If your estimation question has several independent steps, you should try to compute them separately. If (or when!) you make a mistake, you’ll be able to come back to it, narrow in on the exact mistakes, and correct it with minimal hassle.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Example</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Suppose that you are computing the amount of revenue Gmail earns in ads every year. Your approach might look like the following:</p><blockquote class="calibre_23"><span class="calibre6"><tt class="calibre10">$ = [# of Gmail users] x [# clicks / user] x [$ / click]</tt></span></blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_31">When you work through this problem, you should compute each of these entirely separately. You might have a chart that looks like this:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><table valign="top" class="calibre7"><tr valign="top" class="calibre8"><td valign="top" class="calibre_40"><p class="calibre_31"><span class="bold"> $ / click  </span></p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre_40"><p class="calibre_31"><span class="bold"> # clicks / user </span></p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre_40"><p class="calibre_31"><span class="bold"> # of Gmail users </span><br class="calibre1"/></p></td></tr><tr valign="top" class="calibre8"><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_31">…<br class="calibre1"/></p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_31">…</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9"><p class="calibre_31">…<br class="calibre1"/></p></td></tr></table><p class="calibre_1">You’ll merge (or multiply) these values only in the very last step in the question.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Tip: Record Intermediate Steps</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">While some estimation questions are very short, most are fairly lengthy and require numerous calculations. It’s important that you write down what you’re doing as you’re doing it. You might need to come back to it later to correct your work or even to reuse a previously computed number.</p><p class="calibre_1">Record each step in an organized, easy-to-read fashion such that you can easily come back to any step. Think of this as “showing your work” to your math teacher. If your approach is so organized that another person could hypothetically follow it, it will be much easier for you to analyze where you might have gone wrong.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Tip: Record Your Assumptions</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">It’s not uncommon for your final answer to be wildly off. When this happens, there are two main reasons: either you made a math mistake (in which case being organized will help you locate it) or one of your assumptions was wrong.</p><p class="calibre_1">Therefore, the easier it is to identify where you made an assumption, the easier it will be to discover potential issues.</p><p class="calibre_1">Ideally, you would keep a list on the side of the page with all the assumptions you make. But, if that doesn’t work for you, at least circle each assumption as you make it. That will go a long way in letting you skim all your assumptions for issues.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_89"></div>
