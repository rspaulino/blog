<p id="filepos105292" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Twitter</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">Twitter is a rapidly growing company working on the future of communication. Since Twitter is growing so fast in terms of users and headcount, the organization is constantly changing and evolving. This growth also opens a lot of opportunities for people to move around and grow their roles.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Who they recruit</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Twitter hires people who are passionate about Twitter. They look for people who love the product, the company, or the mission.</p><p class="calibre_1">Twitter hires for two related roles: product manager (PM) and technical program manager (TPM). Product managers usually work on customer-facing teams. Technical program managers usually work on platform or infrastructure initiatives, often across multiple teams. The PM role includes more product design, while the TPM role involves more project management.</p><p class="calibre_1">For the technical program manager role, Twitter looks for people with a technical background and experience in software delivery. In addition, they look for a “get things done” mentality and excellent communication skills. Many TPMs come with program management experience, but many also come from backgrounds such as consulting, engineering management, or technical architecture.</p><p class="calibre_1">For the product manager role, Twitter looks for people with a single-minded focus on the user and who are flexible enough to handle the fast pace. Because Twitter has relatively few PMs per engineer, they usually hire more experienced candidates who can keep up with the work.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">What they do</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Product managers at Twitter wear a bunch of hats. Teams are made up of product, engineering, and design. PMs are involved in concepts and roadmapping as well as finding bugs, prioritizing features, executing on current projects, and thinking about the future. The PM serves as the interface between the feature area and the rest of the company.</p><p class="calibre_1">The technical program manager role is relatively new at Twitter and in some ways is still being defined. There are several different types of TPMs, and Twitter is building career paths for all of them.</p><p class="calibre_1">Some TPMs are responsible for release management: shepherding the web and mobile releases, making sure the builds get in, running the dogfooding process (where Twitter employees try out the new builds), and making sure bugs get fixed.</p><p class="calibre_1">Other TPMs manage broad programs across many teams with hundreds of people including external people across companies. Other TPMs are thought leaders on cross-team topics like the Agile process. Still other TPMs are embedded in a single platform or infrastructure team.</p><p class="calibre_1">Ideas at Twitter come from all over the company: management, PMs, engineers, designers, and people in other roles like user services. One way Twitter supports this is with a quarterly hack week where people can work on whatever they want as long as it’s related to Twitter. Many great ideas come out of hack week, and people can use the time to build buzz around their ideas.</p><p class="calibre_1">Planning at Twitter happens quarterly, and teams are responsible for their own goals (called “gulls,” since Twitter likes to name things after birds). During implementation, teams constantly dogfood (try new features out internally) and present what they’re working on through weekly meetings.</p><p class="calibre_1">The company runs many A/B tests and is data driven. However, it is also careful about being too data driven. Teams use the metrics to understand how things are performing against success metrics and then make changes as necessary, but they still make sure they move quickly and keep the spirit of the product intact.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_23"></div>
