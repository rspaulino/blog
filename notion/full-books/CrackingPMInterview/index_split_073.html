<p id="filepos401016" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">“Why do you want to work here?”</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">When I interviewed candidates at Google, I would ask them why they were interested in the position. Many answers would be something along the lines of:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">Because I’ve heard Google has a great culture.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29">Because Google has changed the world.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29">Because so many people use Google products, and I want to work on something my family and friends have used.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">These answers are okay, but they’re just okay. You won’t win any points delivering an answer like that. Why? Because you haven’t given me anything that makes me want to hire you more.</p><p class="calibre_1">An ideal answer will sell yourself in some way. Consider integrating one or more of these aspects into your answer:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Company Research:</span> You can use your answer to show that you’ve done research about the company or position. Doing research shows passion for the position, and passionate employees make good employees. For example, you might say, “What piqued my interest was a presentation your lead UI designer made about the different methods you use for data analysis, and how this helps you build a better product. I’m very quantitative, so I really want to work for such a data-driven company.”</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Relevant Experience:</span> Your answer can actually communicate to the interviewer directly that you have relevant skills or experience. For example, you could say something like this: “I’m really interested in testing tools. For my senior project in college, I built an automated way of detecting certain types of errors. I learned a ton about different types of website errors and ways to detect them. I was really intrigued by how much impact automated testing can do, if done well—but I also learned just how challenging it is to do well. I’m excited to get back into this space and leverage what I learned.”</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Passion:</span> It can be valuable to directly communicate passion for a position. This is especially true for startups that are focused on some sort of “greater good” for the world. For example, for an education-related startup, it could be good to have an explanation like this: “I grew up fairly poor and attended pretty mediocre elementary schools. What helped me excel beyond my peers and win a scholarship to a top high school and college was seeking out extra resources. At that time, this meant public libraries, mentors, and a small number of websites. I think your company has the potential to bring these online resources to a much broader community of disadvantaged students. This was so meaningful to me growing up that I really want to be a part of that now.”</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">In general, big companies will be less impressed by your having researched the company or being really passionate about working for them. They presume, for better or worse, that you want to work for them. It’s better to show a passion for the role/team, or some experience that makes you a good fit. Avoid answers about it being a good stepping stone for your career or a nice name for a resume. Those answers might make your interviewer think you’re not going to stick around for long.</p><p class="calibre_1">At a startup, passion for the company or expertise in the space can be really important. You should use the company’s product and have an opinion about it. Avoid answers about wanting the “financial upside” of a startup. That doesn’t make you a better candidate; it just means you like money. It also means you might be unrealistic about the hardships of a startup or that you might leave the second things get rough.</p><p class="calibre_1">Try to come up with two or three reasons prior to your interview. And, of course, practice your answer.</p><p class="calibre_1">If you’re asked this question by multiple interviewers, it’s okay to give a very similar answer to each. In fact, it might be strange if you didn’t offer similar reasons.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_73"></div>
