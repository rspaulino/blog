The side project gives you a chance to gain experience shipping a product, builds up your resume, shows off your technical skills, shows off your product design skills, and gives you a lot to talk about during your interview. If you hired people to help you, it might also give you a chance to show leadership skills.</p><p class="calibre_1">A good side project has the following qualities:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold">Fills in the gaps in your experience.</span></span><span class="calibre6"> For example, if you don’t have a computer science degree, you can show off your technical skills by building a website or mobile app. There are many tutorials online that you can follow to build a simple app for free.</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre_25"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold">Shows off your skills.</span></span><span class="calibre6"> If you’ve got great visual design or savvy business sense, the side project can be a great place to show it off.</span></li><li value="3" class="calibre_25"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold">Is something you can speak passionately about.</span></span><span class="calibre6"> Are you solving an important problem? Or did you get to test out some interesting hypotheses? Did you learn a new technology? Make sure you can tell a story about your project.</span></li></ul><p class="calibre_1">If you’re not technical, you have a few options. You can recruit friends to help you with implementation. You can hire people to build it. You can also make your side project about discovering the feasibility of an idea. For example, you can design the product and create a marketing website that describes it and asks people to sign up to be notified when it’s available. You could then iterate on the product idea and see how that affects the sign-up rate.</p><p class="calibre_1">Another good non-technical option is a design and usability project. Pick a problem in the world or your local community and start talking to people, observing them, and coming up with ideas. Then build a paper prototype and test it out with people - bring it to a coffee shop and ask people if they’ll try it out. IDEO, a top design firm, has materials on Human-Centered Design on their website that can help you learn more about running these projects.</p><p class="calibre_1">When you choose your side project, be aware that interviewers will often ask you a lot of questions about it, so be honest about the motivations for the side project and how far you went with it. It’s perfectly reasonable to build a mobile app to brush up on your technical skills, to get experience launching a product, or to try out some new design paradigms. In fact, those are great reasons; they show a passion for learning and experimenting.</p><p class="calibre_1">Be prepared to talk about how you would improve the project if you were to continue working on it, why you made the choices that you did, and how it was and wasn’t successful. If you have any positive metrics (user signups, revenue per user, etc.), these are good to discuss.</p><p class="calibre_1">Your side project should be listed on your resume as well as on your website, if you have one. It’s great if your side projects were successful, but just having done something shows a lot. Don’t be afraid to list “unsuccessful” side projects.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_33"></div>
