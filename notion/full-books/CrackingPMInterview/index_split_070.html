<p id="filepos387751" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">The Questions</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">With all the research behind you, it’s wise to walk into an interview prepped with questions to ask the interviewer. Almost every interviewer will give you an opportunity to ask them questions, and you don’t want to enter that “awkward silence” phase.</p><p class="calibre_1">You can think about questions as falling into a few major categories:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Useful Questions:</span> The “Do you have any questions for me?” moment is, of course, a useful time to get some things answered about the role or company. It can be particularly valuable to ask a question where the answer might vary across interviewers. For example, “What do you find most challenging about being a PM here?”</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Passion Questions:</span> Some questions show a passion for the company or role, simply because you had the background or desire to ask the question. For instance, asking a company why they dropped their initial monetization strategy shows you’ve researched the company, and asking a question such as, “Where do you see the company going in five years?” shows the drive to understand the company.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Expertise Questions:</span> Other questions do more than just show research; they can show a deep understand of the company’s business. For example, the following question shows an understanding of international markets: “If it’s something you can share, I’d love to learn more about why your company decided to enter Europe before Asia. Given the regulatory issues in Europe and the smaller market size, Asia would seem like a more natural pick.”</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">In addition to these general types of questions, some questions work well in many interviews. Some good questions include:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">What’s a typical day like for you? How much of your day do you spend writing specs versus working with designers versus doing other activities?</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29">How has the role of a PM changed? How do you see it changing?</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29">What is the balance between PMs, developers, and designers? How does decision making work?</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29">What’s your favorite part about working here?</li><li value="5" class="calibre_29">What would make someone the ideal PM candidate for you?</li><li value="6" class="calibre_29">What do you think makes this company’s culture unique?</li><li value="7" class="calibre_29">What do you find most challenging about being a PM here?</li><li value="8" class="calibre_29">Who do you work with on your core team versus extended team?</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">Don’t underestimate the importance of questions for your interviewer. Many candidates find their interviewer leaves a ton of time for questions, and they just don’t have enough questions to ask the interviewer.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">What Not to Ask</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Do not ask questions that are:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Red flags:</span> For example, asking about vacation time in an interview can come off the wrong way. Just how much vacation are you planning on taking?</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Obvious:</span> Asking a question with obvious answers suggests you haven’t done your homework and you may not be very serious about the role. For example, a question such as, “What’s the monetization strategy?” might, in many cases, reveal a lack of preparation.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Critical:</span> A question like “Why didn’t you do _____?” can sometimes come off as negative, or as an I-want-to-prove-I’m-smart question. Such questions can also just be annoying, particularly when the answer is likely to be some version of “too many features, too little time.”</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">If you’re worried a question might reflect poorly on you, you can always ask it after you have an offer.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_70"></div>
