To give you a sense of what kind of improvements you can make, we’re sharing examples of the real resumes that landed these jobs, along with examples of how they could be made even better.</p><blockquote class="calibre_23">Note: The “before” resumes shown here match what the candidate submitted to get a PM role, although they have been anonymized in some cases. Anonymizing resumes involved changing names and key details, but keeping the facts roughly equivalent. For example, rather than saying that a candidate went to Columbia University, we might instead say Cornell University.</blockquote><p class="calibre_22"></p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_56"></div>
