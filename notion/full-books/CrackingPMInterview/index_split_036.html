<p id="filepos191642" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Q &amp; A: Fernando Delgado, Sr. Director, Product Management at Yahoo</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">How did you make such a big jump from being a product manager at Google to being a senior director at Yahoo?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">I decided to move to Yahoo relatively early after Marissa joined as CEO. I was taking a big of leap of faith. I think joining so early, when it was risky, helped me personally figure out a role I was excited about and gave me a bit of leverage.</p><p class="calibre_1">In large companies, it’s really hard to make big jumps if you stay in the same company. They have really set ways about how they do promotions. There are people who are put on the fast track, but they still have to go step by step. If companies didn’t do it that way, there’d be lots of upset people.</p><p class="calibre_1">It’s pretty obvious to me that, in big companies, the only way to make big jumps is to jump to another one. You get a big reward if you take a lot of risk. You can go to a startup. Or you find a very unique opportunity like I had, where a large company gets a new CEO and is willing to look at things with a new lens.</p><p class="calibre_1">This might cause you to conclude that the only way to make big jumps is switching every year or two, but that’s not what I’d advocate. You want to become an expert in certain areas and be given the opportunity to get these chances. If a company sees that someone’s never been with the same company for more than 18 months, you’ll assume it will be the same for them and they won’t want to make an investment. So stay a good few years before you make those jumps.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">What were some of the key breakthrough moments in your career?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">When I went to work on Google Maps in Zurich. That was a breakthrough moment for me. In my first year as an APM, I worked on Google web-search quality. When I moved to Maps, one of my first assignments was search quality on Maps.</p><p class="calibre_1">There were some ideas and frameworks that were working well on web search, but they weren’t being used much in Maps yet. That meant that I could bring in some of the lessons from web search to Maps—some of the things that we knew worked.</p><p class="calibre_1">I was able to work in a product that’s the most successful in its industry [Google Search] and take lessons I learned there to another product. Because I had first-hand experience with the ways a cutting-edge team did things, I had value to bring to a different product. I brought a new rigor and emphasis on techniques that ended up being successful in a new product. Some things were different of course, but at the end of the day, the fundamental ideas were the same and they worked well.</p><p class="calibre_1">Another part of this was that I moved to Zurich. A lot of people in the Zurich office hadn’t had a chance to experience how web search did things in person. I brought a new perspective that most people hadn’t encountered. This allowed me to have credibility with the engineers there.</p><p class="calibre_1">At some point, you become well versed. You have exposure and see the patterns, and this helps you do things better and better every time. It gives you a leg up in your career. In Zurich, I had the self-realization that even though the product roles are different, there’s value in bringing over lessons from other places, especially if you’ve had an opportunity to work on a leading team.</p><p class="calibre_1">Another example of this: Facebook and Twitter have been really successful at having and nurturing growth teams. Some of that culture has started to have an impact on and show the way for startups. PMs who have worked on product growth have skills that would be applicable. Even though growing from zero users to five million users is different than growing from 10 million users to 50 million users, a lot of the general lessons can be applied.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">What advice would you give to a PM who wants to advance in their career?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">It’s important to realize that, in a lot of PM roles, you get to a tipping point, after which making decisions and working with a team become a lot easier. Things flow more naturally. You get less cynicism and skepticism from engineers, and it enables a friendlier environment.</p><p class="calibre_1">Reaching that tipping point should be a big thought when you start a new role. Circumstances can make it easier or harder. Currently, I’m leading mobile development for the Yahoo mobile app for iPhone and Android. The team started as a designer and myself and has grown significantly. I assembled my team and that got me past the tipping point and made a lot of things easier.</p><p class="calibre_1">I’ve been in projects where I felt like I could not get past that tipping point. The decision at that point was to move on to a new project. On the Android Market team, there were a lot of difficulties in terms of strong opinionated leadership, but no single clear leader. The consequence of having such team structure was making compromised decisions, often picking the wrong tradeoffs. Individual engineers could see this happening, which made it difficult for me as a PM to get past the tipping point.</p><p class="calibre_1">Larry, the CEO, tried to get teams to have a single decision maker at the top, but on my team that figure wasn’t well identified. A lot of the engineering leadership had strong product opinions, which can be fine, but I’m also strongly opinionated. Working on the team involved clashes that were hard to resolve without conflict.</p><p class="calibre_1">Android was a very successful product, and people had a culture of working really hard. I felt like because of the structure of the team, not everyone could get rewarded for their work. This coincided with my first daughter being born. I was spending a lot of time at work in an intense environment and was not getting rewarded for it.</p><p class="calibre_1">I saw I wasn’t going to go past the tipping point because other people had been with the team longer than I had. When push came to shove, they got their way. I was coming home from work frustrated. When I joined Android we had 50 million users and we grew to 350 million users while I was there. This was something to be really proud of—to contribute to this great, successful product, which was growing exponentially. But I was sacrificing my work/personal balance with no clear path. So I decided to switch teams.</p><p class="calibre_1">I’ve been more conscious about figuring out the tipping point and how to pass it. Some factors are in your control, and some are out of your control. Pick a place where you can stay long enough that you’ve been on the team longer than most people. Think about how long you’re willing to stick with a product. You cannot speed up time, but you can choose a place where you’re more likely to become a senior member of the team.</p><p class="calibre_1">As an early tip, be as much of an observer as you can. Don’t try to disrupt or change things too much early on. You’ll come to a product and have your conceptions of what needs to change, but most times there’s a culture of making decisions and reasons for why things haven’t been high priority in the past. You don’t want to pull the trigger too quickly.</p><p class="calibre_1">Understand the context of things. Be more inquisitive. Instead of telling people what to do or trying to make decisions, try to ask questions. Why is this the way it is? Try to understand the context and history instead of being the new dictator of the team.</p><p class="calibre_1">Another tip to get that tipping point early on is to demonstrate value to people. Make it so the fact that you’re there is driving something that wouldn’t happen if you weren’t there. There’s often administrative or boring work that isn’t getting done. People agree that it should get done and has value; it just isn’t at the top of anyone’s list.</p><p class="calibre_1">For example, let’s say you’re working on a news product and you need to show the logo of the news sources. Currently it’s a manual process to pick up the logo, so offer to do this for them. Find a scalable way to do it, maybe scraping, maybe using Amazon Mechanical Turk. Remove busy administrative or boring work from people, but make sure it’s in a way that actually adds value to the product.</p><p class="calibre_1">Another tip for more senior PMs: Figure out your own framework and principles for how you make decisions, and communicate that as often as you can. You start developing these frameworks, but sometimes they’re not obvious to people around you.</p><p class="calibre_1">Make it clear to the people around you why you’re making a particular decision so they see that you’re consistent with your decisions. There’s nothing engineers hate more than subjective decisions that change from one day to another. If you develop that framework and those principles, it helps people realize that you are consistent.</p><p class="calibre_1">As an example, Adam Cahan, the Senior VP of the mobile org, has an incredible eye for animations and transitions on mobile. Every time you bring him a new build of the app, he might notice that one of the transitions is inconsistent. He doesn’t have a strong opinion on how you do transitions, but he cares that, once you pick a metaphor or general mental model of the app, you stick with it.</p><p class="calibre_1">If you pick transitions where you get a sense of depth and go deeper and deeper, that’s fine, but then never violate that principle when you open a settings pane. Take the metaphor for your app and use it across the board.</p><p class="calibre_1">When you come to him with a fancy animation for something and he tells you not to do it, you might feel resistant at first. But because he’s communicated his principles so clearly, you realize that he has a good reason.</p><p class="calibre_1">Another example is that I try to make sure that, as much as possible, when you open the mobile app, you get straight to the value with as few bumps as possible. So if we’re adding a feature that won’t be used by everyone, we avoid welcome screens and tutorials. My position is always: don’t show it up front. You can educate people, but don’t put the bump up front.</p><p class="calibre_1">Over time we realized that if you stick to that principle, you find other ways of doing things. So, we have shortcuts for power users. But we’ll only show in-app hints and popups if we know for sure that you’re interested in the feature. We wait until you used a feature in the non-shortcut way and used it enough that our popup hint about the shortcut will make sense to you.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_36"></div>
