<p id="filepos89483" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Apple</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">Apple has a top-down, siloed structure. The product direction is tightly controlled by the executive team and designers, while the rest of the company executes that vision like a well-oiled machine. At Apple, engineering project managers and engineering program managers (EPMs) are the leaders of the product who keep that machine running.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Who they recruit</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Apple looks for people who live and breathe Apple products. While many companies take pride in supporting a healthy work/life balance, Apple looks for people so passionate about the end product that it is their life.</p><p class="calibre_1">For the EPM role, they’re generally looking for someone with a strong background in science and math (so that he can “figure things out”) and with a good demeanor (so that he comes across appropriately confident). Also, they want someone who’s technically fluent enough to be part of the discussion, but who won’t necessarily try to do any of the engineers’ job for them.</p><p class="calibre_1">Since Apple has many hardware projects, they hire for hardware EPMs and system EPMs, in addition to software EPMs. Software EPMs generally have a background in computer science, while hardware EPMs may have a background in another engineering field like electrical engineering or mechanical engineering.</p><p class="calibre_1">EPMs at Apple come from all levels of experience, from new college graduates to people with 15 years of industry experience. Most EPMs come to Apple from engineering school or engineering roles rather than from business/management degrees, MBAs, or former EPM positions at other companies.</p><p class="calibre_1">Apple also has a product marketing manager role, which they sometimes call product manager. For product marketing manager, they look for people with a background in business or marketing. MBA graduates are often hired into this role.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">What they do</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Early ideas at Apple can come from the top down or from the bottom up and are shaped over a series of reviews with the executive team or senior management, driven by EPMs. Product managers do customer research and look at market trends to identify strategic areas for the next release. Once the product is approved, the EPM leads the engineering teams to build the product, creating development schedules, facilitating cross-functional communication, and spearheading issues as they arise.</p><p class="calibre_1">Products at Apple involve coordination across many teams, and the EPMs are the hub of that communication, making sure things are running on schedule and solving problems when they’re not. For example, building a hardware device involves coordinating work across mechanical design teams, electrical design teams, external contract manufacturers, and operations teams.</p><p class="calibre_1">A typical day for an EPM in Cupertino involves a lot of communication: presenting the team’s progress, learning about the status of other teams, and reviewing the current status with executives. Throughout these discussions, the EPM is responsible for surfacing issues and finding ways to resolve them.</p><p class="calibre_1">For software EPMs, a big part of the day is testing the daily builds, finding blocking issues, and making sure they get fixed in a timely manner.</p><p class="calibre_1">System EPMs focus on delivering the whole product. They plan and lead prototype builds that dozens of Apple engineers travel overseas for. In addition to being the face of the Apple engineering team at contract manufacturers, the system EPM is responsible for cooperatively driving failure analysis to closure, reconciling development hardware demands, and removing obstacles that block prototype builds. The system EPM is the leader of the project within Apple and pulls together other EPMs and engineers to deliver a product.</p><p class="calibre_1">Hardware EPMs focus on the hardware deliverables for a product, including circuit boards and flexes. They work hand in hand with electrical engineering teams, product design teams, silicon teams, and external vendors. Day to day, they are involved in silicon planning and supply-chain management, and they are often tasked with reaching consensus on difficult cross-functional design decisions.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_19"></div>
