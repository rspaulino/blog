<p id="filepos71261" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">How the PM Role Varies</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">We talked to PMs from Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and numerous startups to learn what the product manager role is like at each company and what makes the company unique.</p><p class="calibre_1">We learned that the companies vary on factors like transparency between divisions, work-life balance, and how much they value candidates with technical background versus business degrees. The PM role also varies in scope, in terms of how much the job involves product definition, design work, strategy, and project management.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Transparency</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Some companies, such as Google, Facebook, and Yahoo, are very transparent, with lots of visibility into what other teams are working on. Others, such as Apple and Amazon, are more siloed, with each team focused on their own work.</p><p class="calibre_1">At the more transparent companies, you’ll frequently see PMs move between teams, and cross-team collaboration is a big part of the PM’s job. At the more siloed companies, there’s less movement and usually less of the high-pressure, cross-team work.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Ratio of PMs to Engineers</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">The ratio of PMs to engineers can also vary widely. Microsoft has many PMs, with the ratio in some teams as high as 1:3. At other companies, a ratio of 1:10 is more common. Google and Twitter are known for having very few PMs per engineer. The ratio has a big impact on how closely involved a PM is in the day-to-day work of the engineers and how large a product she’s responsible for.</p><p class="calibre_1">At a company with lots of PMs, there is a lot of collaborative work and there are many chances to learn from people with more experience. At a company with few PMs, there is a greater chance for ownership of a large area and for independent work.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Product Strategy</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">A PM’s role in defining product strategy differs between companies. At some companies, the strategy is “bottom up,” where key decisions often come from developers and PMs. At other companies, the strategy is more “top down,” where the direction is generally decided by executives and PMs, and developers are left to implement it.</p><p class="calibre_1">At Google, Facebook, Yahoo, and Amazon, product managers are deeply involved in product strategy, deciding which direction to take the product and when to start new initiatives. PMs are expected to think about strategy for their teams, for example, which customers and areas to focus on. They’ll get advice and opinions from lots of people, but ultimately they need to present a compelling plan. Often, PMs at these companies can easily get an engineering team to build out ideas at least to the experimentation stage, not needing executive approval for launches until later.</p><p class="calibre_1">Meanwhile, at Microsoft and Apple, the strategy tends to come from the top down, while individual PMs execute on that strategy. This isn’t to say that PMs in top-down companies can’t influence strategy, but many PMs won’t until they’re quite senior. Great PMs at these companies influence strategy by pitching their ideas to executives and winning them over.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Company Culture</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Another big difference is the company culture. At companies like Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Facebook, there’s a lightheartedness during the work day. These companies are proud of their excellent perks such as free food and drinks, or even free massages. And while people may work long hours, they’ll always say that the quality of their work is more important than the number of hours they put in.</p><p class="calibre_1">On the other hand, some companies, such as Apple and Amazon, have a culture where employees are proud of how hard they work. At these companies, it is expected that employees work long hours, and frugality is valued. Employees at these companies are so inspired by the company’s mission that they’re happy to work weekends or take calls late at night. Building an amazing product isn’t meant to be easy.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Who they recruit</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Amazon prefers MBAs for the product manager role and doesn’t consider a technical background to be critical. This is one of the few companies that don’t hire new college graduates into the product manager role. They do, however, accept new graduates as program managers or technical program managers, a related role that skews more towards project management than product design.</p><p class="calibre_1">Apple hires for both hardware and software EPM (engineering program manager) roles, so it’s a good choice for people with a background in electrical engineering or computer science. Apple hires new college graduates and doesn’t tend to hire people with MBAs as engineering program managers.</p><p class="calibre_1">Facebook is the most technical of the group, requiring that all product managers be technical. The company values its entrepreneurial “hacker” culture and has a substantial number of PMs who were founders of acquired companies, as well as quite a few ex-Google PMs. They hire new college graduates into the rotational product manager role, which includes 3 four-month rotations across teams.</p><p class="calibre_1">Google prefers to hire new college graduates, usually computer science majors, starting them in the associate product manager (APM) program, a two-year rotational program. Some Google PMs have MBAs, but Google places more emphasis on master’s degrees or PhDs.</p><p class="calibre_1">Yahoo mostly hires experienced PMs but has also started an associate product manager program to hire new graduates. Yahoo values people with technical backgrounds who can communicate well with engineers. They look for passionate people with good product sense and who are entrepreneurial, but also have a realistic sense of what it means to deliver software to hundreds of millions of users.</p><p class="calibre_1">Microsoft hires both new college graduates and experienced hires for the Program Manager role and prefers a technical background, though it doesn’t have to be specifically computer science. Separately, Microsoft hires MBAs into the product manager role, which is a marketing role at Microsoft. Microsoft does well at recruiting internationally and hires many PMs from outside the US.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_16"></div>
