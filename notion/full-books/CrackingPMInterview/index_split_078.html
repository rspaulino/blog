<p id="filepos423310" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">“What are your strengths and weaknesses?”</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">While many interviewers have moved away from this question, it’s still commonplace enough that you should be prepared for it. Be prepared for your interview with three strengths and three weaknesses.</p><p class="calibre_1">For your strengths, focus on things that are specific, relevant to the position, and can be supported with evidence. For example, you could say something like this:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">“I have a ton of initiative. I’m not afraid to get my hands dirty or take a risk. At my last job, I felt a lot of non-engineers would benefit from understanding more about how the product is built. I started a weekly lunch program where engineers would give technical talks to non-technical people about the product, recent developments in technology, and other related topics. Almost everyone in the company came to at least one talk each month, and about 10 percent of the company attended every single talk.”</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29">“I’m scrappy and find creative ways to get things done. For example, I wanted to teach a class in college, and undergraduates were not really allowed to do that. By partnering with a well-respected professor who would officially oversee the class but not get directly involved, I was able to teach something entirely on my own.”</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29">“I think one of my biggest strengths is, interestingly, a lack of stubbornness. I can be passionate about my ideas, but I’m also not afraid to admit I’m wrong. This has helped me be flexible when aspects of the product or marketing changed quickly, and it’s also helped build my coworkers’ trust in me.”</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">Do not list “intelligence” as a strength. Yes, you might be very intelligent. Yes, it is relevant to the position. However, listing this just comes across as arrogant, and, frankly, the interviewer will make her own decision as to whether or not you’re intelligent.</p><p class="calibre_1">For weaknesses, you want to give a genuine weakness. The old trick of disguising a positive attribute as a weakness (“I work too hard”) does not work—and probably never has. Your interviewer wants to see that you can admit to your faults.</p><p class="calibre_1">That said, it is a good idea to accentuate—or at least mention—the positive side of the weakness. What have you learned from it? Are there any benefits to this? How do you compensate for this weakness?</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">“I’m often not very detail oriented. While this has some benefits, particularly in an entrepreneurial environment by helping me move faster, it also means I’ve made some embarrassing mistakes in the past. I’ve developed a good sense though of the types of situations where I’m likely to make mistakes, and I double or triple check my work in those cases.”</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29">“I can sometimes come across as too negative or critical, even when I don’t mean to be. I know I’ve hurt some people’s feelings in the past, especially earlier in my career. I’ve worked on my communication style a bunch to mitigate this. I precede any negative feedback with positive comments, and I ask questions instead of directly asserting the criticism.”</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29">“I can sometimes get distracted at work, particularly when I have a lot of different tasks on my plate. I try to do everything at once, get overwhelmed, and don’t make solid progress on any of them. I’ve found a way to deal with this when I have multiple competing responsibilities by developing a clear to-do list. This imposes more structure on my workday and prevents the feeling of being overwhelmed.”</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">If it makes you feel more comfortable or helps you accentuate the positive, you can phrase your weakness as “One of the things I’m working on is ….” This can show you are working on your weaknesses and shift it around in your head to a topic you don’t mind talking about.</p><p class="calibre_1">Generally, try to avoid weaknesses that are too tactical or temporary. An answer like, “I don’t have much experience in people management.” doesn’t help an interviewer get to know you and doesn’t show humbleness. In fact, it just looks as if you’re afraid to admit to genuine weaknesses—or don’t think you have any personality faults.</p><p class="calibre_1">Of course, candidates can go too far to the other side and offer up a deeply detrimental weakness, such as lack of honesty or a poor work ethic. This is very rare to see, though. When candidates flunk the weaknesses question, it’s almost always because they came across as trying to hide genuine faults.</p><p class="calibre_1">Below, we have provided a list of sample strengths and weaknesses. This is only to get you started; your strengths and weaknesses might not be on this list. You should pick ones that ring true for you.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"> </span></span></p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_78"></div>
