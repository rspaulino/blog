<p id="filepos818834" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">How To Approach</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">Coding and algorithm questions are designed to test your problem-solving skills. Therefore, you want to show the interviewer how you’re approaching the problem.</p><p class="calibre_1">The following approach works well:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ol class="calibre_38"><li value="1" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Clarify the Problem:</span></span><span class="calibre4"> Make sure you understand what the problem is asking. Ask questions to verify any assumptions. For example, if it’s a binary tree, is it a binary search tree? Is it balanced? You might even want to repeat the problem back in your own words.</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Go to the Whiteboard:</span></span><span class="calibre4"> When you hear a problem, go to the whiteboard and create an example for this problem. Your example should be general enough to help you solve the problem and should avoid special cases.</span></li><li value="3" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Talk Out Loud:</span></span><span class="calibre4"> Talk out loud and brainstorm solutions with your interviewer. If you can think of a brute-force solution, but you don’t think it’s good enough, go ahead and explain that solution to your interviewer. At least it will give you a jumping-off point for solving the problem.</span></li><li value="4" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Think Critically:</span></span><span class="calibre4"> Once you’ve come up with an algorithm, think through whether it really works. What is its big O time? Can you do better? Does it actually solve the problem? Are there any cases where it will fail?</span></li><li value="5" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Code, Slowly and Methodically:</span></span><span class="calibre4"> Once you and your interviewer are comfortable with the code, go ahead and start coding on the whiteboard. If it helps, you can write out some pseudocode first. Make sure when you’re coding that you really, truly understand what you’re doing. If you get confused while you’re coding, take a step back and think through your algorithm. Rushing will not help you do better.</span></li><li value="6" class="calibre_39"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Test and Fix:</span></span><span class="calibre4"> Just because there’s no computer doesn’t mean you don’t test. You must test your code. In this case, you’ll walk through your code with the edge cases and normal cases. When you find bugs—and you will (bug-free code is unusual in an interview)—think through what caused the bug, and then carefully fix it.</span></li></ol><p class="calibre_1">Observe that the coding part is Step 5, not Step 1. Do not just get up to the whiteboard and start coding once you hear a problem. Take your time to brainstorm a solution with your interviewer. The algorithm part often takes up most of the interview, and sometimes even the entire interview.</p><p class="calibre_1">Remember: if you’re struggling to solve a problem, that’s normal. These problems are designed to be difficult.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_110"></div>
