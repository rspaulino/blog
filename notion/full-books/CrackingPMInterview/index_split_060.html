</span><a href="#filepos344100"><span class="calibre4">(go to Improved Resume)</span></a><span class="calibre4">
</span></p><p class="calibre_31">Adam’s resume did fit on one page, but it was still very lengthy. Numerous blocks of text means his best stuff gets skipped over in just a brief glance.</p><p class="calibre_1">Additionally, his resume lacked specifics and clarity.</p><p class="calibre_1">For instance, consider his work experience at AOL. There was something about a “welcome experience,” but it was unclear what that meant exactly. After that, he said he used UserVoice to collect feedback, shared results, began work on something, and helped with something else. None of these are really clear accomplishments.</p><p class="calibre_1">His description of his work with HotWire has similar issues. He “worked with” some people, “helped to” do something else, was a “member of” another group, and participated in some “exercise.” These lack the “umph” they could have.</p><p class="calibre_1">With LiveJournal, we see some clear accomplishments, but they could still be better. The part about “reversed declining paid subscriber trend” is fantastic, but it would be even better backed up with numbers. He says he used traffic metrics to determine positioning and attract advertisers. “Attracting advertisers” is just slipped into the middle of the bullet and isn’t backed up with numbers; even if a reader noticed it, it wouldn’t be very credible.</p><p class="calibre_1">Adam’s resume was by no means terrible; in fact, it was better than most resumes. It still could be so much better, though.</p><p class="calibre_1">Adam took this feedback and redid (and updated) his resume. Here’s what he came up with. Observe how:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">His AOL work is clearer (we can now understand what the welcome experience was) and more focused on his own accomplishments.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29">His HotWire work shows more leadership. It’s now about what he led, not who he worked with. He also now has numbers to back up how he reduced costs. We also now learn it wasn’t just an “exercise.” This was something performed with a meaningful impact.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29">For LiveJournal, he’s provided numbers on how the subscriber trend changed. That makes them more credible <span class="italic">and</span> makes someone more likely to notice that in a quick skim. He’s now stated he attracted two new advertisers (although this might be even stronger if he could say how much money that brought in). He’s also added a new bullet about growing connections.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29">His summary is more meaningful. Anyone can claim they have a “talent for recognizing consumer value,” so that’s not very meaningful. The new summary feels more tangible.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_29">He’s kept his social networking usernames in. This can be a nice way for companies to learn more about you.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">His bullets are still a bit lengthy, but his resume has improved substantially. Before, we would walk away from his resume with a general impression of what sorts of things he was responsible for. Now, we know that not only was he responsible for some interesting things, but he’s also been successful. That’s what you should be trying to do in your resume.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">New and Improved</span></span></p><p class="calibre_30"><a href="#filepos344287"><span class="calibre4">(go to Original)</span></a><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre4">
