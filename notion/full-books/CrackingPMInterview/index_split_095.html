<p id="filepos635173" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Type 2: Improving a Product</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">These questions can be asked in general terms (“Pick a product. How would you improve it?”) or by targeting a specific product (“How would you improve Product X?”). Either way, the secret to these questions is identifying and understanding the product’s biggest issues.</p><p class="calibre_1">You may notice the approach for this type of problem will be very similar to “Design a product” questions. This is to be expected. The key difference is you’re taking an existing product, assessing the issues, and improving it from there.</p><p class="calibre_1">Structure is, again, very important here. You don’t have to be quite as explicit in outlining your structure, but you should tackle it in an organized fashion. A simple line like this will work: “Let me start first with understanding the goals of the product, then move on to the issues and how to solve those. Okay, so the goals of the product are…”</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Step 1: What is the goal of the product?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">First, you need to understand the product’s ultimate goal. What problems is it solving for the user?</p><p class="calibre_1">Facebook, for example, allows you to post status updates and share photos. That’s not the <span class="italic">goal</span> of the product, though. The goal is to connect and share your life with your family and friends.</p><p class="calibre_1">Note that a product might have primary and secondary goals. Facebook’s primary goal for consumers is connecting with family and friends, but business users have a different goal: engaging with existing and potential customers.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Step 2: What problems does the product face?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Next, you need to assess the problems the product faces.</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">Does it need to expand its user base? If so, should it broaden its user base by entering a new market, or should it expand in its existing market?</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29">Does it need to increase revenue? If so, is this about increasing revenue per user or about increasing the number of paying users?</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29">Does it need to increase user engagement?</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29">Does it need to increase conversions from visitors to registered users?</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">To assess this, think about how the product is currently designed. What does the product appear to prioritize?</p><p class="calibre_1">Of course, you can also ask your interviewer what the key problems are, but you don’t want to come off as being unable to figure this out on your own. You might therefore want to make some educated guesses about what area to focus your improvements on, and then validate this direction with the interviewer.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Step 3: How would you solve this problem?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Third, brainstorm a few ways you might solve this problem and discuss the pros and cons of each. Again, be open about the tradeoffs of each option.</p><p class="calibre_1">Your ideas might be bold, crazy ideas, or they might be small, iterative improvements. Both approaches (and everything in between) have immense value in the real world.</p><p class="calibre_1">However, some companies have more of a preference for one or the other based on their size, risk tolerance, budget, or culture. If you know which way the company leans, you can focus your discussion there. Otherwise, preface what you’re suggesting accordingly:</p><blockquote class="calibre_23"><span class="italic">We can make a few quick fixes that will help mitigate this issue. However, if we are willing to take a bigger gamble, some additional options are open to us.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">As far as the quick fixes, we can …</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_19">Doing this will allow you to demonstrate you understand that while big changes come with big rewards, they also come with big risks. A good PM needs to balance those.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Step 4: How would you implement these solutions?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">If it’s not immediately obvious, discuss with your interviewer how you would implement the solution you proposed. What are the bigger technical or business challenges? How could you reduce the costs or risks associated with the solution? For example, you might test out your solution on a small user base or roll out a limited prototype.</p><p class="calibre_1">Many startups in particular will value a PM who is “scrappy” and can do a lot with limited resources. Show this side of yourself.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Step 5: How would you validate your solution?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">A good PM knows he’s not always right and that his suggestions are little more than an educated guess. Therefore, he will prioritize validating his solution.</p><p class="calibre_1">Discuss with your interviewer what metrics you would gather to see if your solution really worked. For example, if you suggest sending “People who bought X also bought Y” emails to users in order to increase revenue per user, you may want to track metrics such as email clicks, direct referrals to product Y, future purchases of product Y from this set of users, and purchases of other products. You might also want to come up with some approaches to ensure the emails don’t harass users or make them unsubscribe from all emails.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_95"></div>
