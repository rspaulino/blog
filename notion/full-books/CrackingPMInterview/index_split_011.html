That’s accurate in some ways, since a PM takes holistic responsibility for the product, from the little details to the big picture. The PM needs to set vision and strategy. The PM defines success and makes decisions.</p><p class="calibre_1">But in one of the most important ways, the description of product manager as CEO misses the boat: product managers don’t have direct authority over the people on their team.</p><p class="calibre_1">As a PM, you’ll need to learn to lead your team without authority, influencing them with your vision and research. Product managers are highly respected at most companies, but not more so than engineers. If you show up and start bossing people around, you’ll probably find it hard to get things done. After all, engineers are the ones actually building the product. You need them on your side.</p><p class="calibre_1">One reason product management is such an appealing career is you get to sit at the intersection of technology, business, and design. You get to wear many hats and learn multiple points of view.</p><p class="calibre_1">As a product manager, you’ll be the advocate for the customer. You’ll learn their needs and translate those needs into product goals and features. Then you’ll make sure those features are built in a cohesive, well-designed way that actually solves the customer’s needs. You’ll focus on everything from the big picture to the small details. One day you might brainstorm the three-year vision for your team, while the next day you work through the details of the buttons in a dialog.</p><p class="calibre_1">Product management is a highly collaborative role. The product manager usually serves as the main liaison between the engineerings and other roles such as design, quality assurance, user research, data analysts, marketing, sales, customer support, business development, legal, content writers, other engineering teams, and the executive team. It’s usually the job of the product manager to identify times when one of those teams should be brought in, and to fill in for them if they don’t exist.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_11"></div>
