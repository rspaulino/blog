Greater accessibility is a good thing for candidates and employers alike.</p><p class="calibre_1">You, the candidate, are better able to position yourself for a job when you know what to expect. It’s not about faking anything; you can actually acquire the experience you need once you know you need it.</p><p class="calibre_1">When it comes time for interviews, you’ll able to prepare for their questions more effectively. You will learn how to describe your unique experiences and most important accomplishments. You’ll learn how to tackle problem-solving questions. You’ll understand what it means to think about the user. And, finally, you’ll solidify your technical skills.</p><p class="calibre_1">Employers, in turn, get more qualified candidates. More relaxed and better prepared candidates perform in a way that is more consistent with their skillset. They know which accomplishments are most interesting and relevant to employers, and they can drive the conversation toward those things. They can demonstrate their problem-solving skills when they know that’s what the question is about. They can learn the bits of knowledge that they need in order to tackle specific questions. This sort of preparation portrays a candidate’s skillset closer to how it would be on the job.</p><p class="calibre_1">Taking the guesswork and randomness out of interviews is a good thing for everyone.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_7"></div>
