<p id="filepos271484" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Dropbox</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">Drew (Co-Founder and CEO) tells each new hire that their #1 job is to recruit other talented people. Given this, it’s not surprising that almost half of new hires are referrals and the recruiting team is very active in sourcing candidates from existing PMs.</p><p class="calibre_1">While the interview process is still evolving, the PM candidate profile is very well defined. Dropbox is looking for people with a technical background that also have experience as a startup founder or who have demonstrated substantial accomplishments as a PM at an established company.</p><p class="calibre_1">Once you’re in the door, you go through two phone screens with other PMs who ask typical PM questions about your favorite products and potential improvements.</p><p class="calibre_1">If you are invited onsite, you will typically face four interviews with PMs, engineers, and product designers. These will include PMs who ask product questions, engineers who go through a technical screen, and product designers who may ask you to design a new product workflow on the whiteboard. Either that day or soon after, you’ll also interview with Arash (Co-Founder and CTO) who asks product questions related to Dropbox and also screens for cultural fit.</p><p class="calibre_1">Depending on current needs and candidate backgrounds, PMs may be hired for a specific team or simply as a generalist to jump into a specific team soon after starting.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">How Decisions Get Made</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">After the interviews, the interviewers will debrief together to make a decision. The recruiter is in touch with the interviewers throughout the day, so if you don’t pass the initial interviews, you may not speak with Arash. The bar is high and Dropbox will take their time to find the right candidate.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Special Focuses</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">One of Dropbox’s engineering values is to “sweat the details,” and it applies to the PMs as well. Be prepared to think through all the edge cases of your product answers and designs in detail. Cultural fit is also extremely important, but they don’t ask any special questions to screen for it.</p><p class="calibre_1">Dropbox has a very focused set of products, so be familiar with all of them and think through what you would do if you were a PM there.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_50"></div>
