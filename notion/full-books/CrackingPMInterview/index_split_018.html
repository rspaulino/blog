<p id="filepos83514" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Microsoft</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">Microsoft originated the PM role in the 1980s when they realized that they needed someone between the marketing and engineering teams who focused on making the product usable for customers.</p><p class="calibre_1">At Microsoft, the program manager role is unique in scope and influence. A PM serves as a business analyst, a project manager, and a creative force. Microsoft also has one of the highest PM-to-developer ratios. These combine to make the Microsoft PM role a very hands-on position. Teams are frequently PM-driven, with the program manager making every user-facing decision.</p><p class="calibre_1">As one of the older tech companies, Microsoft has developed a strong focus on career growth. They’ve learned that employees want to see their careers progressing and have built a system where people can grow not only by becoming team leads, but also by becoming responsible for larger products and more product strategy. Microsoft is a company where many employees expect to spend their whole career.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Who they recruit</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Microsoft looks for program managers who are big-picture thinkers, who can solve problems, and who can get stuff done.</p><p class="calibre_1">Uche from Microsoft says, “We wants people with inquisitive minds. People who look at things from multiple perspectives. As a PM, you’ll wear many hats, so how you think is more important than any particular technical skill.”</p><p class="calibre_1">Microsoft has two roles related to program management that are usually filled by people with MBAs: product managers and product planners. Product managers at Microsoft are on the marketing team, identifying market opportunities and developing strategies for moving on those opportunities, focused on the current release. Product planners are looking further ahead, identifying market and technology trends to come up with new product scenarios.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">What they do</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">On Microsoft products, the vision and strategy often come from the top and work their way down.</p><p class="calibre_1">For example, the VP in charge of Microsoft Office will work with the group program managers to create and share a vision document with the main areas of focus for the next release. The people in charge of each Office product will define the vision for their product so it falls in line with the overall Office vision. Then each of the team leads uses the Office vision and the product vision to develop visions for their feature areas.</p><p class="calibre_1">The result is that the product strategy at Microsoft within a division is very cohesive. The teams feel like they’re working together towards the same goal, and it’s rare to find two teams that are working on competing features. As your career advances at Microsoft, you pick up larger and larger pieces of the strategy.</p><p class="calibre_1">The top-down vision makes it hard to make big changes in direction in the middle of a launch cycle. Even if the idea is great, it’s hard to find developers with spare time to build it. On the other hand, you’re generally working on features that everyone agrees are important. This means that you can spend your energy trying to build something great instead of convincing management to let you launch the great thing you built.</p><p class="calibre_1">As a new PM at Microsoft, you’ll be put in charge of feature areas that work with the team’s vision, and you will be given a lot of freedom and responsibility to make those parts of the product great. As you prove yourself on your early teams, you’re given more and more responsibility.</p><p class="calibre_1">The core feature team at Microsoft includes a developer, a program manager, and a tester. Recently, some teams are bringing a designer into the core feature team. Together the core feature team, led by the PM, decides what to build. On many teams, the PM starts by writing a one-page “spec”—a high-level description of the goals and use cases.</p><p class="calibre_1">After reviewing the one-page spec with other program managers on the product, the PM may expand the one-page spec into a detailed spec that describes exactly how the feature will work, from high-level flows down to the text of the error messages. The PM might also work with a designer or may do all of the interaction design herself. This is team dependent though.</p><p class="calibre_1">Once the spec is reviewed and implementation starts, dogfooding (trying early builds of the software internally) becomes very important. Especially on teams with slow ship cycles, PMs at Microsoft gather feedback from other people at the company. As that feedback comes in, the PM prioritizes the bugs and new feature ideas.</p><p class="calibre_1">Outside of the core feature work, PMs will also take on some team-wide or cross-team responsibilities. One example is running the project management schedule for the product or running a pre-launch triage process to decide which bugs to fix or which features to implement.</p><p class="calibre_1">As Microsoft adjusts to its new reorganization as a devices and services company, the spec-heavy process is being replaced with a more agile and iterative approach on many teams. Teams are starting to launch faster and more frequently. A/B testing is becoming more prominent.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_18"></div>
