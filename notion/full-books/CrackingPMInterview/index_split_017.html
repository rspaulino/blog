<p id="filepos78497" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Google</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">Google’s structure reflects its startup roots. Google is passionate about innovation and really values a culture where great ideas can become reality. Google’s vision comes from the bottom up, and teams are often engineering driven. Product managers focus on strategy, analysis, and facilitation of the engineering team.</p><p class="calibre_1">One thing that makes Google unique is the incredible transparency across the organization. Most code and documentation is available to any full-time Googler, and the executive team takes questions from all Googlers at the weekly all-hands “TGIF” presentation. It’s not unusual for Google PMs to switch product teams during their career at Google.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Who they recruit</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Google looks for entrepreneurial self-motivated people who love technology. Candidates with MBAs or more than four years of experience join as product managers, while those with fewer than four years of experience apply to be associate product managers (APMs).</p><p class="calibre_1">The APM program is an elite two-year product management training program for new graduates. APMs are given important product management roles on teams across the company, along with training, networking opportunities, a midpoint job rotation, and an international business trip to meet Googlers and customers around the world.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">What they do</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Google has a lot of products, and the product management role can vary a lot across teams. While product design thinking and analytical skills are important in all of the roles, the balance will vary a lot across products like Google Search, Adwords, Gmail, Android, YouTube, Google Plus, and Google Maps.</p><p class="calibre_1">The Search team tends to be very research driven, with engineers taking the lead on inventing new algorithms. For advertiser-facing teams, PMs gather customer requirements and communicate those needs to the rest of the team. On teams like Google Plus, designers are central to the team, while developer-facing teams might not have a designer at all.</p><p class="calibre_1">PMs at Google work independently. PMs join a team, and it’s up to the individual PMs and their teams to decide what they’re going to build. Often, a PM’s first project at Google is to figure out what they should be working on.</p><p class="calibre_1">Many products have only one PM, and for those that have more, the work is usually cleanly partitioned so that each PM owns a full area. In the day-to-day work as a Google PM, you’ll work most closely with your engineering team and designer. Many new ideas come from PMs, engineers, and designers drawing ideas on whiteboards and then quickly building prototypes.</p><p class="calibre_1">Google strongly values analytical skills in its PMs, since data analysis can be a big part of a PM’s job. PMs frequently look through the usage logs to come up with ideas for new projects in the Search and Ads divisions. Once a team has built something, Google makes it easy to try it out in front of a tiny percentage of users. Then the data starts rolling in, and the PM analyzes the data (or works with data analysts) to see if the changes were an improvement.</p><p class="calibre_1">A big part of the PM job at Google is getting projects in shape for launch. Since even small changes will be seen by many millions of users, it’s important to get all of the pieces right, including the UI and algorithms. A project must also meet security, legal, and infrastructure requirements. Many projects go through multiple rounds of iteration before getting a final approval.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Innovation</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">To encourage innovation, Google has a program called “20% time.” This is a policy where engineers and PMs can spend 20% of their time on a company-related side project. To start a 20% project, you don’t need any approval; you just start working on it. There are internal sites where you can post your project and try to recruit other people to join you. Many big products at Google such as Gmail, Google News, and Orkut started in someone’s 20% time.</p><p class="calibre_1">All of this innovation and freedom can make Google a PM’s dream. If you have a project you’re passionate about, not only do you get the time and freedom to work on it, but you’re also surrounded by brilliant engineers who have extra time to help out!</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_17"></div>
