It will, however, give you a plan of attack, from the beginning to the end of the process.</p><p class="calibre_1">We will show you what a product manager is and how the role varies from company to company. We will also describe how different companies think about their hiring process.</p><p class="calibre_1">We will talk to product managers from a variety of backgrounds to understand how they broke into this field and to get their perspective on what makes a good product manager.</p><p class="calibre_1">We will talk about the different backgrounds PMs tend to have and how you might make the transition given your background and interests.</p><p class="calibre_1">We will show you how to write a great resume and cover letter. Some of this will be advice that applies outside of product management, but much of it is advice specific to product managers.</p><p class="calibre_1">We will advise you on how to get ready for an interview: what sort of research you need to do prior to an interview and how to prepare for questions. We will tackle each of the major interview question types—including behavioral questions, estimation questions, product questions, case questions, and coding questions—and explain to you what an interviewer is looking for and how you master those questions.</p><p class="calibre_1">We will help you put your best foot forward so you can get in the door.</p><p class="calibre_1">As you read these pages, reflect on how you can draw out the strong points of your experience in an interview and how you can deliver more powerful responses.</p><p class="calibre_1">We are here to help. Please join us online at crackingthepminterview.com for additional resources and tips.</p><p class="calibre_1">And finally, just as software is never “done,” we hope this book will never be either.
