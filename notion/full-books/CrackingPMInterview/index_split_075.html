<p id="filepos410818" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">“Why are you leaving your current job?”</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">Often, this question is asked as an icebreaker. Your interviewer isn’t necessarily looking for anything specific; she just wants to learn a bit more about you. Your goal is essentially to not screw things up.</p><p class="calibre_1">What can screw up an answer? Any of these things:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Complaining about your current role.</span> Interviewers don’t like negative candidates. They worry that candidates will always be negative—even after being hired—or that the candidate’s dislike of her current role is actually her own fault. If you have a bad relationship with your boss, this could be as much your fault as it is your boss’ fault.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Focusing on money.</span> A candidate who is just looking for more money often doesn’t make a great employee. An interviewer might worry that such a candidate lacks passion and commitment for the job, and will leave that company as soon as the opportunity for more cash comes up.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Being bored and not learning.</span> While there are ways to spin this in a positive way, being bored at your current role means your most recent experience isn’t very valuable or interesting. This is probably not the way you want to kick off your interview.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">Instead, focus on the positive. What are the things you are looking forward to in a new role?</p><p class="calibre_1">Any of these reasons, which range from benign to positive, would work as an explanation:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">“To be honest, I’m actually pretty happy in my current role and wasn’t really looking to leave. I stumbled across this job opening though, and it sounded like such a great opportunity I just couldn’t pass it up.”</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29">“After being a development manager for several years, I’ve acquired deep technology and leadership experience. I now want to take those skills to move more into the product management side, since I really love the experience of launching a new product.”</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29">“I’ve had to relocate for personal reasons.”</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29">“My company was acquired last year, so it’s changed a lot. I’d like to be back in a more entrepreneurial environment.”</li><li value="5" class="calibre_29">“I actually really like my current company and role, but after being there for several years, I want to be somewhere which is giving more back to the world.”</li><li value="6" class="calibre_29">“I have a really deep statistics background and I really enjoy being quantitative. I want to be somewhere where I can use this more directly.”</li><li value="7" class="calibre_29">“The current team I’m on is more enterprise focused, and I want to move closer to the consumer.”</li><li value="8" class="calibre_29">“I’ve gotten a lot of great opportunities in my current role, but after being there for three years, I feel my learning has slowed down a bit. The company and space just aren’t growing that much. I want to take on new challenges.”</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">This is not a time to blabber for a while. Keep it short and sweet; one to three sentences should be enough to handle this question.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_75"></div>
