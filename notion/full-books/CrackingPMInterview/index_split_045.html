<p id="filepos257202" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Facebook</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">Facebook was built on a hacker culture, and this shows in their culture. Facebook wants PMs who show this entrepreneurial drive.</p><p class="calibre_1">Like other companies, PM candidates start off with one or two phone interviews. The phone interviews often cover behavioral questions, and may also ask why you are passionate about Facebook. The best answers may include anecdotes about real-world experiences with Facebook or a desire to have a big impact and work with smart people.</p><p class="calibre_1">If you do well on the phone interviews, you’ll be brought in for four to five onsite interviews. Each interviewer wears a specific “hat”:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Technical and Logical:</span> You will be asked some quantitative questions, especially around metrics and implementing experiments. If you have a technical background, you might also be asked to code (although Facebook has relaxed this requirement more recently).</li><li value="2" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Design:</span> These will include typical product design questions. Additionally, if you’ve built anything, they may ask to see it. Think about what services and apps you like and why you like them.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Futurist:</span> These include questions like, “What is the future of TV?” Show that you can reason about the future. You don’t just want to talk about symptoms of the future; you want to think about what will fundamentally change to get that way and what effect those changes will have. You want to be a storyteller.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_29"><span class="bold">Guru:</span> For experienced roles, they’ll ask about your core strengths. They want to check your sense of self to see if you understand what you’re good at.</li></ul><p class="calibre_1">Entry-level PMs generally get hired at Facebook as generalists rather than for a specific team.</p><p class="calibre_1">Experienced PMs mostly interview for a specific team, but Facebook still expects these candidates to be generalists at heart. They will interview with some team members and some non-team members.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">How Decisions Get Made</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Facebook interviewers do not directly make offer decisions. Instead, interviewers submit written feedback to a hiring committee which is a mix of peers, managers, and recruiters.</p><p class="calibre_1">You will be evaluated in several categories during your interview. The hiring committee will need to see strong performance on all of these categories to extend an offer.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Special Focuses</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Typically, Facebook will ask PM candidates to code. They understand you might not have coded in a long time, and that will be taken into account. What they’re looking for here is someone who can think like a software engineer. Do you understand, more or less, how to break down a problem into steps? Knowing the ins and outs of data structures and algorithms is generally not expected, but you should know some basic ones like hash tables.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_45"></div>
