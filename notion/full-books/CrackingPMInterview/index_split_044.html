<p id="filepos253114" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Microsoft</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">Microsoft’s process is perhaps the simplest and most straightforward of any company. In fact, the interview processes of many other companies appear to be a derivative of the Microsoft process: swap out the hiring committee for a hiring managers, and voila.</p><p class="calibre_1">At Microsoft, candidates usually start with one or two phone screens. If you’re a college candidate, this interview might take place on your college campus.</p><p class="calibre_1">Sometimes a recruiter does an initial screen. That’s no reason to drop your guard; just because it’s by a recruiter doesn’t mean it can’t be challenging.</p><p class="calibre_1">Candidates with work experience often have a technical screen as well.</p><p class="calibre_1">After the phone screens, candidates are flown out to Redmond for a full day of interviews. Candidates will generally interview with a specific team. The requirements might change from team to team, so a candidate who is a great fit for one team might be a lousy fit for another.</p><p class="calibre_1">If you interview with the hiring manager or a more senior person at the end of the day, this is a good sign. It often means you have gotten a “hire” from a technical point of view, and they often are just testing cultural fit or fit with Microsoft as a whole. It may also be that they are teasing out some final points people were on the fence about. This interview is called the “as app” (“as appropriate”) interview.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">How Decisions Get Made</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">After your interview, the interviewers for a team discuss your performance via email or an in-person meeting. They make a decision and pass it back to a recruiter who will get together an offer packet, if necessary.</p><p class="calibre_1">In some cases, candidates discover they will receive an offer before they have even left Microsoft’s campus. This might seem shocking, but remember: all that interviewers need to do is provide their feedback and potentially discuss it quickly. If all your interviewers happen to be available that day to chat, decisions can happen very quickly.</p><p class="calibre_1">If this doesn’t happen to you though, don’t be disheartened. Being able to make rapid decisions has to do with your interviewers’ schedules and the number of other candidates in the pipeline, not your performance.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Special Focuses</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Microsoft in particular likes behavioral questions and product design questions.</p><p class="calibre_1">In product design questions, pay attention to the details and be sure to ask probing questions. Microsoft interviewers often enjoy testing how you handle ambiguity. They might, for example, ask you to design a pen and not mention that it’s a pen for astronauts. They want to see that you ask a lot of questions to understand the customer before running down some path.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Extra Goodies</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Now that we’ve generalized about what Microsoft does, we should also leave you with this advice: be careful about generalizations at Microsoft, particularly with respect to hiring. What your buddy experienced at Microsoft might have little to do with what you’ll experience.</p><p class="calibre_1">Microsoft teams hire mostly independently. One team might want deep technical skills and therefore demand that you write some pseudocode, while other teams might want to test your design skills. It’s all over the map.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_44"></div>
