<p id="filepos101390" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Yahoo</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">Yahoo has a strong legacy: at one point, “Yahoo” was synonymous with “The Internet” for many people. The company has gone through a series of transitions in the last several years, but in 2012, Marissa Mayer was appointed as CEO, and she brought renewed energy and passion into the company. Web traffic is up, many recent product announcements and launches have been well received, and you can see a clear change in perception both internally and externally.</p><p class="calibre_1">PMs who work at Yahoo love the excitement of having such a clear challenge. They’re now focused on getting back into the hearts and minds of users by putting their needs first. With a former product manager at the helm, Yahoo is strongly product driven and looking to build products that users love.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Who they recruit</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">PMs at Yahoo generally have a CS degree, although it’s not required. Yahoo looks for talent with strong engineering background demonstrated through academic achievements and/or work experience at a top-tier software company.</p><p class="calibre_1">Today, Yahoo has a great mix of PMs: some have been at Yahoo for a long time, others have joined recently from other tech companies, and still others are fresh out of college. While each Yahoo PM possesses a different background and experience, they all have one common goal of bringing Yahoo products and its experiences to the next level.</p><p class="calibre_1">Yahoo started the Associate Product Manager (APM) Program with a goal of hiring talented new graduates. It’s a two-year rotational program with regular training presentations from people across the company and a global business trip in the middle. Two things that make the Yahoo APM program stand out are that APMs learn which team they’re on before they start working and that the organizers are focusing on getting all of the APMs into big, challenging roles.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">What they do</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Teams at Yahoo are often organized into a trio of engineer, product manager, and designer, with one person serving as the group lead. The group lead is oftentimes a product manager.</p><p class="calibre_1">The product manager is responsible for setting the overall direction and strategy for products, making sure the user experience is solid and developing long-term growth. This includes the user-experience and long-term monetization plans, and teams are no longer pressured to look for short-term revenue wins.</p><p class="calibre_1">Yahoo has a strong culture of collaboration, and ideas come from every corner of the company. Getting the mobile experience right for Yahoo’s core products is a key driver of the company’s efforts.</p><p class="calibre_1">Most Yahoo PMs are very technical, and PMs are well respected within the company. PMs are involved in the full spectrum of the product life cycle; they run experiments, work closely with cross-functional teams, and oversee the entire launch process. There is an official review process for product launches that helps keep the quality bar of the products high before they are made available to users.</p><p class="calibre_1">Teams at Yahoo are moving a lot faster, and many are picking up Agile processes. Many teams work in short iterations. Instead of long, detailed specs, PMs now might just write a one-sentence user story, and the engineers will make decisions and get it out.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_22"></div>
