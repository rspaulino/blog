<p id="filepos109621" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Startups</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">Startups can be great places for PMs to make an impact and have a part in shaping their own role. More so than at larger companies, product managers at startups really have to wear a lot of hats and find scrappy ways to get things done.</p><p class="calibre_1">One of the best ways to get signal on the culture at a startup is to look at where the founders, PMs, and early employees came from. Since product management doesn’t have a single, well-known definition, teams generally bring along the definition that they learned from their past companies. A company founded by ex-Apple employees will tend to have elements of Apple’s culture, while one founded by ex-Google employees will tend to be more similar to Google.</p><p class="calibre_1">Once you’re ready to learn more about a startup, it can also make a lot of sense to reach out and try to get coffee with someone on the product team. At a startup, all of the employees are often involved in recruiting, so they’ll generally be happy to chat. Plus, they work at a startup, so they probably need that coffee!</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Who they recruit</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Startups vary a lot in the profile and skills they look for. In general, they’re more likely to look for people with experience shipping software and less likely to consider new graduates unless the company already has a large PM team.</p><p class="calibre_1">For startups, culture fit and passion for the company are really important. While a big company might be satisfied that your reason for wanting to join the company is “I want to work with a great team and have a big impact,” that’s not going to fly at a startup. They’ll want to hear a much more specific story about why you’re interested in their space.</p><blockquote class="calibre_23"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Getting the job</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_6">If you’re looking to land an early PM job at a startup, making a strong impression with your vision for the future of their industry can help you. Shalendra Chhabra (Shalen), now director of marketing at Indix, was able to get hired as an early PM at two different startups by using this approach, despite lacking strong connections to the companies.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_23">When he was looking for a new job, he brainstormed a list of startups with a friend. Swype, a company that makes on-screen keyboards for touch devices, was on that list. He was interested in the company and wrote a memo about how he saw the future: touch devices would explode in popularity, and they would want to expand into different languages and add new features such as predictive tap.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_23">In the memo, he described how his background and skills would add value to the company. He then was able to get an introduction to someone at the company through a friend of a friend and sent along his memo.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_23">Writing the memo took time and effort, but it was worth it. It helped him stand out to the company and gave him a chance to make a first impression on his own terms. When he walked into his interviews, he did so with credibility since people had circulated the memo. Eventually, Swype had a very successful exit, being acquired by Nuance for $102.5 million.</blockquote><p class="calibre_1">Referrals are important at all companies, but especially so at startups because they are less likely to want to take a risk. Where there are only a few PMs, each one makes a giant impact on the organization. It can help to reach out to people you know at the company, even if you don’t know them super well.</p><p class="calibre_1">In addition to referrals from employees, startups also look for referrals from their investors, advisors, and board members. You can consider applying through a venture capital firm or via a site like AngelList to get access to all of their portfolio companies.</p><p class="calibre_1">Finally, many startups recruit their first PM from inside the company.</p><p class="calibre_1">For example, Paul was in technical support at TechExcel and used his connection with the customers to make helpful product suggestions. The CEO then asked him to lead features.</p><p class="calibre_1">Similarly, Jesse was an engineer at Venmo who was interested in usability testing. He had shown leadership in organizing the team during a redesign, and the founders asked him to become their first PM.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">What they do</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Being a PM at a startup can be similar to being a PM at a large company. You’ll still be working with engineers and designers, and you’re still responsible for the success of your product. PMs at startups help define the roadmap, spec features, triage bugs, analyze experiments, and shepherd launches.</p><p class="calibre_1">The big difference in being a PM at a startup comes from the scale. Since startups don’t have large management structures, the PMs naturally become important leaders for the company. Additionally, startups have fewer resources, so there’s more “white space” for the PMs to fill in and more of a need to be really scrappy.</p><p class="calibre_1">PMs at startups often have a lot of influence over the company culture, processes, and roadmap. Jesse, the first PM at Venmo, was even able to shape the vision statement.</p><blockquote class="calibre_23"><span class="italic">When I first became a PM, I recognized the need to have a team mission to help everyone stay aligned. I organized a day where we all sat together and wrote down ideas to come up with the one sentence vision for Venmo: “To connect the world and empower people through payments.”</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_19">For PMs at startups, defining the role is an important part of the job. There’s less guidance and mentorship, since you’re not coming into a team of experienced PMs. Also, many roles that exist at a big company might not exist at a startup, so the PM might need to take on tasks like customer support, user research, data analysis, or sales until the company grows larger. At a startup, it’s unlikely that the CEO will tell the PM to take on these roles; usually the PM notices that there’s a gap and starts doing it himself.</p><p class="calibre_1">One thing that can be difficult as a company’s first PM is introducing process. Engineers at startups love shipping code quickly and are very wary of overhead, so it’s important to be careful when adding process like Agile. PMs need to make sure that everyone still has a voice and understands the reasons for adding timelines and milestones. It’s not always so bad though. In many cases, the team only brings in a PM once it is clear that more process is needed, so the team might already be on board.</p><p class="calibre_1">While startups have fewer resources within the company, they’re often more willing than large companies to go outside the company for help. PMs at startups often reach out to PMs at other startups to get and share advice. Many startups form relationships with other startups, so there’s a real community. For example, a B2B startup might find its early customers through connections made by their investors to other startups.</p><p class="calibre_1">Another big difference is around career advancement. At big companies, PMs are often thinking about getting promoted and climbing the career ladder. At a startup, the focus is much more on making the whole company successful: getting revenue, getting to profitability, having an IPO, or getting acquired. This means that PMs need to take a more holistic view of the company. It’s important to make the company, not just your team, successful.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Asana</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Asana is an enterprise startup that builds modern productivity software. Unlike traditional enterprise companies, Asana’s business model is bottom up: end users bring Asana into a team, not the IT department. This means PMs focus on building software that people love to use. The product team has PMs with backgrounds at Facebook, Google, and Microsoft.</p><p class="calibre_1">Jennifer, an Asana PM and former Microsoft PM, talks about what it’s like to move from a big company to a startup:</p><blockquote class="calibre_23"><span class="italic">Because we’re a small company with a flat hierarchy, I feel like I got promoted three times when I joined Asana. In addition to PMing meaty areas of the product, I influence other aspects of the company, such as product strategy, process, and culture.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">For example, I get to influence the overall schedule and cadence of the company, what the product’s design principles are, how much effort the company puts into creating new features vs. polishing existing features vs. improving internal efficiencies.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">And because our team is small and values continuous personal growth, I have the opportunity to work on very different areas of the product. Sometimes I work on features that require a lot of deep UI thinking, and sometimes I work on areas that require more data analysis.</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_19"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Foursquare</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Foursquare is a location-based social networking service that helps people make the most of where they are, whether that’s searching for the perfect place for dessert, learning about a concert in Central Park that’s trending, or discovering that a friend from out-of-town just landed at the airport.</p><p class="calibre_1">The PMs at Foursquare come predominantly from Google. Noah, a Foursquare PM, explains the impact this has.</p><blockquote class="calibre_23"><span class="italic">This has certainly influenced our culture. Rather than wholesale import of Google’s practices though, we’ve selectively chosen what makes sense for our size company. Over time, that has changed.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">When you’re 30 people, individual OKRs [Objectives and Key Results] are superfluous; everyone’s would just read ‘Do whatever I can to help the company survive and grow.’</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">Now that we’re 150 people, individual OKRs still seem like unneeded overhead, but we’ve started using team-level OKRs to keep track of firm metric goals.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">Compared to Google, we actually write more specs. I think it’s because projects move so much faster here. It means we need to quickly and early on work through the biggest and most contentious problems; we don’t have time for those to pop up later and cause delays. Specs aren’t meant to be comprehensive guides for how to build every piece of a feature. Instead, they’re meant to document the non-obvious decisions the team makes so people can reference back to it later.</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_19"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Dropbox</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Dropbox helps over a hundred million people keep their important files safe and available across many devices. You can easily upload photos from your phone, share files, or collaborate on a project. The product team includes PMs from Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Zynga, and several were startup founders prior to joining Dropbox.</p><p class="calibre_1">Matt, a PM at Dropbox, talks about what it’s like to work there:</p><blockquote class="calibre_23"><span class="italic">Working at a 200 person startup is pretty different from a larger company. As a PM at Google, I was very focused on building a great product and making my team successful. But at Dropbox’s size, I get to have more impact on shaping the company’s culture, how we build products, and how we think about the PM role itself. I get to work closely with the founders on defining our company vision and priorities and building out a great team.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">We look for PMs with a technical background, exceptional product instincts, and an eye for detail. Arash, our founder, will notice if a product detail is even one pixel off, so we expect our PMs to really ‘sweat the details.’</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">One of my favorite experiences was working to launch a new security feature (two-step verification) one week after joining the company. We assembled a great team and went from idea to designs to launch in five weeks across all of our desktop and mobile apps, our website, and our developer APIs. It was really gratifying to see how much a small team could do really quickly.</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_19"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Uber</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Uber is evolving the way the world moves. By seamlessly connecting riders to drivers through their apps, they make cities more accessible, opening up more possibilities for riders and more business for drivers. The product team’s experience runs the gamut of investment banking, management consulting, startups, and working at larger companies such as Amazon and Google.</p><p class="calibre_1">Mina, an Uber PM, talks about what makes PMing at Uber great.</p><blockquote class="calibre_23"><span class="italic">Being an Uber PM is like lifting up the hood of a luxury car. As a user, you just get to enjoy it and you don’t need to think about the mechanics that make it work so smoothly. But, as a PM, you get to lift up the hood and retool the complexity to make it work even better.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">Users can focus on our apps, which is exactly what we want them to do. In contrast, we look across the whole system from what it takes to find you a car to helping our drivers build their businesses. Because we’re so tightly connected to not only our engineers and designers, but also our operational teams, we enjoy a unique role.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_24"><span class="italic">On a day-to-day basis, one thing that stands out as reflective of our culture is our global perspective. After only three years, we’re in over 40 cities and expanding each week to more cities, which means that every single product we build needs to work internationally. We’re also big proponents of workcation - hanging out with your coworkers while building great products in exotic locations, Uber-sponsored. For example, last New Years, we had teams in Melbourne, Miami, Stockholm and Bali ringing in 2013.</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_19"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Airbnb</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Airbnb is a community marketplace for people to list, discover, and book unique accommodations around the world. Airbnb connects people to unique travel experiences, at any price point, in more than 33,000 cities and 192 countries.</p><p class="calibre_1">At Airbnb, product managers are called producers, like a movie producer. As a producer at Airbnb explained:</p><blockquote class="calibre_23"><span class="italic">Think about a movie. As a producer you work with your creative team and the actors and camera and light to hold it all together. At the end of the day, along with the director, you’re responsible for the movie.</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_19">The team of producers is very diverse - along with PMs from the big tech companies, there are also people who came from small startups and people who came from the hospitality industry. This diversity enables Airbnb to build a unique culture. The culture is fundamentally design driven and puts a big emphasis on customer research, called “User Insights.”</p><p class="calibre_1">One thing that really makes Airbnb unique is that it’s a two-sided marketplace (guests and hosts), and a lot of the experience is offline. Producers at Airbnb think about the offline “frames” (another movie-industry reference).</p><p class="calibre_1">Thomas, a producer at Airbnb, shared an example:</p><blockquote class="calibre_23"><span class="italic">You might assume that Airbnb has no impact on how kind and professional our hosts are to their guests since this is part of the travel experience that happens offline. In fact, there is a lot that can be done to help hosts to be exceptional hosts who anticipate their guests’ needs which then results in meaningful trips, unique experiences and, often times, lasting connections between hosts and guests.</span></blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_24"></div>
