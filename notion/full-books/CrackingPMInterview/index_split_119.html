<p id="filepos1044492" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Amazon Leadership Principles</span></span></p><blockquote class="calibre_21">The following leadership principles are reprinted from amazon.com. If you are applying for a job at Amazon, you should definitely read them. They might be useful for other companies as well, since many companies look for similar attributes.</blockquote><p class="calibre_22">Whether you are an individual contributor or the manager of a large team, you are an Amazon leader. These are our leadership principles and every Amazonian is guided by these principles.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Customer Obsession</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Ownership</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job.”</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Invent and Simplify</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here.” As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Are Right, A Lot</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Leaders are right a lot. They have strong business judgment and good instincts.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Hire and Develop the Best</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Insist on the Highest Standards</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Leaders have relentlessly high standards - many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and driving their teams to deliver high quality products, services and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Think Big</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Bias for Action</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Frugality</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">We try not to spend money on things that don’t matter to customers. Frugality breeds resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Vocally Self Critical</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. Leaders come forward with problems or information, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Earn Trust of Others</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Leaders are sincerely open-minded, genuinely listen, and are willing to examine their strongest convictions with humility.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Dive Deep</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, and audit frequently. No task is beneath them.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Deliver Results</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_29">•</li></ul><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_119"></div>
