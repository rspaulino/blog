<p id="filepos234193" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Q &amp; A: Lisa Kostova Ogata, VP of Product at Bright.com</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Tell me a little about your career path.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">I came to product management from a somewhat unorthodox background. I earned a dual degree in international relations and finance from the University of Pennsylvania / Wharton and upon graduation went to work on Wall Street for a few investment management firms.</p><p class="calibre_1">I spent my first five years in private equity and venture capital investing, developing a skillset that in retrospect was very useful in my product management career: evaluating products and teams, figuring out which ones to invest time and resources in, and calculating return on investment. It was great training for a critical mindset and for having to constantly think about tradeoffs and opportunity costs. It was also a good practice ground for communicating hypotheses clearly and succinctly to different audiences.</p><p class="calibre_1">In 2007, I went to Harvard Business School (HBS), where I evolved my goals for what I wanted to do next with my career. I had always known that while I found investing very intellectually stimulating, I was really itching to be part of the creation of products and services—to be hands on.</p><p class="calibre_1">I also got engaged during the first year of business school. Since my fiancé was deeply rooted in the Bay Area, I knew I would be coming back to San Francisco to pursue my career. The explosion of internet companies such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn really captivated me. I spent a lot of time studying them, working with some of them on field projects and in general, getting excited about the space.</p><p class="calibre_1">Between my first and second year at HBS, I interned at Google. Now, Google is one of those companies that have strict educational requirements for their product manager role and they require a CS degree. However, I was fortunate to land an internship in their online sales and operations group. The position was more closely related to a project manager role but I was grateful for it; it gave me great exposure to the company and the space, and it got my foot in the door working in operations in tech.</p><p class="calibre_1">Due to the economic collapse at the end of the summer in 2008, none of the MBA interns at Google got offers. This was a blessing in disguise for a lot of us. It allowed us to be more nimble and creative when pursing career opportunities. Some of my classmates started their own companies; others graduated without an offer.</p><p class="calibre_1">I was part of the latter group. I figured I’d move out to the Bay Area and pound the pavement looking for opportunities with startups and growing companies that didn’t recruit on MBA campuses and needed immediate help.</p><p class="calibre_1">Looking for a job was a roller coaster since I didn’t fit the traditional background of a lot of product management roles at established companies – I had worked in tech for only a few months and people in large organizations were steering me towards the product marketing manager role.</p><p class="calibre_1">After a while, a few of my contacts pointed me towards Zynga. At the time, the company was exploding: Farmville had just launched, and the CEO, Mark Pincus, was a big believer in developing product managers from business backgrounds. The company needed immediate help and they were hiring on potential, not experience. I jumped at the opportunity. After two days full of grueling interviews, I was in.</p><p class="calibre_1">What followed were a few months of late nights and “keep your head down” type of work. It was the toughest boot-camp experience imaginable and I saw a lot of product managers quit within weeks. But I knew I had to stick it out to learn the ropes, and I did.</p><p class="calibre_1">I spent almost four years at Zynga, which was packed with the equivalent of seven to eight years of experience. People used to refer to a year at Zynga as a “dog year” since we were shipping new games, features and products at a record pace I haven’t seen anywhere else.</p><p class="calibre_1">Towards the end of my time at Zynga, I was running a team of a dozen of people and we had built some of Zynga’s most important cross-game channels and products on Facebook. I loved my team and had developed a wonderful relationship with them. Some of them were even teaching me coding on the side.</p><p class="calibre_1">As much as I enjoyed my team, I knew that time was running out for our games on Facebook and that that was a declining market. I started looking around for a new opportunity, which was when I realized what really matters in product management and in any career: relationships. A lot of my former colleagues—engineers I had worked with in several different teams in Zynga—reached out and invited me to work with them in their new ventures. I joined two of my former colleagues at Bright, heading their product team.</p><p class="calibre_1">I continue to learn a great deal at Bright and to work with some amazing and smart people. The company operates in the big data space in a huge market (jobs), which makes it exciting and presents a big opportunity. In addition to several consumer products, I’m also overseeing an enterprise product, which is very different (especially when it comes to interfacing with the sales team and their sales cycle).</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">What do you think has made you successful thus far?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">An open mind, a deep sense of curiosity, and constant desire to learn. You can’t be afraid of going into an area that you don’t know much about – you have to be comfortable getting up to speed quickly in new and potentially intimidating areas. You need to be a consummate and life-long learner. The key is to ask questions, be curious and learn from your team.</p><p class="calibre_1">I always treat engineers, designers and other team members as equal partners, and they explain and teach me about their areas of expertise. My team showed me that coding was not scary, but interesting. It’s built on logic and not nearly as complicated and mathematical as my preconceptions had made it out to be.</p><p class="calibre_1">A sense of curiosity and passion for the product is very important as well, as is developing empathy for the customer – if the PM doesn’t care about the product, it will show in the quality of product in many different ways.</p><p class="calibre_1">As a product manager, you also have to be able to straddle multiple levels and audiences. It’s like speaking different languages (human or computer ones) and being able to relate the message to people in a language that they’ll understand. You need to get your team jazzed and excited about what you’re building, get them to contribute and own their ideas, and also relay and manage communication up to management, sales, legal, etc. – departments that care about different aspects of the product.</p><p class="calibre_1">You need to genuinely like being around people and working with people, bringing their best energy forward. You need to be the type of person who thrives on being in the thick of it, solving problems on the fly, and making decisions quickly without fear. You can’t be the quiet person in the corner who wants to be left alone all day.</p><p class="calibre_1">What this also means is that as a PM, you have to recognize that you will never be the best marketer, or engineer, or sales person. You have to be proficient and versed enough in a lot of these areas and have a good sense of how they fit together in the product. It’s what I imagine being a conductor of an orchestra feels like.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">How valuable is an MBA for product managers?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Getting an MBA just for the sake of getting an MBA is not worthwhile in tech, at least not in Silicon Valley. There are certainly certain industries where it’s a prerequisite –management consulting for example—but tech is not one of them.</p><p class="calibre_1">Having said that, an MBA from a top school is extremely valuable for the network; a lot of my classmates participate in the business and product creation process as founders of companies, venture capitalists and other key players. So I’m organically plugged into a very powerful network that will keep creating and compounding opportunities for my career whatever I decide to do next.</p><p class="calibre_1">The other thing I loved about the MBA is the experience of spending two amazing jam-packed years learning and getting exposed to a variety of companies, industries, and people in a very intellectually stimulating and mind-opening environment. I love learning and I experienced one of my most intense personal growth phases at HBS. But I don’t advertise my MBA or Harvard in my day-to-day job and interactions. Where I work and with what I do, all that matters is your ability to contribute to the success of a company. Some of my smartest colleagues haven’t even gone to college, so educational credentials don’t mean much.</p><p class="calibre_1">An MBA might well be a good path for you, but you need to think carefully about what you’re looking to get out of it and why you would invest the time and money in the experience.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">What advice do you have for people who want to become PMs and advance in their careers?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Be curious and strive to learn something new every day. Learn from the people around you – the marketers, from engineers, from sales people, the QA guys, etc. Without curiosity and an open mind, you’ll get defensive and bitter, and that’s a recipe for hating your life as a PM.</p><p class="calibre_1">Don’t chase a brand. Don’t just go somewhere just because it’s “the” company everyone’s talking about. It’s funny – in the early days at Zynga, a lot of people who would apply to be product managers were the hungry, scrappy kind who had some sort of handicap. Later on, as Zynga became of the hottest pre-IPO companies in 2010 and 2011, there were a lot of people who wanted to apply to be a product manager because they had heard the company was hot and that recruiters liked product managers with Zynga experience.</p><p class="calibre_1">Instead, think about what makes you happy. What is your style – analytical, technical, design-focused, creative? How does it fit with the culture of the organization? Does the product of the company resonate with you? Are you excited to serve the types of customers the company attracts? Do you see yourself working long days with the people you meet during your interviews? Are the problems they are solving exciting to you?</p><p class="calibre_1">Be open minded. Product management is not an obvious and strictly defined role. A lot of companies go by for a long time without product managers and others don’t have that role at all. You don’t have a defined set of buttons to push and levers to pull. You have to be excited, driven, self-<a></a>motivated, and compassionate. You have to be able to pitch in and help where needed – that’s how you carve out your role as PM in a startup.</p><p class="calibre_1">Finally, be able to recognize an opportunity when it shows up. It may be different than what you expect, but if it gets you in the door and one step closer to creating a product, seize it. Be scrappy and trust that it will all eventually work out.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_41"></div>
