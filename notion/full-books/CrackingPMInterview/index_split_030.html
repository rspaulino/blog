<p id="filepos146450" class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Transitioning from Engineer to Product Manager</span></span></p><p class="calibre_11">With all of this emphasis on technical experience, engineers are in a great place to break into product management. As an engineer, you really understand what it takes to build a product and the impact that various tradeoffs can make. You might also have worked with excellent PMs you want to emulate or less-skilled PMs whose mistakes you want to avoid.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Customer Focus</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Customer Focus is the most important thing to develop when moving from engineering to product management. Engineers and developers can usually pick up most of the other important skills on the job, but a customer focus is one of the defining characteristics of good PMs. This means not just thinking of cool ideas, but relentlessly thinking about the target audience, their hopes and dreams, their needs, and how they’re different from you and the other people at your company.</p><p class="calibre_1">One way to build customer focus is to talk to customers of your current product. Ask the PM or Sales team if they will bring you along on their next customer visit; they usually love to bring an engineer along. When they ask for features or tell you what they need, see if you can dig a few levels deeper to get at the underlying motivation. Basically, you’re doing a root cause analysis on the customer’s request.</p><p class="calibre_1">If you can’t directly visit a customer, you can sometimes read, or even volunteer to answer, customer support tickets. Working on the customers’ side and solving their problems can help you build up customer empathy.</p><p class="calibre_1">Writing story-like user scenarios for the features you’re building is another way to develop customer focus. For these scenarios, put yourself in the customer’s shoes and imagine how the feature fits into the rest of their life. It might seem silly, but when you include details about the customer’s mindset, you can build products that fit into their lives better. For example, did Sally really turn on her computer today hoping to update her Flash player? Probably not, so maybe the update should happen quietly in the background.</p><p class="calibre_1">If you’re a backend engineer, you probably don’t interact with people from different functional groups as much. See if you can treat the engineers who build on top of your work like your customers. Do user studies with them and think about their use cases.</p><p class="calibre_1">As you’re preparing for the product manager role, practice describing features from the customer’s point of view by calling out the user-facing benefits. It’s important to talk more like a PM than an engineer if you want to be considered seriously for the role.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Think Big</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Visionary or strategic thinking is another area to focus on when transitioning to product management. As an engineer, you’re probably very focused on what is possible to build. For most of your career, you’ve needed to lower other people’s unrealistic expectations. As a product manager, you need to let go of that instinct and allow yourself to envision a world where you’ve made the impossible happen.</p><p class="calibre_1">Teams need product managers who can lead them into the future, building things that have never been built before. At some point in the development life cycle, you’ll have a chance to scale back, but you need to start big if you want to build a product that will have an impact.</p><p class="calibre_1">It might sound crazy, but for any product or feature you’re working on, think about how it could change the world. If this is hard for you, here are some tips:</p><div class="calibre_15"> </div><ul class="calibre_16"><li value="1" class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre6">See if you can tie the benefits to fundamental human needs like safety, friendship, or self-esteem.</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre_25"><span class="calibre6">Start your brainstorming with the phrase “If I had a magic wand...”</span></li><li value="3" class="calibre_25"><span class="calibre6">Write down your practical objections, then keep going.</span></li><li value="4" class="calibre_25"><span class="calibre6">Find a teammate to play the practical pessimist role in your brainstorming.</span></li><li value="5" class="calibre_25"><span class="calibre6">Write yourself a reminder to always think big.</span></li><li value="6" class="calibre_25"><span class="calibre6">Start your feature planning by writing the press release.</span></li></ul><p class="calibre_1">Allow yourself to dream.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Embrace the persuasive elements of communication</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Many engineers are comfortable in the world of analytical thinking. As an engineer, it’s better to prove things through data than charisma. As a product manager, you need to master both.</p><p class="calibre_1">We’d love to think that all of our coworkers are perfectly logical creatures, but to accomplish things in the real world, you often need to rally the troops and build up some excitement. A spreadsheet with compelling metrics may not open as many doors as a statement like “I’ve looked at all of the numbers and I really believe this is the bet we need to make.”</p><p class="calibre_1">Credibility is the currency of the PM role. Sure, each executive and engineer could look at your spreadsheet and form the same conclusions, but they brought a PM on the team so that they wouldn’t have to. They want you to do the research and propose a solution. It’s your job to cut through the ambiguity to help the team get moving.</p><p class="calibre_1">The more certain you are of the right outcome, the more persuasively you can speak and the more credibility you’re putting on the table. If you end up being right, you gain credibility and can convince the team of bigger things in the future. If you’re wrong, they’ll be less likely to trust you next time.</p><p class="calibre_1">This isn’t to say that you should swing all the way to the side of charisma. Data is often the fastest way to persuade an engineer, and it can be a much more effective approach before you’ve built up your credibility. Just don’t forget that you have multiple tools and you should use them all to be an effective product manager.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Be prepared for some unexpected ways that the PM role is different than Engineering</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">When you think about becoming a product manager, there are some changes that you’re expecting: you won’t be be coding anymore, you’ll be responsible for a lot of decisions, you’ll spend more time in meetings. There are also some parts of being a PM that are less visible.</p><p class="calibre_1">Understanding these differences can mean a smoother transition. Before you make the switch, make sure you have considered the downsides of being a PM. You don’t want to get a job as a product manager only to learn you preferred being an engineer!</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">The work is less tangible</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">In engineering, you get the satisfaction of writing code and seeing it work. As a PM, most of your work doesn’t have such concrete output. Stephen, who switched from a developer to PM, shared that “when you’re a dev you have all these daily successes: my code works, my build passed. As a PM, you have to remember to look for it: I convinced this person, I got the team onboard, and so on.”</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">You become a focus point for criticism</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Ideas can come from anyone on your team. As the PM, you’re responsible for crystallizing those ideas into specifics. While everyone might have liked the idea in the abstract, once it’s solid you’ll start to hear a lot of pushback, no matter how good the design is. As a PM, you need to be able to take that criticism constructively and not personally, and turn it around to make a better product.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">You don’t have time to do it all</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Engineers often get to set their own time estimates and are given time to go deep on a feature. An engineer might spend a whole week working on one part of the code. As a PM, you can’t always spend the time you want on all of your work, so you need to prioritize. This means that some of the time you’ll have to hand over work that’s 30% of what you wanted to do and move on.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Look for openings on your team</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">One common way for engineers to move into product management is to find a role on their current team. It makes sense; your current team already respects you and has seen what you can do, and you have expertise in the area.</p><p class="calibre_1">Daniel, who moved from engineering to product management at Google, found a PM opening on his team. “My team had an open PM role that was very data-oriented, and it wasn’t clear to anyone how to fill it,” he told us. “I knew how to work with data, so I came up as an option. It helped that I had people skills and pre-existing relationships and that I had built up credibility.”</p><p class="calibre_1">Here are some tips for moving into a PM role on your current team:</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">It’s important to let your interests be known.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Find out who would be the hiring manager for the next PM and talk to her. Your team might not currently have room for a PM, but you want to be high on their lists when the position opens up. This also gives you an opportunity to learn what areas she thinks you should focus on improving.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Re-read your prior performance reviews for any potential PM issues.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Have people commented about your being stubborn? About the team never seeming to know what you’re working on until it’s complete (which could signal communication problems)? About wanting to see you take on more leadership on your features? Take steps to address these concerns immediately and to leverage what PM-related strengths are mentioned.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Start taking on some PM work, even without the title.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Maybe there’s a small feature that needs to be spec-ed, or some product decisions you can help make. If your team has PMs, you can offer to help them out. If your team doesn’t have any PMs, look around and see what work you think would be useful.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Take on other types of leadership and coordination work.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">Stephen, who moved from developer to PM on his team at Microsoft, shared this story: “I was the tech lead on a team with two other devs and ran a cross-team collaboration project for my team. We had a messy dependency on another team that was a big risk, so I took on project management for that. I worked with the partner team, and got the dependency straightened out. That established for my team that I could do project management and people thought of me as a leader. Then when I talked to the PM lead about moving onto her team it felt like a natural fit.”</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Think about how to clearly mark the change from engineering to product management.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">It will be hard to be successful as a PM if you’re still handling a lot of engineering responsibilities; you need to pick up some escape velocity. Consider taking time off between the role switch or having some kind of hand off or party to mark the transition. Then you can dive into your new PM role fully.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Find a specialized PM role in your area of expertise</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">As an engineer, you’ve probably picked up some domain expertise around the product you’re working on. Especially if the industry has lots of specialized knowledge, you can use your experience to boost you into a PM role in the industry.</p><p class="calibre_1">Perhaps you’ve been working on security and encryption products. That’s a deeply technical area where your experience as a developer will be a natural value-add.</p><p class="calibre_1">One area where you might have a natural advantage is on developer product or platform products. Since you’ve worked as a developer, you might have insight into how to build a great product for other developers.</p><p class="calibre_1">When you’re going this route, you want to really highlight how your skills and experience can be an asset to the team. Don’t be shy about sharing specific anecdotes and insights about the industry.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Go to Business School</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14">An MBA can help you get a fresh start and round out your engineering background with a business education. Additionally, you’ll have a chance to network with up-and-coming business leaders, work on projects from end to end, potentially launch a startup (or just explore startup ideas), become eligible for MBA internships, and be connected with PM recruiters at the top companies. A developer-turned-MBA-student, particularly from a top MBA program, is very well positioned for PM opportunities.</p><p class="calibre_1">However, an MBA will also cost you lots in tuition money, two years of your life, and even more in lost salary since you’ll need to quit your job for a full-time MBA program. This could be easily over $250,000. Given that investment of time and money, an MBA probably isn’t worth it if you’re solely doing it to get a PM role. There are quicker and cheaper ways to make this transition.</p><p class="calibre_1">Nevertheless, if you’ve been pigeonholed into the engineering role, or you have other reasons for seeking an MBA beyond simply wanting to be a PM, this degree can be valuable.</p><p class="calibre_1">When going the MBA route, pay attention to how business- or marketing-focused you want to be. While all of the big tech companies hire people with MBAs into product management, they vary on how close those PM roles are to the engineers. For example, Microsoft’s product manager role lives firmly under marketing (Microsoft’s program manager role is more equivalent to the product manager role at other companies.) Ask your recruiter questions to make sure you understand the role.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_30"></div>
