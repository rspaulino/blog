<p class="calibre13"><span><span class="italic">Nobel Prize that I received</span></span>: The prize awarded in economics is named Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. It was first given in 1969. Some physical scientists were not pleased with the addition of a Nobel Prize in social science, and the distinctive label of the economics prize was a compromise.</p>

Among the pioneers are Seymour Epstein, Jonathan Evans, Steven Sloman, Keith Stanovich, and Richard West. I borrow the terms System 1 and System 2 from early writings of Stanovich and West that greatly influenced my thinking: Keith E. Stanovich and Richard F. West, “Individual Differences in Reasoning: Implications for the Rationality Debate,” <span><span class="italic">Behavioral and Brain Sciences</span></span> 23 (2000): 645–65.</p>

<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre12"><span class="bold1"><span></span></span><span class="bold1">2: Attention and Effort</span></span></p><div class="calibre16"> </div>
<p class="calibre13"><span><span class="italic">Attention and Effort</span></span>: Much of the material of this chapter draws on my <span><span class="italic">Attention and Effort</span></span> (1973). It is available for free download on my website (<span><span class="calibre98"><a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~kahneman/docs/attention_and_effort/Attention_hi_quality.pdf" class="calibre15">www.princeton.edu/~kahneman/docs/attention_and_effort/Attention_hi_quality.pdf</a></span></span>). The main theme of that book is the idea of a limited ability to pay attention and exert mental effort. Attention and effort were considered general resources that could be used to support many mental tasks. The idea of general capacity is controversial, but it has been extended by other psychologists and neuroscientists, who found support for it in brain research. See Marcel A. Just and Patricia A. Carpenter, “A Capacity Theory of Comprehension: Individual Differences in Working Memory,” <span><span class="italic">Psychological Review</span></span> 99 (1992): 122–49; Marcel A. Just et al., “Neuroindices of Cognitive Workload: Neuroimaging, Pupillometric and Event-Related Potential Studies of Brain Work,” <span><span class="italic">Theoretical Issues in Ergonomics Science</span></span> 4 (2003): 56–88. There is also growing experimental evidence for general-purpose resources of attention, as in Evie Vergauwe et al., “Do Mental Processes Share a Domain-General Resource?” <span><span class="italic">Psychological Science</span></span> 21 (2010): 384–90. There is imaging evidence that the mere anticipation of a high-effort task mobilizes activity in many areas of the brain, relative to a low-effort task of the same kind. Carsten N. Boehler et al., “Task-Load-Dependent Activation of Dopaminergic Midbrain Areas in the Absence of Reward,” <span><span class="italic">Journal of Neuroscience</span></span> 31 (2011): 4955–61.</p>

<p class="calibre13"><span><span class="italic">on the subject’s mind</span></span>: The word <span><span class="italic">subject</span></span> reminds some people of subjugation and slavery, and the American Psychological Association enjoins us to use the more democratic <span><span class="italic">participant</span></span>. Unfortunately, the politically correct label is a mouthful, which occupies memory space and slows thinking. I will do my best to use <span><span class="italic">participant</span></span> whenever possible but will switch to <span><span class="italic">subject</span></span> when necessary.</p>
<p class="calibre13"><span><span class="italic">heart rate increases</span></span>: Daniel Kahneman et al., “Pupillary, Heart Rate, and Skin Resistance Changes During a Mental Task,” <span><span class="italic">Journal of Experimental Psychology</span></span> 79 (1969): 164–67.</p>

We used a halfway mirror so that the observers saw the letters directly in front of them while facing the camera. In a control condition, the participants looked at the letter through a narrow aperture, to prevent any effect of the changing pupil size on their visual acuity. Their detection results showed the inverted-V pattern observed with other subjects.</p>
<p class="calibre13"><span><span class="italic">Much like the electricity meter</span></span>: Attempting to perform several tasks at once may run into difficulties of several kinds. For example, it is physically impossible to say two different things at exactly the same time, and it may be easier to combine an auditory and a visual task than to combine two visual or two auditory tasks. Prominent psychological theories have attempted to attribute all mutual interference between tasks to competition for separate mechanisms. See Alan D. Baddeley, <span><span class="italic">Working Memory</span></span> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1986). With practice, people’s ability to multitask in specific ways may improve. However, the wide variety of very different tasks that interfere with each other supports the existence of a general resource of attention or effort that is necessary in many tasks.</p>

It is the sense of familiarity that protects you from the embarrassment of being (and acting) astonished when you are greeted as an old friend by someone who only looks vaguely familiar.</p>

<p class="calibre13"><span><span class="italic">an intuitive answer to it came readily to mind</span></span>: An alternative approach to judgment heuristics has been proposed by Gerd Gigerenzer, Peter M. Todd, and the ABC Research Group, in <span><span class="italic">Simple Heuristics That Make Us Smart</span></span> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999). They describe “fast and frugal” formal procedures such as “Take the best [cue],” which under some circumstances generate quite accurate judgments on the basis of little information. As Gigerenzer has emphasized, his heuristics are different from those that Amos and I studied, and he has stressed their accuracy rather than the biases to which they inevitably lead. Much of the research that supports fast and frugal heuristic uses statistical simulations to show that they <span><span class="italic">could</span></span> work in some real-life situations, but the evidence for the psychological reality of these heuristics remains thin and contested. The most memorable discovery associated with this approach is the recognition heuristic, illustrated by an example that has become well-known: a subject who is asked which of two cities is larger and recognizes one of them should guess that the one she recognizes is larger. The recognition heuristic works fairly well if the subject knows that the city she recognizes is large; if she knows it to be small, however, she will quite reasonably guess that the unknown city is larger. Contrary to the theory, the subjects use more than the recognition cue: Daniel M. Oppenheimer, “Not So Fast! (and Not So Frugal!): Rethinking the Recognition Heuristic,” <span><span class="italic">Cognition</span></span> 90 (2003): B1–B9. A weakness of the theory is that, from what we know of the mind, there is no need for heuristics to be frugal. The brain processes vast amounts of information in parallel, and the mind can be fast and accurate without ignoring information. Furthermore, it has been known since the early days of research on chess masters that skill need not consist of learning to use less information. On the contrary, skill is more often an ability to deal with large amounts of information quickly and efficiently.</p>

<p class="calibre13"><span><span class="italic">evaluate their happiness</span></span>: A telephone survey conducted in Germany included a question about general happiness. When the self-reports of happiness were correlated with the local weather at the time of the interview, a pronounced correlation was found. Mood is known to vary with the weather, and substitution explains the effect on reported happiness. However, another version of the telephone survey yielded a somewhat different result. These respondents were asked about the current weather before they were asked the happiness quest {ppiournal ofion. For them, weather had no effect at all on reported happiness! The explicit priming of weather provided them with an explanation of their mood, undermining the connection that would normally be made between current mood and overall happiness.</p>

<p class="calibre13"><span><span class="italic">Bayes’s rule</span></span>: The simplest form of Bayes’s rule is in odds form, posterior odds = prior odds × likelihood ratio, where the posterior odds are the odds (the ratio of probabilities) for two competing hypotheses. Consider a problem of diagnosis. Your friend has tested positive for a serious disease. The disease is rare: only 1 in 600 of the cases sent in for testing actually has the disease. The test is fairly accurate. Its likelihood ratio is 25:1, which means that the probability that a person who has the disease will test positive is 25 times higher than the probability of a false positive. Testing positive is frightening news, but the odds that your friend has the disease have risen only from 1/600 to 25/600, and the probability is 4%.</p>
<p class="calibre24">For the hypothesis that Tom W is a computer scientist, the prior odds that correspond to a base rate of 3% are (.03/. 97 = .031). Assuming a likelihood ratio of 4 (the description is 4 times as likely if Tom W is a computer scientist than if he is not), the posterior odds are 4 × . 031 = 12.4. From these odds you can { odes as l compute that the posterior probability of Tom W being a computer scientist is now 11% (because 12.4/112. 4 = .11).</p>

<p class="calibre13"><span><span class="italic">correct answer is 41%</span></span>: Applying Bayes’s rule in odds form, the prior odds are the odds for the Blue cab from the base rate, and the likelihood ratio is the ratio of the probability of the witness saying the cab is Blue if it is Blue, divided by the probability of the witness saying the cab is Blue if it is Green: posterior odds = (.15/.85) × (.80/.20) = .706. The odds are the ratio of the probability that the cab is Blue, divided by the probability that the cab is Green. To obtain the probability that the cab is Blue, we compute: Probability (Blue) = .706/1. 706 = .41. The probability that the cab is Blue is 41%.</p>

Struggling firms tend to turn to outsiders, recruiting CEOs from companies with high recent returns. The incoming CEO then gets credit, at least temporarily, for his new firm’s subsequent improvement. (Mean-while, his replacement at his former firm is now struggling, leading the new bosses to believe that they definitely hired “the right guy.”) Anytime a CEO jumps ship, the new company must buy out his stake (in stock and options) at his old firm, setting a baseline for future compensation that has nothing to do with performance at the new firm. Tens of millions of dollars in compensation get awarded for “personal” achievements that are driven mainly by regression and halo effects (personal communication, December 29, 2009).</p>

<p class="calibre13"><span><span class="italic">kouros</span></span>: The Getty Museum in Los Angeles brings in the world’s leading experts on Greek sculpture to view a kouros—a marble statue of a striding boy—that it is about to buy. One after another, the experts react with what one calls “intuitive repulsion”—a powerful hunch that the kouros is not 2,500 years old but a modern fake. None of the experts can immediately say why they think the sculpture is a forgery. The closest any of them could come to a rationale is an Italian art historian’s complaint that something—he does not know exactly what—“seemed wrong” with the statue’s fingernails. A famous American expert said that the first thought that came to his mind was the word <span><span class="italic">fresh</span></span>, and a Greek expert flatly stated, “Anyone who has ever seen a sculpture coming out of the ground could tell that that thing has never been in the ground.” The lack of agreement on the reasons for the shared conclusion is striking, and rather suspect.</p>

<p class="calibre13"><span><span class="italic">for the rich and for the poor</span></span>: This rule applies approximately to many dimensions of sensation and perception. It is known as Weber’s law, after the German physiologist Ernst Heinrich Weber, who discovered it. Fechner drew on Weber’s law to derive the logarithmic psychophysical function.</p>
<p class="calibre13"><span><span class="italic">$10 million from $100 million</span></span>: Bernoulli’s intuition was correct, and economists still use the log of income or wealth in many contexts. For example, when Angus Deaton plotted the average life satisfaction of residents of many countries against the GDP of these countries, he used the logarithm of GDP as a measure of income. The relationship, it turns out, is extremely close: Residents of high-GDP countries are much more satisfied with the quality of their lives than are residents of poor countries, and a doubling of income yields approximately the same increment of satisfaction in rich and poor countries alike.</p>
<p class="calibre13"><span><span class="italic">“St</span></span>. <span><span class="italic">Petersburg paradox”</span></span>: Nicholas Bernoulli, a cousin of Daniel Bernoulli, asked a question that can be paraphrased as follows: “You are invited to a game in which you toss a coin repeatedly. You receive $2 if it shows heads, and the prize doubles with every successive toss that shows heads. The game ends when the coin first shows tails. How much would you pay for an opportunity to play that game?” People do not think the gamble is worth more than a few dollars, although its expected value is infinite—because the prize keeps growing, the expected value is $1 for each toss, to infinity. However, the utility of the prizes grows much more slowly, which explains why the gamble is not attractive.</p>
<p class="calibre13"><span><span class="italic">“history of one’s wealth”</span></span>: Other factors contributed to the longevity of Bernoulli’s theory. One is that it is natural to formulate choices between gambles in terms of gains, or mixed gains and losses. Not many people thought about choices in which all options are bad, although we were by no means the first to observe risk seeking. Another fact that favors Bernoulli’s theory is that thinking in terms of final states of wealth and ignoring the past is often a very reasonable thing to do. Economists were traditionally concerned with rational choices, and Bernoulli’s model suited their goal.</p>

<p class="calibre13"><span><span class="italic">Rabin’s theorem</span></span>: For several consecutive years, I gave a guest lecture in the introductory finance class of my colleague Burton Malkiel. I discussed the implausibility of Bernoulli’s theory each year. I noticed a distinct change in my colleague’s attitude when I first mentioned Rabin’s proof. He was now prepared to take the conclusion much more seriously than in the past. Mathematical arguments have a definitive quality that is more compelling than appeals to common sense. Economists are particularly sensitive to this advantage.</p>
<p class="calibre13"><span><span class="italic">rejects that gamble</span></span>: The intuition of the proof can be illustrated by an example. Suppose an individual’s wealth is W, and she rejects a gamble with equal probabilities to win $11 or lose $10. If the utility function for wealth is concave (bent down), the preference implies that the value of $1 has decreased by over 9% over an interval of $21! This is an extraordinarily steep decline and the effect increases steadily as the gambles become more extreme.</p>

<p class="calibre13"><span><span class="italic">economists and psychologists</span></span>: Several theorists have proposed versions of regret theories that are built on the idea that people are able to anticipate how their future experiences will be affected by the options that did not materialize and/or by the choices they did not make: David E.

<p class="calibre13"><span><span class="italic">did not own the bottle</span></span>: Technically, the theory allows the buying price to be slightly lower than the selling price because of what economists call an “income effect”: The buyer and the seller are not equally wealthy, because the seller has an extra bottle. However, the effect in this case is negligible since $50 is a minute fraction of the professor’s wealth. The theory would predict that this income effect would not change his willingness to pay by even a penny.</p>
<p class="calibre13"><span><span class="italic">would be puzzled by it</span></span>: The economist Alan Krueger reported on a study he conducted on the occasion of taking his father to the Super Bowl: “We asked fans who had won the right to buy a pair of tickets for $325 or $400 each in a lottery whether they would have been willing to pay $3,000 a ticket if they had lost in the lottery and whether they would have sold their tickets if someone had offered them $3,000 apiece. Ninety-four percent said they would not have bought for $3,000, and ninety-two percent said they would not have sold at that price.” He concludes that “rationality was in short supply at the Super Bowl.” Alan B.

Charles Plott, a leading experimental economist, has been very skeptical of the endowment effect and has attempted to show that it is not a “fundamental aspect of human preference” but rather an outcome of inferior technique. Plott and Zeiler believe that participants who show the endowment effect are under some misconception about what their true values are, and they modified the procedures of the original experiments to eliminate the misconceptions. They devised an elaborate training procedure in which the participants experienced the roles of both buyers and sellers, and were explicitly taught to assess their true values. As expected, the endowment effect disappeared. Plott and Zeiler view their method as an important improvement of technique. Psychologists would consider the method severely deficient, because it communicates to the participants a message of what the experimenters consider appropriate behavior, which happens to coincide with the experimenters’ theory. Plott and Zeiler’s favored version of Kne {ers): tsch’s exchange experiment is similarly biased: It does not allow the owner of the good to have physical possession of it, which is crucial to the effect.

Plott and Kathryn Zeiler, “Exchange Asymmetries Incorrectly Interpreted as Evidence of Endowment Effect Theory and Prospect Theory?” <span><span class="italic">American Economic Review</span></span> 97 (2007): 1449–66.

<p class="calibre13"><span><span class="italic">life as a whole these days</span></span>: Another question that has been used frequently is, “Taken all together, how would you say things are these days? Would you say that you are very happy, pretty happy, or not too happy?” This question is included in the General Social Survey in the United States, and its correlations with other variables suggest a mix of satisfaction and experienced happiness. A pure measure of life evaluation used in the Gallup surveys is the Cantril Self-Anchoring Striving Scale, in which the respondent rates his or her current life on a ladder scale in which 0 is “the worst possible life for you” and 10 is “the best possible life for you.” The language suggests that people should anchor on what they consider possible for them, but the evidence shows that people all over the world have a common standard for what a good life is, which accounts for the extraordinarily high correlation (<span><span class="italic">r</span></span> = .84) between the GDP of countries and the average ladder score of their citizens.

<p class="calibre13"><span><span class="italic">aspects of their lives</span></span>: In posing the question, I was guilty of a confusion that I now try to avoid: Happiness and life satisfaction are not synonymous. Life satisfaction refers to your thoughts and feelings when you think about your life, which happens occasionally—including in surveys of well-being. Happiness describes the feelings people have as they live their normal life.</p>
