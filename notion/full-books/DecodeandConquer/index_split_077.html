<p id="filepos373784" class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre4">What is the DIGS method™?</span></p><p class="calibre_21"><span class="calibre7">Dramatize the situation</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Imagine this imaginary conversation with a Fortune 500 CEO:</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="italic">ME: What did you do today?</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="italic">CEO: I wrote some emails. I went some meetings. And I yelled at some people.</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="italic">ME: Oh, guess what, I did same exact thing. Emails, meetings, and yelled people. I guess I can do your job.</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="italic">CEO: No, no, no. You don’t get it. When I was writing some emails, I wrote to John Doe, our chief legal counsel. John is trying to fight a $2 billion dollar, anti-trust fine from the European Union. When I was meeting with someone, I was meeting with Jane Doe, CEO of Silicon Valley’s hottest tech start-up, to discuss whether they should renew their 10 year advertising partnership worth $10 billion dollars. When I yelled at some people…</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="italic">ME: Ah, I guess I can’t do your job.</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">The key take away: context and details matter. If we reduce our jobs to the core elements, it’s just a bunch of emails and meetings. Dramatize the situation and help us understand why your job, project, or product is important.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre7">Indicate the alternatives</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">This is an optional step, but if you can do it, you’ll be a rock star. When I think about behavioral interviews, it’s about problem solving. You’re solving problems with people, products, processes, etc.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Any good problem solver knows that there’s more than one way to solve a problem. So why not describe all the alternative solutions?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Without the alternatives, the listener just might think to him or herself: “What’s so special about that? I would have done it the same exact way.” Candidates can’t settle for being normal. This is the interview. Candidates need to stand out from others. They need to be special.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">The use of alternatives uses the same theatrical device as dramatizing the situation: it helps us appreciate why what you did was so important.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">In general, you’d want to list three different alternatives. One alternative is not enough. Two is better. Three feels complete. But more than three is not necessary; the listener will feel overwhelmed.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">And one more thing, talk about the pros and cons of each of the three approaches. You’ll be perceived as thoughtful and analytical, which traits they’ll look for in top product managers.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre7">Go through what you did</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Drop us off in the front lines of action. Give us the details of what you did. Who did you call? What did you ask them to do? How did they respond? What kind of resistance did you get?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">By putting the listener in your shoes, you convince us that you were the front-line owner and driving, not a participant who was lingering in the back-row, several steps removed from the core action and the results.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre7">Summarize the impact</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Conclude your story by summarizing the impact. Without a summary, you’ll leave the listener with the <span class="italic">So What?</span> feeling. Show the listener that your actions benefited the business’ bottom line.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Clean, crisp numbers make a big impact. Did your project reduce costs by 5% or increase revenue by $100 million? Yes, those numbers are hard to recall. I barely remember what happened last week. And if you don’t remember if the revenue increase was $1 or $100 million, estimate the impact, if you must.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">If there are instances where you’ve racked your brain and can’t come up with a reasonable (estimated) number, a qualitative statement could work too. It could be a quote from a senior executive who thought you executed the smoothest product launch that he’s seen in last five years. It could be a testimonial from a customer who said it was the most innovative feature that your company delivered in 20 years.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Either way, a qualitative statement that validates your impact can be just as good.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_77"></div>
