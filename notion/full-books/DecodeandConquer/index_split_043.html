For products that are creating brand new categories, this is the price of building a particular product from scratch. For products that compete in existing categories, this is the competitors’ price plus an additional accessories or customizations necessary to achieve parity with the competition.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">In the real world, the best way to finalize price is to try different price points. Out of all retailers, Amazon is known to be most aggressive in varying its price over time, finding the optimal balance between price and volume.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">What is you can’t run real-time price experiments like Amazon? You can survey customers instead. But note that surveys can lead to overly optimistic predictions on price points and volume. You’ll have to take that data and adjust accordingly to have a more accurate assessment.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_43"></div>
