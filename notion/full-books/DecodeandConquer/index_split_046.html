Now, most Agile product development processes rely on A/B experimentation instead of crude human judgment to make decisions. (For quick background, Agile product development emphasizes iterative development rather than determining requirements upfront and building the product in a single, final release.) Product managers are leading the charge with A/B testing: developing new features and hypotheses on what will improve product performance, evaluating test results, and making ship or no-ship decisions on new releases.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">The metrics interview reflects this new reality. Interviewers routinely ask individuals what metrics they would evaluate to understand success of a product, how they would interpret test results and what actions they would take based on the data.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">The interviewer is assessing whether the candidate understands metrics that relate to the overall business goal and whether they can drive the A/B testing process.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_46"></div>
