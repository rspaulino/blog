It’s important for three reasons:</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="bold">Thinking big</span>. Many product management candidates default to “me too” innovation. That is, a social network should be designed like Facebook, and a mobile phone should look like an Apple iPhone.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">However, given the barriers to entry, it is unlikely users will switch to a competitive product that’s simply a clone of the market leader. Users will only switch if a product is better. And that type of improvement comes only when the product leaders think big.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="bold">Influence and morale</span>. Product managers lead teams. Product managers are more likely to get things done through a team if he or she can communicate a product goal that’s innovative.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="bold">Credibility.</span> A good vision is one that’s aggressively big. However, at the same time, it’s seemingly doable. In May 1961, President John F. Kennedy proclaimed:</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">"First, I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth. "</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">It was a grand vision. No man or animal had been to the moon and back. But it was seemingly doable. The previous month, John Glenn, had been the first American to venture to and from space. So this idea of going to the moon — seemed both attainable and worth fighting for, despite an aggressive timeline.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_64"></div>
