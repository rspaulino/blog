Sometimes, there are some dollar items available for sale, but definitely not the breadth that I’d see at a brick and mortar dollar store. Other times, I would see dollar store items such as baking soda, get marked up 400 percent by Amazon’s marketplace vendors.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">With the new add on program, Amazon clearly recognizes that selling low-priced items can be profitable; they just can’t be profitable (or provide sufficient customer value) when they’re being sold and shipped on its own.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">The dollar store would work under the “fill your bag” principle. That is, buy enough $1 items to fill a minimum quantity, and you’ll get Amazon’s free super saver shipping. By aggregating several $1 items in a single shipment, Amazon can make these dollar items profitable.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><hr class="calibre_32"/><p class="calibre_16"><span class="bold">Comments: This is a very difficult question because Amazon carries almost every physical good.

Which one do you choose and why?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: My understanding of the scenario is that I’m an Amazon category manager, responsible for the kitchen category. I have to choose which new product to carry—a new oven or oven mitt.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: Yes, that’s correct. You have to make the tough decision of choosing just one.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: Let me walk you through how I would frame the issue and then dive into the details.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: Sounds good.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: So there are three criteria I think about when stocking a new product.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="italic">Candidate writes the following on the whiteboard:</span></p><div class="calibre_10"> </div><ul class="calibre_20"><li value="1" class="calibre_19"><span class="italic">Profitability</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre_19"><span class="italic">Customer satisfaction</span></li><li value="3" class="calibre_19"><span class="italic">Product assortment</span></li></ul><p class="calibre_8">CANDIDATE: To begin, profitability is straightforward. Usually it doesn’t make sense to go through the effort, cost, and time to stock a product if we’re not going to make money off of it.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Secondly, customer satisfaction is important for two reasons. The first is that we want customers to have a good experience. Customers will be disappointed if they can’t find a product. This affects net promoter customer satisfaction metric.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Moreover, Amazon should recommend high quality products. Amazon wouldn’t want to endorse, let alone carry, products that either don’t work as advertised or don’t provide reasonable value to customers.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Third, product assortment is crucial, especially as it relates to corporate strategy and branding. Amazon’s value proposition is product assortment. Amazon started by promoting itself as the world’s largest bookstore and now, rightfully so, the world’s largest store, period.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">If customers expect Amazon to stock a particular item and that item weren’t available, Amazon’s brand equity would be damaged. It would affect customers’ desire to come back in the future as well as their willingness to recommend Amazon to friends. I know Amazon doesn’t spend a lot on traditional marketing, choosing instead to let consumer experience speak for itself; so a negative customer experience would be detrimental.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Is there anything missing from my decision-making framework?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: I can’t think of anything else from the top of my head.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="italic">Candidate writes on the whiteboard:</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><table valign="top" class="calibre_26"><tr valign="top" class="calibre_27"><th valign="top" class="calibre_28">     </th><th valign="top" class="calibre_28">  <span class="bold">Oven  </span>

Let’s start with the qualitative ones first—customer satisfaction and product assortment.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: Okay. Does Amazon carry any ovens today?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: No. We carry small toasters, but we do not carry large kitchen ovens. Why do you think that is?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: My hypothesis is that consumers aren’t comfortable buying large appliances online. They are used to going to Sears, Best Buy, and Home Depot to buy appliances in person. However, I do think the world is changing. I bought a kitchen oven 3 months ago, and I bought it from Best Buy’s website after seeing listed for more at Home Depot.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: Ah, showrooming.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: Yes.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: Aside from consumer behavior, why else would Amazon not carry kitchen ovens?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="italic">Candidate thinks for a moment.</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: I can come up with two more reasons why Amazon doesn’t carry kitchen ovens today. First, because of its bulky nature, a kitchen oven isn’t easy to deliver, especially in Amazon’s highly optimized fulfillment operation that had its roots in delivering more manageable items, such as books, DVDs, and movies.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: Correct. What else?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: Amazon might also not sell ovens because that is more a solution-sell, not a product-sell.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: Sounds like jargon to me. What does “solution-sell” mean?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: Well, the customer is not just buying an oven; he wants a working oven. To sell a working oven, Amazon would also have to provide installation services as part of the sell. Home Depot and Best Buy have developed relationships with local service providers who can not only deliver kitchen ovens, but have the expertise to install them, too. Amazon would have to develop those business relationships on a nationwide scale.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: Based on your findings, what would you put in the customer satisfaction section of your scorecard, for the new oven?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: I would put “decrease” customer satisfaction. We could carry ovens and make them available for sale. However, we wouldn’t be able to fulfill customers in the quick manner that they expect from Amazon. Also, we’d have a hard time offering the services that go along with the big appliance purchase from Day 1.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: Sounds good. We’re running short on time. I want us to cover one last thing before we move onto the next question.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: Sure.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: I’d like you to calculate the expected profits from carrying the oven mitt.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: You want an actual number estimate?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: Yes.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: And when you say profits, do you mean annual or lifetime?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: Annual.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: I’ll talk about my approach and then we’ll go into some back-of-the-envelope calculations. I’ll start off with looking at the potential customer base, the likelihood of purchasing an oven mitt at Amazon, the frequency of purchase, and the propensity to purchase a particular model. And of course, I’ll also factor in the profit margin.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: Sounds good.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: Last time I checked there are 315 million people in the US. I’m going to guess there are roughly 2. 5 people per household. To save time, we’ll round the numbers to 300 million and three, respectively. This will give us 100 million households.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Most households need one oven mitt. There are some that need more than one, but let’s say one is sufficient.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">For this year, there are two customer segments that would be interested in oven mitts. The first customer segment is households that have never owned an oven mitt. The second customer segment is households that want to replace an oven mitt.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Let’s start with the first segment. Those who are starting households are usually new college grads. If we assume a uniform distribution along with a 70-year life expectancy, we’ll get:</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="italic">Candidate writes down:</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="italic">300 million people / 70 year life expectancy = 4.3 million new people starting a household each year</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: Of those 4.3 million people, not everyone will get an oven mitt. Some think they need it, some don’t. Some have one from mom and dad. What’s a reasonable assumption for percentage of new grads that need an oven mitt?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: Go with 60.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="italic">Candidate writes down:</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="italic">4.3MM * 60% = 2.6 million</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: Okay, that’s 2.6 million people who are going to buy the oven mitt.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Next calculation: what percent buy from Amazon? What do you think is Amazon’s market share of oven mitt purchases?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: What do you think it is?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: It seems that most people buy housewares from Target and other big box retailers, so I’d say it’s less than 5 percent. However, younger people like buying through Amazon, especially with free shipping and Prime; so I’d go with a higher number, like 15 percent.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: Sure.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="italic">Candidate writes down:</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="italic">2.6 million * 15 percent = 390k</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: Of those 390 thousand people, I’ll assume they only need one oven mitt. For these folks, how many would buy this particular oven mitt? Is there anything special about the oven mitt that leads us to believe that it would get a disproportionate number of sales?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: Initial tests show that it outsells the average oven mitt by 3:1.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: How many oven mitts do you carry?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: 2,000.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="italic">Candidate writes down:</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="italic">390k / 2k = 195 units per average mitt</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="italic">195 avg. units * 3 = 585 units sold for this mitt, per year</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: So we’re expected to sell 585 mitts this year.

Based on what you know, does it make sense to carry the oven mitt?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: Amazon already carries 2,000 mitts, so it’s hard to argue that customers are unsatisfied with the current set of choices or find the product selection lacking.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">The $2,340 in annual profits is nice, but there may be some cannibalization.
