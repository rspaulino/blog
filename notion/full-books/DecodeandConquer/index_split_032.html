<p id="filepos146509" class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4"> Answers</span></p><p id="filepos146584" class="calibre_21"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold"> Assume you are the new product manager in our Amazon Prime business and are in charge of feature development. What data would you look at to develop new features? What new features would they be?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: Before we jump into the question, do you mind if I clarify my understanding of Amazon Prime, especially the service and the benefits to both the customer and to Amazon’s overall business.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: Sure.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: I understand that Amazon Prime is a membership club. Amazon Prime members get free two-day shipping for every order they place. They can also stream movies &amp; TV shows for free and borrow books from the Kindle library.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Correct me if I’m wrong, I believe the biggest benefit for Prime members is shipping. Normally, free super saver shipping takes five to eight days to arrive. Two day shipping is a big improvement. By making it available to all orders, Amazon Prime’s two-day shipping benefit likely reduces indecision around whether to upgrade from Free Super Saver to a one-time shipping upgrade.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">I've heard Amazon Prime helps the business because:</p><div class="calibre_10"> </div><ul class="calibre_20"><li value="1" class="calibre_19">Customers order more frequently.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_19">Customers spend more.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_19">Customers buy products that they wouldn't otherwise buy at Amazon.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_19">It leverages Amazon's competitive advantage, an ultra-fast fulfillment process.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_19">Customers have high satisfaction.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_19">It steals wallet share from competitors.</li></ul><p class="calibre_8">Okay, so back to the question. If I were to develop new features, I’d start with our business goal. What are we trying to achieve? Our goal can include any of the aforementioned metrics:</p><div class="calibre_10"> </div><ul class="calibre_20"><li value="1" class="calibre_19">Increase sales per Prime customer</li><li value="2" class="calibre_19">Increase in the number of Prime customers</li><li value="3" class="calibre_19">Increase Prime customer satisfaction</li></ul><p class="calibre_8">Let's say the goal is to increase the number of new Prime customers. I've heard that Amazon has approximately 30 million customers, with anywhere from 5 to 30 percent opted into the Prime program.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">We would need to investigate why regular Amazon customers won't try Amazon Prime. It could be for several reasons:</p><div class="calibre_10"> </div><ul class="calibre_20"><li value="1" class="calibre_19">They aren’t aware of it.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_19">They aren’t interested or don’t see the value in it.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_19">They are interested but not willing to make the effort.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_19">They tried it, but aren’t compelled to pay for it.</li></ul><p class="calibre_8">Based on your knowledge, what's the primary reason why customers don't try Amazon Prime?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: 65 percent of Amazon customers are aware of Amazon Prime, but only half of that group has paid for it. The reason they haven’t paid: they didn’t find the value proposition compelling.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: Thanks for the insight. Unless you disagree, let's assume that marketing is not the reason why there's not enough interest. Putting that out of scope allows us to focus on our discussion on developing new product and program features.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: Okay.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: When it comes to developing new features, I'd like to see data on customer's top pain points with his or her Amazon shopping experience. Then we’ll construct new Prime features to address the top pain point. Off the top of my head, I feel these are the top Amazon customer pain points:</p><div class="calibre_10"> </div><ul class="calibre_20"><li value="1" class="calibre_19">Can't find the product I need</li><li value="2" class="calibre_19">Not a bargain</li><li value="3" class="calibre_19">Not timely</li><li value="4" class="calibre_19">Too much of a hassle to buy online</li></ul><p class="calibre_8">Okay, I'll go ahead with that “can’t find the product I need” use case. Give me a moment to brainstorm some ideas.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="italic">Candidate takes 60 seconds to brainstorm</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: I have a few features in mind to solve that problem:</p><div class="calibre_10"> </div><ul class="calibre_20"><li value="1" class="calibre_19">Personal shopper</li><li value="2" class="calibre_19">Free return shipping</li><li value="3" class="calibre_19">Product perks club</li></ul><p class="calibre_8">Personal shopper gives each Prime member customized help when shopping for products. They provide customized gift ideas, research products and help navigate Amazon’s seemingly endless database. Customer satisfaction and purchases are likely to go up — even for existing Prime members. The downside is that this concierge service would be costly.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Free return shipping gives an assurance that if they buy the wrong product they can easily return it later, without incurring additional shipping costs. This may lead to new Prime customers, but it also increases costs for not only new Prime customers but also old Prime customers.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Product perks club is a special club where customers are invited to sample or test products and write reviews. This introduces the Prime member to new products and makes them feel special. The cost may be partially subsidized by manufacturers, who may want to get their products in front of Amazon customers.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Of all the feature ideas presented, I feel that product perks club has the best benefits and also has minimal cost. Customers and advertisers will like it. The costs could be manageable, especially if subsidized by advertisers.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">However, the feature that could have the most impact is the free return shipping. The inability to return is what I feel is a big barrier to driving more purchases from brick-and-mortar to online. Free return shipping could lead to a significant group of new Amazon Prime customers.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><hr class="calibre_32"/><p class="calibre_16"><span class="bold">Comments: The candidate gives a good response that indicates a solid understanding of the product, why adoption is low and what suggestions would improve adoption. However, the candidate doesn’t explicitly cite the metrics he would look at. He suggests some features, which don’t appear to be too creative. For instance, one of the ideas, Products Perks Club, sounds a little too similar to Amazon’s Vine program, which makes new and pre-release products available to top Amazon reviewers. The reviewers get to keep those new products after reviewing them.</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p id="filepos154645" class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold"> The billboard industry is under monetized. How can Google create a new product or offering to address this?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: Okay, you want me to design a new product that will change the billboard industry. Analyzing why the billboard industry is under monetized is out of scope, correct?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: You got it.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="italic">Candidate writes on the whiteboard</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="italic">Customer problems</span></p><div class="calibre_10"> </div><ul class="calibre_20"><li value="1" class="calibre_19"><span class="italic">Ads are irrelevant</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre_19"><span class="italic">Ads are static</span></li><li value="3" class="calibre_19"><span class="italic">Ads have poor recall</span></li></ul><p class="calibre_8">CANDIDATE: Okay, I always start with the user. In this case, it’s the commuter who sees the billboards. There are a couple of challenges:</p><div class="calibre_10"> </div><ol class="calibre_18"><li value="1" class="calibre_19">First, not all billboards are relevant. When I drive up and down the 101, there are many billboards focused on technology enterprises. These billboards aren’t relevant to all commuters.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_19">Second, billboards don’t change. There’s a missed opportunity to add more information on a billboard, especially if a user is stuck in traffic and has time to read more.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_19">Third, it’s hard to remember the contents of a billboard. If I want to research or follow-up on the advertised company, it’s tough. The web address, phone number, even the name—these are things I’d like to remember, but can’t because I’m focused on driving.</li></ol><p class="calibre_8">INTERVIEWER: How would you solve these problems?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: Give me a moment to brainstorm.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="italic">30 second pause</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: Let’s start with the second use case. We can upgrade the billboards to rotate through different ads. There are electronic billboards today, but I’ve found the ad rotation is typically limited. Google can expand the ad rotation by:</p><div class="calibre_10"> </div><ul class="calibre_20"><li value="1" class="calibre_19"><span class="bold">Bring new advertisers</span><span class="italic">.</span> Introduce its advertisers to billboard advertising, a new platform for many.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_19"><span class="bold">Introduce new ad formats and layouts</span>, including multiple ads on a single billboard.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_19"><span class="bold">Offer a real-time ad auction system</span><span class="italic">.</span> I presume that billboard ads are sold on a monthly basis, which limits ad competition and variety. By allowing advertisers to compete for ad space in real-time, it would increase the ads available for rotation.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_19"><span class="bold">Offer targeting opportunities</span></li></ul><p class="calibre_8">INTERVIEWER: What kind of targeting opportunities would you offer?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: Obvious targeting options include location, time of day and day of week. Target could get more advanced. We could target based on weather or traffic patterns. Just imagine an ad that’s relevant: “Stay in this traffic and get back home by 8p. m. Get a $10 day pass at 24 Hour Fitness, work out, let the traffic die down and you’ll get home by 8:30p. m.”</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: How would the real-time ad auction work?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: This would be similar to how Google AdWords and online ad exchanges work. Give advertisers the opportunity to bid on every single impression available in Google’s inventory. By making bidding real-time, it allows advertisers pay more for targeted impressions that count and less for impressions that don’t.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: Okay, how about the other two use cases?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: For the first use case, advertising relevancy, the aforementioned targeting options will make more advertising more relevant. But I feel Google can take it one step further.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">For example, Google has developed a core competence around computer vision through Google’s driverless cars. It’s not a stretch for Google to adapt computer vision to recognize cars on the road. For instance, it can detect a Black Lexus SUV or recognize letters on a license plate.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Based on that data, Google can show an ad appropriate to that driver or cluster of drivers. For example, a group of commuters who drive luxury cars are more likely to respond to an ad about an exotic Mediterranean vacation.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: Unique idea, but wouldn’t that be controversial?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: You mean target ads based on a license plate number?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: Yes.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: I agree that there are privacy implications and that’s something that would have to be researched. We would have to develop well thought out talking points before the feature goes to market.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: Okay, how about the third use case?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: We could create a billboard search engine to help commuters recall billboards. Users can enter a company name and location. Or we could make it more advanced. Perhaps users can browse through a shortlist of billboard ads based on the user’s recent travels, garnered from smartphone GPS chip data. Or perhaps we can offer a voice-recognition feature on smartphones to bookmark billboards during a drive.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">These recall solutions aren’t perfect, but they’re better than other ideas I’ve considered which include asking the user to take a picture of the billboard as well as memorize a website or offer code. Those ideas are either too difficult or distracting for the user who is driving.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><hr class="calibre_32"/><p class="calibre_16"><span class="bold">Comments: Our candidate offers an excellent response. He starts by recounting user challenges in detail. He thinks big by offering ideas like targeted advertising based on car make and model as well as license plate. It has the makings of a big idea: unique, memorable, seemingly far fetched, but upon further explanation seems plausible. Overall, his response is very creative and thoughtful.</span></p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_32"></div>
