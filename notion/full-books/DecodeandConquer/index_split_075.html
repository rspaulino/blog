<p id="filepos366924" class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre4">What Interviewers Are Looking For</span></p><p class="calibre_21">For an ideal response, interviewers are looking for two things: credibility and likability. For credibility, they’re assessing whether you have the competence to do the job. Here are some factors they want to see in your response:</p><div class="calibre_10"> </div><ul class="calibre_20"><li value="1" class="calibre_19"><span class="bold">Owner vs. participant</span>. In today’s cross-functional organizations, many interview candidates claimed they led a big project or delivered big results. However, if you dig a bit deeper, you’ll find the candidate played a marginal role. Or the candidate may have participated in portions of the project, not the entire thing. To uncover the truth, savvy interviewers will ask follow-up questions including who was involved, what you personally did, and how you did it. It may feel uncomfortable to receive 20 questions on a particular experience, but I have found that it is your benefit to play along. It will more quickly answer the doubts that percolate in the interviewer’s mind.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_19"><span class="bold">Good vs. great achievement</span>. Interview candidates are clever. They realize that including numbers into their resumes and interview responses sound more impressive. But even savvier interviewers will want to determine why it was considered a great vs. good achievement. And they want to know whether the results were largely due to your impact, or if those results would have occurred even without your involvement. Expect the interviewer ask follow up questions on baseline metrics such as “How much growth did you see last year?” or “What was the projected increase had you decided not to invest in a new feature?”</li></ul><p class="calibre_8">We’ve established your talent by choosing and delivering stories that demonstrate your exceptional experiences, skills, and impact. But likability is the other critical piece to the behavioral interview. It’s equally important to develop chemistry or rapport with the interviewer.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Interviewers like to advocate candidates that remind them of themselves. They see themselves as talented and entertaining. For interviewers who potentially interview 2-3 candidates a week, nothing can be more tedious than a candidate who can’t find a punch line in their responses or talk about their past experiences with the same excitement as watching paint dry.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Not every candidate is a comedian, so I’m not going to press or even encourage you to tell jokes if that doesn’t come naturally to you. But you do have to be entertaining and more importantly, earn the listener’s full attention.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Your goal is to tell stories in a way that has the listener on the edge of their seat, eager to hear more. To achieve this goal, shift your mindset. Tell your stories like a world-class storyteller. Think of your favorite storyteller. It could be J. K. Rowling, Stephen King, or Steven Spielberg. Thinking through the basics of a satisfying story, there are three key elements:</p><div class="calibre_10"> </div><ul class="calibre_20"><li value="1" class="calibre_19"><span class="bold">Colorful characters and settings</span>. People (and places) have names. Characters have motivations, perspectives and emotions. You’re at the center of the story, so you’ll be the hero. And every hero has a villain. To summarize, don’t forget the who, what, why, how and when of what you’re describing.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_19"><span class="bold">Conflict</span>. Every good story has conflict that needs to be resolved. For instance, Superman can choose to save 100 million people from a flaming meteor in New York City or his girlfriend, Lois Lane, in Des Moines, Iowa. Life is about dilemmas, trade-offs, and tough decisions. Good conflicts include unreasonable constraints, impossible deadlines, and Earth-shattering consequences.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_19"><span class="bold">Resolution.</span> Every story has to be complete. That is, it has to have a satisfying end where the conflict ends. More often than not, the hero wins. But other times, the hero doesn’t win. In those circumstances, there are valuable lessons from a loss that needs to be articulated to the listener.</li></ul><p class="calibre_8">Just because you’re discussing a career experience, it doesn’t mean you have to recount your career with the same humdrum delivery as a corporate status meeting.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">One more tip: every story has a natural progression that covers the beginning, middle, and end. Don’t leave the listener wondering: how did it all start? Or make the interviewer think: did you defeat your foe eventually?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_75"></div>
