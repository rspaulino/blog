Here are some classic favorites:</p><div class="calibre_10"> </div><ul class="calibre_20"><li value="1" class="calibre_19">How many golf balls can fit a school bus?</li><li value="2" class="calibre_19">How much does a 747 weigh?</li></ul><p class="calibre_8">Look past the wacky packaging; estimation questions have real world practicality. Product managers make decisions all the time: whether to respond to a customer complaint on feature A vs. B or how many servers to order for a new service. It’s a judgment call and that judgment is based on the product manager’s estimate of a metric.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Interviewers also use estimation questions to evaluate your listening and problem solving skills. They’re seeing whether or not you can identify critical assumptions and your judgment in choosing assumptions. It wouldn’t make sense if I claimed that a 747 weighs 1,000 pounds, would it?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">There are two ways to answer estimation questions: top down and bottoms up.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_37"></div>
