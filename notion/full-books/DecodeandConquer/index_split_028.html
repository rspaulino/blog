Increase revenue?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: Your boss is the owner of a garage door company. Garage doors haven’t really evolved much over the last few decades. He feels a redesign of the garage door opener could lead to differentiation and more market share for the company.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: I’ll start by exploring the user problems. When I think about the problems, a few come to mind:</p><div class="calibre_10"> </div><ol class="calibre_18"><li value="1" class="calibre_19">The garage door opens slowly. Maybe it doesn’t take this long, but it feels like it takes 10-15 seconds to open or close.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_19">Sometimes, I’m not sure if the garage door closed. When I’m away from home, there’s that nagging feeling that it might still be open.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_19">Lastly, the garage door opener is an extra device. I feel like I should be able to open and close the garage door with the device I do carry with myself all the time, my smartphone.</li></ol><p class="calibre_8">I’d like to brainstorm a couple of solutions.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">The first idea addresses use case number 3. That is, open your garage door using your smartphone. The garage door could be connected to a wireless network, and a smartphone app could automatically open and close the garage door. The benefit is that the user no longer needs an extra electronic device to open the garage door. The downside is that this wouldn’t serve those that don’t have smartphones. Good news is that American smartphone penetration is nearly 60 percent and growing. Another downside is smartphone connectivity might not be reliable. The local wireless network and cellular data introduces additional points of failure.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">The second idea addresses use case number 2. Provide an SMS, email or in-app confirmation on whether the garage door closed. The app could also monitor the state of the garage door and provide alerts when the garage door is open. This will be especially valuable, especially during times when the garage door should be closed, such as during the working day. There are no true cons to this idea; it’s better than constant worrying or waiting 10-15 seconds for the garage door to close before leaving the house.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">The third idea addresses use case number 1. We could include a timer function where the garage door would automatically open at preset times and days. While this alleviates the “waiting for 10-15 seconds” problem, this could be an issue, especially when it opens on days when it doesn’t need to be open. Or it automatically closes when a child is underneath. It seems better to simply have the garage door open and close on demand.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: Okay, so what would you recommend?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: I would recommend doing ideas number 1 and 2.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><hr class="calibre_32"/><p class="calibre_16"><span class="bold">Comments: The candidate does a good job of clarifying the objective and the situation.
