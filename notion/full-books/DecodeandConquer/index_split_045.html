I’m not familiar with the tablet market. Do I mind if ask you a few questions?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: Sure, go ahead.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: Who are its main competitors?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: The main competitors are the iPad Mini, Samsung Galaxy Tab, and Google’s Nexus 7.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: How much do those retail for?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: The iPad Mini retails for $329 while the Galaxy Tab and Nexus 7 sell for $199.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: What makes Kindle Fire HD standout from its competition?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: Kindle Fire HD has a higher resolution than the Galaxy Tab and iPad Mini.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">My last question: How much does it cost to make a Kindle Fire HD?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">I can’t release internal data. However, a market research firm, iSuppli, disassembled a Kindle Fire HD and publicly estimated that each Kindle Fire HD costs $174 to make.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: Thanks for the background information. There are three different ways we can look at pricing.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="italic">Candidate writes on the board</span></p><div class="calibre_10"> </div><ul class="calibre_20"><li value="1" class="calibre_19"><span class="italic">Customer’s willingness to pay</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre_19"><span class="italic">Competitive pricing</span></li><li value="3" class="calibre_19"><span class="italic">Cost-based pricing</span></li></ul><p class="calibre_8">CANDIDATE: First, I’d think about the customer. If they didn’t have the product, what would they do instead? How much they would pay for an alternative or substitute product? Negotiators call this the BATNA or the best alternative to a negotiated agreement. Here, I’ll call it the customer’s willingness to pay for the product. It represents the maximum a customer would pay for the product.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">In this case, if a customer couldn’t buy a Kindle Fire HD, the best alternative device is the Nexus 7. It has specifications, especially screen resolution, that’s most similar to the Fire HD. The Nexus 7 costs $199, so that likely is the most we could charge for the Kindle Fire HD.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Next, we look at Kindle Fire HD’s unit cost of $174. We can add an absolute or relative markup to the unit’s final price. Knowing how strategic the Fire HD is to selling additional digital content, it’s possible that Amazon could pursue the “razor and razor blade” strategy. That is, sell the Kindle Fire HD at, or below, cost, and make its profits on future digital content sales. Given this, let’s say the pricing lower bound could be $174.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Then, we compare prices with what’s already on the market. The Nexus 7 and the Galaxy Tab are selling for $199.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Finally, we should evaluate supply and demand. Limited supply and high demand might merit a higher price point while the inverse might merit the reverse. To build a demand curve, we can test different price points. From that data, we can extrapolate the right price to maximize overall product profits.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: So what’s your recommendation?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: Given the urgency, there’s no time to experiment and derive a supply and demand curve. Based on the discussion, we’ve got a tight pricing bound from $174 to $199. I would recommend the low end of the pricing spectrum, $174. Amazon needs to protect its core business of selling books, music, and movies. In the digital world, iTunes and Google Play can sell books. By ceding control of the platform, the tablet, Amazon will find it hard to compete. It’s more important that Amazon wins market share now and create a strong distribution footprint of tablets. Using the Kindle Fire HD as a loss leader, Amazon can generate profits on future sales of digital content.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><hr class="calibre_32"/><p class="calibre_16"><span class="bold">Comments: Candidate used an easy-to-follow pricing framework. The interviewer perceived the candidate to be an expert. It’s not feasible to build supply and demand curves in the interview, but the acknowledgment is important. It was also good that the candidate recommended a specific price. Other candidates may have fallen short and refused to commit. It may come as a surprise that the candidate can ask for so much background information. But he must because he doesn’t know much about the tablet market or the price points. It would be lethal to answer based on assumptions and be criticized for a wrong detail.</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p id="filepos228510" class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold"> Assume you are the new product manager in our Amazon Prime business and are deciding pricing. The vice president would like to lower the price from $79.99 per year to $69.99 per year. Making your own assumptions, develop the financial projections for this decision.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: With lower prices, customer demand will increase. The new Prime customers might also purchase more things. However, increased demand will reduce membership revenues from existing Prime customers and increase shipping costs for existing non-Prime customers. Let’s assume there are 5 million Prime customers.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="bold">Existing Prime customers</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">With a $10 price reduction that reduces annual revenues by $50 million.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="bold">New Prime customers</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">We need to estimate how many new Prime customers will be gained from the changes. Finally, let’s consider additional revenue from the membership, along with incremental sales.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Let’s say Prime membership jumps 20 percent due to the price cut. That’s an additional 1 million Prime customers. The incremental membership revenue is roughly $70 million. Average shipping costs per customer is around $40 per year. Let’s say that moving these customers into Prime increases shipping costs by $20 per year per new Prime customer. That’s an additional $20MM cost.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Lastly, we can anticipate more frequent purchases due to free 2-day shipping. Let’s say there’s an additional $40 worth of purchases per new Prime customer per year. Amazon’s gross margins are 25%, so that’s an extra $10 per year per new Prime customer.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">To recap on the net annual impact:</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="bold">Existing Prime customers</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">-$50 million net</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="bold">New Prime customers</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">+$60 million net = +$70 million member revenue -$20 million incremental shipping costs + $10 million incremental gross margin</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: So what’s the overall change in revenue, and what’s your recommendation?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: Overall, we’re looking at a $10 million annual increase from reducing price from $10. I recommend we reduce price.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><hr class="calibre_32"/><p class="calibre_16"><span class="bold">Comments: Candidate covered all the primary dimensions: increases in revenue and costs, as well as impact with respect to new and existing customers. Candidate had to make a lot of assumptions, but that’s typical as many interviewers are tight-lipped on details and assumptions.</span></p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_45"></div>
