Over the last five years, I’ve helped job seekers get their dream jobs. During that period, I’ve taught my clients the fundamentals of product management, design, business, technology, and face-to-face communication.<br class="calibre2"/>
</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Over the years, my clients have asked me for sample answers for case interview questions for the likes of Google, Amazon, Facebook, LinkedIn and Microsoft. To my clients, you’ve inspired me to write that book. I hope you enjoy it.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">This book focuses on sample answers. On the Internet, there is no shortage of tips and frameworks on how to answer these questions. But actual answer responses— that’s rare. That’s what you’ll get here.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">This book also provides context without which you may not understand why a particular question would be asked or if your planned response is good or bad. I have provided some brief advice before each question type on how to approach a particular category of questions.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">The product management case interview is tough. It combines interview questions that would otherwise appear for positions in disparate disciplines, including project management, product design, software engineering, management consulting and marketing.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">The best way to prepare is to practice. This book will help you develop responses with the help of sample answers. You won’t be caught off guard with unexpected interview questions. You will be able to analyze differences between responses and determine what’s best for you. When the big interview day comes, with your new found awareness and knowledge, your responses will be convincing and penetrating.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">The aim of the book is not to give you a script to read from during an interview, but to prepare you for whatever questions may come your way. By working with this book, your response will sound practiced, but not in the regurgitated way that interviewers can easily detect. In fact, the book will prepare you to answer unique employer-specific questions that aren’t in this book.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">This book will prepare you for an interview both by helping you with your content and your delivery. For the sake of simplicity, I refer to hypothetical candidates as “he” and hypothetical interviewers as “she.”</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">There is no substitute for true, in-depth knowledge. That is the product manager’s burden. You have to be an expert in so many different fields. Over time, if you haven’t already, you should develop intellectual curiosity for all the product management disciplines – from design to business to technical. You’ll find that interview responses will come more naturally.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">In addition to the content of your answers, delivery is equally important. Good product management candidates give answers that are impactful, influential, engaging and precise. Many ineffective candidates ramble at the same cadence as dull corporate jargon. It’s important to be crisp in your responses and avoid boring answers.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Good luck with your interviews. By challenging yourself and practicing, you won’t need it!</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_4"></div>
