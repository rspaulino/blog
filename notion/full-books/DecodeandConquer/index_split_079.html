<p id="filepos379230" class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre4">Answer</span></p><p id="filepos379303" class="calibre_21"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold"> Tell me a time when you influenced engineering to build a particular feature.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: In my current role, I’m the monetization product manager for our free email product.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Two weeks ago, Emma, the engineering manager, gave me some bad news, “William, I’m sorry, but we have to remove 160x600 skyscraper ad. My engineering VP told me that the PM team wouldn’t mind.” I was thinking to myself: “Are you kidding me? Wouldn’t mind? This ad was only the 3 <sup class="calibre5"><small class="calibre6"><span class="calibre6">rd</span></small></sup> most valuable ad placement on the entire site. It delivered $75 million in revenue per year. Who did Emma think was paying her salary?”</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">After I collected my emotions, I asked Emma, “When are you planning to remove it?” She said, “Two code sprints from now. About 6 weeks.”</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">I told her, “Can you give me three days to pull some data? I’d like to understand the impact of this decision.”</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">After she left, I thought: what could I do? I could have a hissy fit and complain loudly. Or I could immediately escalate to the engineering VP. While I was tempted to go with either or both solutions, I wouldn’t get what I want unless I was armed with the facts. Before I figured my plan, I gave my boss a heads-up. He wasn’t pleased with engineering’s unilateral response, but he agreed with my plan.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">I logged into the data warehouse and pulled revenue numbers for the last 12 months. Next I asked to sales team to gauge customer reaction if we no longer made the product available. Lastly, I reached out to the VP Engineering’s Chief of Staff to better understand why we wanted to remove the ad.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">After I collected the data, I set up a meeting with Emma, my boss, and the VP of Engineering. The VP of Engineering reiterated his decision to remove the skyscraper ad. He maintained what I had heard earlier: the skyscraper ads were the reason why the email product’s engagement and market share was down.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">I asked him, “Why do you think the ads impact engagement?”</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">He said, “They distract the user.”</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">I replied, “Are there times when you don’t find the ads distracting?”</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">He said, “Yes, when it’s relevant to the content. Let’s say I’m reading an email about meeting with friends, and the ads suggest things new restaurants and bars.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">So I summarized, “So, you don’t have a problem with ads. What you’re really concerned about is the quality of the ads.”</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">I recommended that rather than remove the ads completely, we should revisit our ad policy and make sure that we’re serving relevant ads. We can tighten up our ad editorial processes so that low quality ads aren’t mindlessly approved by the system.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">He was shocked when I told him that the ad placement generated $200 million in annual revenue. And he also didn’t realize that by pulling the placement, customers would pull advertising budget, primarily because it wasn’t worth continuing a relationship with us, given the low ad volume and lack of attractive ad placements, relative to our competitors.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Two months later, we rolled out the new ad policy and approval processes. We minimized many of the low quality teeth whitening, weight loss ads that were known for distracting tactics such as pop-ups, fake navigation, and blinking sections. It required a lot more work on our editorial team and advertisers. Shortly after, we later found that email user engagement did go up by 3%, and most importantly, we preserved $200 million in revenue.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><hr class="calibre_32"/><p class="calibre_16"><span class="bold">Comments: The candidate presented an engaging story on how he influenced the engineering VP to postpone his decision to remove a critical ad placement. He demonstrated thoughtfulness and maturity. He also indicated quantitative ability and willingness to work with different teams. He also showed creativity in coming up with a unique, final solution that was different from what the engineering VP wanted originally. The first person narrative, use of details, and a complete</span>
<span class="bold">beginning-to-end story arc distinguishes this example from other candidate’s who’s delivery may not be as polished.</span></p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_79"></div>
