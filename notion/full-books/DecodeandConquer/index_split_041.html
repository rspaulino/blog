Instead, I want you to provide a back-of-the-envelope estimate.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: And to clarify, are you looking for McDonald’s annual U.S. revenue?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: Annual revenue yes. But I want the international revenue number.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: Okay, here’s how I’ll approach the question. I’ll do a bottom-up approach. I’ll first estimate the revenue of a single McDonald’s store here in the U.S., and then I’ll multiply that number by the number of U.S. stores. Finally, I’ll extrapolate the U.S. revenue number to an international number.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Okay, go for it.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: When I think about a single McDonald’s, I believe most McDonalds’ are open 24 hours or at least from 7a.m., to 11p.m.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">I believe that McDonald’s busy hours are 8a.m., to 8p.m. every day. During these peak times, there are 50 to 80 groups of customers per hour. If we take the midpoint of the range, we get 65 groups. A group of customers could be a single person or even a family of four. Let’s say on average its two people. 65 times 2 equal 130 customers per hour.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Kids usually order happy meals, which retail for $5. Adults usually get a combo, which retails for $8. Let’s say the average revenue per customer is $7. $7 average revenue times 130 is $910 per hour.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">The busy period is about 12 hours in length. Multiple 12 times $910 per hour. We get $10,920 during peak hours. Let’s say that a typical McDonald’s store makes 15 percent of its revenue out of peak hours. Thus, during the whole day a typical McDonald’s makes $12,847.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Extrapolate that over the course of a year and a single McDonald’s makes $4.7 million.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Now to estimate McDonald’s U.S. revenue, we need to factor in the number of stores. I live in Seattle, and there are probably 10 McDonald’s. Seattle is one of the bigger cities in the US. I’d estimate the typical US city only has 3 McDonalds.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">As for the number of cities in the United States, there are 50 states. Each state must have at least 100 cities. So that’s 5,000 cities. 5,000 cities multiplied by 3 McDonalds’ per city; that gives us 15,000 McDonalds.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Multiple 15,000 by annual revenue of $4.7 million, and we get $70.5B per year.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">For many companies, like Google, U.S. revenue is approximately half the total revenue. If we use similar assumptions, the worldwide McDonald’s revenue is $141B.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: In 2008, the average McDonald’s store makes about $3 million per year. Why do you think your estimate is off?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: I likely overestimated the number of customers per hour. In retrospect, McDonald’s is really busiest around lunchtime. I probably should have shaved off twenty to thirty percent the number of customers going into a McDonald’s.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><hr class="calibre_32"/><p class="calibre_16"><span class="bold">Comments: Candidate did a good job with a bottom up approach for the revenue estimate. The candidate asked the right clarifying questions, gave a brief overview of approach, multiplied numbers in a way that was easy to follow and gave a reasonable estimate.</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p id="filepos207770" class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold"> How many queries per second does Gmail get?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: Do I get any additional background information?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: Nope, that’s it. I’m waiting for your number.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: Okay, I’m going to define a query as a Gmail operation. It could be a read, write or search operation.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">First, I’m going to estimate the number of Gmail users. Then, I’ll estimate how often they use the service and how many operations they perform.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: Go on.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: Starting from the top and working our way down: there are approx. 7 billion people in the world. Internet usage in developed countries is likely to be in the 70 to 80 percent range. However, it’s much lower for developing countries. So I’ll assume that 40 percent of 7 billion people, or 2. 8 billion people use the Internet.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">The next number I need is the percentage of people that use Gmail as their primary account. When I think about my friends, I’d say about 70 percent use Gmail as their primary account. I know several that use other services. Given that my friends are more tech-savvy and American-centric than others, let’s say worldwide only 20 percent use Gmail as their primary account. That gives us 560 million Gmail primary users.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">I log into my Gmail account multiple times a day, but let’s say the average Gmail user logs into their account about 4 times a week. Each time they login, let’s say they read on average eight emails, compose two emails and search for one email. Thus, the number of queries is:</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="italic">(4 Gmail logins per week) x ([8 read email operations per login] + [2 compose email operations per login] + [1 search email operation]) = 44 Gmail queries per week per user</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: Finally, to get number of Gmail queries per second, we do the following math: <span class="italic">(560 million Gmail users) * (44 Gmail operations per week per user) * (1 week per 604,800 seconds) = 40.7k queries per second</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: There are approximately 41k Gmail queries per second.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><hr class="calibre_32"/><p class="calibre_16"><span class="bold">Comments: Candidate does well, especially since the interviewer hasn’t been too helpful. Methodology is reasonable, and the calculations are easy to follow.</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p id="filepos210639" class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold"> How many iPhones are sold in the US each year?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: For this question, I’d like to start with stating assumptions and then doing my top down calculations.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Starting with the assumptions:</p><div class="calibre_10"> </div><ul class="calibre_20"><li value="1" class="calibre_19">There are approximately 315 million people in the United States.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_19">90 percent of people have a cell phone.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_19">Cell phone users are locked into contracts. That is, they cannot get a new phone unless they pay a penalty to break a contract.

However, his delivery is a bit abrupt. He rattles off assumptions without giving us the big picture. Then the numbers are just crunched at the end. It would have been easier to follow if the candidate multiplied the numbers as he was uncovering his assumptions.</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p id="filepos213260" class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold"> Estimate how much it costs to run Flickr for a 20GB user.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: Just a quick clarification, when you say 20GB user, are you saying that the user is using 20GB of storage, or they bought a plan, which allows them up to 20GB storage?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: The latter.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: I assume you want me to calculate costs of actual usage. That is, if they signed up for a 20GB plan, and they use something less than 20GB. That’s the number you want?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: Yes.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: And you want me to estimate costs per year or per month?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: Per month.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: Okay. Let’s say that each Flickr user uploads 10 pictures per week.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Each picture is roughly 5 MB in size.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Multiply 10 by 5 MB each. That’s 50 MB each week. That’s about 2.5 GB of storage for the year. But what we really need is the average cost at any given point in the year. So let’s just take the mid-point, and the average user, in its first year has about 1.25 GB.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Let’s talk about storage costs. I’ll estimate storage costs to be 10 cents per GB per month. That’s roughly how much Amazon S3 charges for storage. We’re storing 1.25GB per user, so multiply that with $. 10 per GB/mo. gives us 12.5 cents per month. Per year, that’s $1.50 per user.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">From a bandwidth perspective, we usually show the optimized version of the photo. Let’s assume optimization can reduce file sizes by 40 percent. So rather than see the full 5 MB, let’s say the user sees a 2MB version.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Assume each picture gets viewed on average 10 times per month. So that’s 10 x 2 MB each, so 20 MB gets transferred.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">We assumed that the user uploads 10 pictures per week. That’s 520 photos per year. Let’s take the midpoint again, and we get 260 photos. So that’s 5.2GB per month.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Let’s say the bandwidth costs are 12 cents per GB per month. If we round our 5.2GB to 5GB, we get 60 cents per month per user.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><hr class="calibre_32"/><p class="calibre_16"><span class="bold">Comments: The flow, calculations and clarification questions are good. There are several numbers that are being crunched, and the interviewer could get lost. The candidate could improve comprehension by drawing his approach on the whiteboard and doing the calculations on the whiteboard instead of rattling off numbers and using his notepad for a math scratch pad.</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p id="filepos216404" class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold"> How many elevators do you need for a 50-story building?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: You just care about my thought process for this question, right?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: Your thought process is important, but I also want you to come up with an actual number.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: Okay. Give me a moment to collect my thoughts.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="italic">Candidate pauses for 30 seconds</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: I’m going to evaluate the number of elevators we need based on how many passengers we need to transport.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">To start, I’ll estimate how many people use the elevators and how long they’re willing to wait. In the elevator industry, it’s assumed that people are willing to wait 20 seconds for an elevator. It’s also important to know how many people enter the building during peak times. I forgot to ask: is this building for office, retail, or residential use?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">INTERVIEWER: This is an office building.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: If the first part was all about elevator demand, this second part is about elevator capacity. I’d like to estimate:</p><div class="calibre_10"> </div><ul class="calibre_20"><li value="1" class="calibre_19">How many people can fit an elevator?</li><li value="2" class="calibre_19">What’s the elevator’s average speed?</li><li value="3" class="calibre_19">How long does an elevator stay open before closing and resuming travel?</li></ul><p class="calibre_8">It may also be important to know whether there are alternative transportation methods such as stairs or escalators. For the sake of simplicity, we’ll set that aside.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Let’s assume this is a 50 story office building and that each floor contains 120 employees. In total, that’s 6,000 people in a 50 story office building.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">People get to work between 8a.m. and 9a.m. The 6,000 people arrive uniformly during this 60 min. duration. That’s 100 people per minute.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">We want people to wait no more than 20 seconds per elevator. 33 people, on average, wait 20 seconds.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">To determine how many elevators are needed to transport 33 people once every 20 seconds, we need to determine the effective throughput of an elevator.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Let’s assume there are 12 feet per floor and the elevator travels 20 feet per second. Let’s also assume that in a 50 story building, the elevator stops 12 times on its way up, and each stop takes about 20 seconds.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Let’s calculate the numbers. There are 600 feet in this building. At 20 feet per second, it takes 30 seconds to get to the top. However, there are 12 stops on the way up, so that takes 240 seconds. On average, it takes 270 seconds to go up. Let’s say it takes half the time to make it’s way down in the morning or 135 seconds. In total that’s 6.75 minutes to go up and down.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Let’s say each elevator can contain 10 people. It would take 3.3 elevators to transport the first batch of waiting passengers. Since 6.75 minutes will have elapsed before those first set of 3.3 elevators make its way back, you’ll need an additional 67 elevators to service them all.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Just to gut check my solution, Seattle’s Columbia Tower has 83 floors, and they have 46 elevators.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><hr class="calibre_32"/><p class="calibre_16"><span class="bold">Comments: Candidate asked some good clarifying questions and demonstrated customer empathy. Nice approach of evaluating demand first, then capacity. A potential follow-up question is discussing elevator algorithms to service incoming requests, which is covered later in the book.</span></p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_41"></div>
