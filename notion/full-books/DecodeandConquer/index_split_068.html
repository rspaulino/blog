How did you react?</li></ul><p class="calibre_8">However, some interviewers are concerned that a candidate’s responses could be canned. Instead, they prefer a stress simulation at the interview. That is, ask an interview question that puts the candidate in an uncomfortable situation and see how they respond. This may involve using questions that have no right answer, with the interviewer playing the obnoxious devil’s advocate to see whether you waffle or become defensive.
