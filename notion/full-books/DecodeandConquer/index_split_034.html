If necessary, ask to clarify the goal and the problem statement.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_19"><span class="bold">Work through the simple base case</span>. The solution and the accompanying clarifying questions will be more apparent as you work through it.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_19"><span class="bold">Talk aloud</span>. It’ll help the interviewer understand where you’re headed. The interviewer may even intervene and provide helpful guidance.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_19"><span class="bold">Write the technical solution, if necessary</span>. For most organizations, they don’t expect the syntax to be perfect; pseudo code is fine.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_19"><span class="bold">Review the code</span>. Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses. Revise as necessary. Few can write code without bugs in the first pass.</li></ol><p class="calibre_8">We’ve shared some simple technical questions here. However, I also recommend reviewing core computer science concepts, such as sorting algorithms, trees and hash tables. Then practice the same coding questions companies would ask entry-level software engineers. Companies like Google understand that you may be rusty, but they do want you to attempt the technical interview question.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_34"></div>
