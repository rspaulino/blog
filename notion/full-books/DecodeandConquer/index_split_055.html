Pick either the pro or con side of the argument and explain your position for or against including ads on the site.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: Give me a moment to think about this.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="italic">Candidate takes 60 seconds.</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: Launching Amazon display advertisements is a good decision and there are two reasons why:</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="bold">It helps customer experience.</span> Advertisements can minimize negative customer experiences and possibly enhance a positive customer experience. Let’s say a customer was intent on buying a product, but Amazon is out of stock. The customer was going to leave the site anyway. Amazon can direct the consumer to a competitor that does have the product, enhancing the customer experience. Alternatively, advertising can highlight special offers, enhancing the Amazon shopping experience.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="bold">It provides additional revenue</span>. Advertisers will pay Amazon to achieve the advertiser’s business goals. For instance, manufacturers might want to increase awareness, increase up sell, or shift share away from competitor’s products.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">There’s even an opportunity to sell ads to Amazon’s competitors. Amazon’s competitors may be too happy to meet an Amazon customer’s unmet purchase needs.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">The latter case may feel bizarre, but there is a revenue opportunity, along with an opportunity for improved customer satisfaction. This revenue can be used to further invest in the Amazon customer experience.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><hr class="calibre_32"/><p class="calibre_16"><span class="bold">Comments: The interviewer is testing the candidate’s ability to make a proposal and back it with evidence. The key is to be precise and specific, avoiding the corporate jargon and nonsense words that cloud most corporate communications. Stay factual, or at least logical, because subjective statements, invite skepticism particularly if they’re not backed with evidence. Having numbers and hard data always helps. Also, be decisive and have hard conviction behind a single position. The interviewer will note candidates who refuse to commit one way or the other.</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p id="filepos264194" class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold"> Now tell me why display advertising is a bad decision.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_17">CANDIDATE: Launching display advertisements on Amazon are a bad decision, and here’s why:</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="bold">Distracts customers from purchasing products</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Ads can clutter the customer experience. For example, it may be harder for the customer to find what they want. In the short-term, it could lead to increased bounce rates, more abandoned shopping carts and reduced conversions. In the long-term, it could lead to fewer repeat visits as customers search for shopping alternatives that are less cluttered and frustrating.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="bold">Create a negative brand perception</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Over time, customers could notice that Amazon repeatedly refers customers to other retailers. Rather than come to Amazon as their first shopping destination, they may choose to go to those retailers first. This will give the competitor an opportunity to establish their reputation as the first place to find &amp; research products they need.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><hr class="calibre_32"/><p class="calibre_16"><span class="bold">Comments: This is a common follow-up question to the previous question. The interviewer is seeing how quickly a candidate can abandon your previous position, take a new position and identify the right arguments for the opposing view. It’s testing whether a candidate can see both sides of the issue, adapt to change and leave behind a preconceived notion of what should have been done.</span></p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_55"></div>
