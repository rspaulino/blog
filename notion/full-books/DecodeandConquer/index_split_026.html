It’ll sound scripted. Not too long ago, a product management candidate started the design interview with, “First, I want to understand the product. Second, I want to talk about potential customers. Third, I want talk about their needs. Fourth, I will prioritize their needs. Fifth, I will brainstorm solutions. Sixth, I will evaluate trade-offs. Seventh, I will make my recommendation.”</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Interviewers will react to candidates that sound robotic. Some will label the person as over prepared. Others, like me, would fear that the candidate is inexperienced. Inexperienced candidates lack confidence. They are more likely to strictly follow a prescribed framework.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Contrast the previous response with the following: “I’m not too familiar with the product. Can you tell me more about it? That’s fascinating. I can see why they would find feature X valuable. However, it doesn’t quite sound like the product meets their needs. Do you mind if I explore that in more detail?”</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">This sounds like a conversation I could have with a co-worker. The candidate also seems polished and confident. The interview is about establishing credibility and likability. Interviewers don’t like robots. They like candidates that have personality and are similar to the interviewer.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">One last thing, the interviewer is looking for problem solvers who can think critically. Frameworks are meant to be a memory aid. Adapt to your specific interview question.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Interviewers can tell when you used a hammer when a scalpel would have sufficed. Use and trust your own judgment and you’ll be amazed how natural your responses will be. You’ll also have more fun when you’re not straining to parrot a technique you learned from a book.<br class="calibre2"/>
