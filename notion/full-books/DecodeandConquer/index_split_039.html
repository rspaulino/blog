That is, collect a single data point and then assume that what’s true for a single data point can be assumed for the data point in question. For instance, if we are trying to estimate iPhone sales in the United States, we might start by visiting a single Apple store in New York City. With a clipboard in hand, we might ask outgoing customers whether they bought an iPhone. After an hour’s worth of data, we can make inferences on how many iPhones are sold in the store in a given day, month or year. And from there, we can infer sales across all Apples stores in the United States.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_39"></div>
