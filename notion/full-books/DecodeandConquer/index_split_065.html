The vision must solve a real problem. Pursuits that are cool aren’t worthwhile. This problem also needs to be big. It has to solve a problem for billions of people or dollars.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_19"><span class="bold">Be unique and memorable</span>. Most candidates answer vision questions with the first idea in their heads. More often than not, their answer is “tighter integration between two products.” Not only is it not compelling, but it’s not unique or memorable. Good visions move us. We obsess over them. We can’t wait to share those bold visions with our friends and colleagues.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_19"><span class="bold">Describe how it will be solved</span>. There are two parts to a good vision response, and it includes both the vision and how it will be accomplished. Each part should have equal air time. A response with the first part, but without the second will not stick. The vision will be derided as a pipe dream. The burden is on you. Convince us that it’s doable and go into specifics.</li></ol><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_65"></div>
