That is, do you espouse and demonstrate the employer’s corporate values? Some corporations look for candidates who aren’t afraid of speaking up, even when it means contradicting a respected executive. Other employers want candidates who can adopt mindsets that aren’t their own but might originate from someone else in the company.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">To summarize, prepare by understanding the corporate values. It’ll give you clues on what they expect in a good response.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="bold">Manage the stress.</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">The interview is stressful enough as it is. Having a skeptical and possibly obnoxious interviewer makes it more difficult.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">To manage the stress, use a technique called exposure therapy. That is, find a friend before the interview. Have that friend be the tough interviewer. After a couple of exposures, your heart will be less likely to race when someone gives you a tough time. You’ll realize what everyone else realizes during the stress interview: you’ll survive.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="bold">Separate the question from the emotion.</span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">After the initial emotional flood triggers you, approach the question in an objective, intellectually curious way. If you think the question is meant to torture, let those thoughts go.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">All of these questions are valid. For example, it’s someone’s job to determine whether or not to be a whistleblower on a cheating executive. Or, despite the blunt delivery, it’s also fair for the interviewer to tell you that they’ve heard better answers to the same question.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Release the emotion. Focus back on what the interviewer is saying, openly approach the question, think through your response and construct a thoughtful, objective answer.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_69"></div>
