<p id="filepos68393" class="calibre_17"><span class="calibre4"> Tip: Interview Visually</span></p><p class="calibre_21">A product manager’s job is to effectively communicate their ideas and pictures often express ideas better than words.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">During the product management interview, take this to heart. When critiquing a website or product, have visuals accessible and ready for display. When introducing an idea, be prepared to walk up to the whiteboard and sketch out wireframes. Standing up with a pen in hand, and leading an audience, even an audience of one, through a design critique or proposal feels authoritative. Hiring managers want product management candidates that radiate leadership.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">If you want to really impress the interviewer, redesign a web page at home, using your favorite mockup tool whether it’s Balsamiq, Adobe Photoshop, or Microsoft PowerPoint. Bring copies of your visuals to the interview, and subtly introduce your redesign at the beginning of the interview. You can say, “When I was preparing for the interview, I couldn’t help but redesign your profile page. (Share your visuals.)We can talk about my redesign during the interview, if you’d like.”</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">This tactic will absolutely melt hearts. It stands out. Few candidates take the initiative and effort to do this. Others don’t do this because they’re afraid. They either find this tactic unconventional or they’re afraid to commit their design ideas to paper.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">Let’s think about it. There’s a strong likelihood they’ll ask you a design question at the interview. Would you rather come up with a half-baked solution at the interview? Or would you rather spend a Sunday thinking through several variations and polishing up something presentable on Adobe Photoshop?</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_17">To move onto the next round or to get a job offer, it’s simply about two things: credibility and likeability. Visually sharing your ideas portrays confidence in your design skills.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_18"></div>
