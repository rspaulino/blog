he previous chapter discussed variability in the measurement or judgment of a single case. When we focus on a single case, all variability of judgment is error, and the two constituents of error are bias and noise. Of course, the judgment systems we are examining, including those involving courts and insurance companies, are designed to deal with different cases and to discriminate among them. Federal judges and claims adjusters would be of little use if they returned the same judgment for all the cases that come their way. Much of the variability in judgments of different cases is intentional.</div>
<div class="s4P">However, variability in judgments of the same case is still undesirable—it is system noise. As we will show, a noise audit in which the same people make judgments about several cases permits a more detailed analysis of system noise.</div>
<div class="s7D">A Noise Audit of Sentencing</div>
<div class="s4M">To illustrate the analysis of noise with multiple cases, we turn to an exceptionally detailed noise audit of sentencing by federal judges. The analysis was published in 1981 as part of the movement toward sentencing reform that we described in <a href="part0008.xhtml">chapter 1</a>
. The study narrowly focused on sentencing decisions, but the lessons it offers are general and bear on other professional judgments. The goal of the noise audit was to go beyond the vivid but anecdotal evidence of noise assembled by Judge Frankel and others and to “determine the extent of sentencing disparity” more systematically.</div>
<div class="s4P">The study’s authors developed sixteen hypothetical cases in <span id="page_69"></span>
which the defendant had been found guilty and was to be sentenced. The vignettes depicted either robberies or cases of fraud and differed on six other dimensions, including whether the defendant was a principal or an accomplice in the crime, whether he had a criminal record, whether (for the robbery cases) a weapon had been used, and so on.</div>
<div class="s4P">The researchers organized carefully structured interviews with a national sample of 208 active federal judges. In the course of ninety minutes, the judges were presented with all sixteen cases and asked to set a sentence.</div>
<div class="s4P">To appreciate what can be learned from this study, you will find an exercise in visualization helpful. Picture a large table with sixteen columns for the crimes, labeled from A to P, and 208 rows for the judges, labeled 1 to 208. Each cell, from A1 to P208, shows the prison term set for a particular case by a particular judge. <a href="part0014.xhtml#a2YH">Figure 9</a>
 illustrates what this 3,328-cell table would look like. To study noise, we will want to focus on the sixteen columns, each of which is a separate noise audit.</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="s7D">Mean Sentences</div>
<div class="s4M">There is no objective way to determine what the “true value” of a sentence is for a particular case. In what follows, we treat the average of the 208 sentences for each case (mean sentence) as if it were the “just” sentence for that case. As we noted in <a href="part0008.xhtml">chapter 1</a>
, the US Sentencing Commission made the same assumption when it used the average practice in past cases as the foundation for establishing sentencing guidelines. This label assumes zero bias in the mean judgment of each case.</div>
<div id="page_70" class="s4P">We are fully aware that, in reality, this assumption is wrong: the average judgment of some cases is quite likely to be biased relative to the average judgment of other, highly similar cases, for example because of racial discrimination. The variance of biases across cases—some positive, some negative—is an important source of error and unfairness. Confusingly, this variance is what is often referred to as “bias.” Our analysis in this chapter—and in this book—is focused on noise, which is a distinct source of error. Judge Frankel emphasized the injustice of noise, but also drew attention to bias (including racial discrimination). Similarly, our focus on noise should not be taken to diminish the importance of measuring and combating shared biases.</div>
<div class="s4P">For convenience, the mean sentence for each case is indicated in the bottom row of the table. The cases are arranged in increasing order of severity: the mean sentence in Case A is 1 year; in Case P it is 15.3 years. The average prison term for all sixteen cases is 7 years.</div>
<div class="s4P">Now imagine a perfect world in which all judges are flawless measuring instruments of justice, and sentencing is noise-free. What would <a href="part0014.xhtml#a2YH">figure 9</a>
 look like in such a world? Evidently, all the cells in the Case A column would be identical, because all judges would give the defendant in case A the same sentence of exactly one year. The same would be true in all the other columns. The numbers in each row, of course, would still vary, because the cases are different. But each row would be identical to the one above it and below it. The differences between the cases would be the only source of variability in the table.</div>
<div class="s4P">Unfortunately, the world of federal justice is not perfect. The judges are not identical, and variability within columns is large, indicating noise in the judgments of each case. There is more variability in sentences than there should be, and the study’s aim is to analyze it.</div>
<div class="s7D">The Sentencing Lottery</div>
<div class="s4M">Start from the picture of the perfect world we described above, in which all cases receive the same punishment from every judge. Each column is a series of 208 identical numbers. Now, add noise by going <span id="page_71"></span>
down each column and changing some numbers here and there—sometimes by adding prison time to the mean sentence, sometimes by subtracting from it. Because the changes you make are not all the same, they create variability within the column. This variability is noise.</div>
<div class="s4P">The essential result of this study is the large amount of noise observed <span class="s2WT-0">within the judgments of each case</span>
. The measure of noise within each case is the standard deviation of the prison terms assigned to that case. For the average case, the mean sentence was 7.0 years, and the standard deviation around that mean was 3.4 years.</div>
<div class="s4P">While you may well be familiar with the term <span class="s2WT-0">standard deviation</span>
, you may find a concrete description useful. Imagine that you randomly pick two judges and compute the difference between their judgments of a case. Now repeat, for all pairs of judges and all cases, and average the results. This measure, the <span class="s2WT-0">mean absolute difference,</span>
 should give you a sense of the lottery that faces the defendant in a federal courtroom. Assuming that the judgments are normally distributed, it is 1.128 times the standard deviation, which implies that the average difference between two randomly chosen sentences of the same case will be 3.8 years. In <a href="part0010.xhtml">chapter 3</a>
, we spoke of the lottery that faces the client who needs specialized underwriting from an insurance company. The criminal defendant’s lottery is, to say the least, more consequential.</div>
<div class="s4P">A mean absolute difference of 3.8 years between judges when the average sentence is 7.0 years is a disturbing and, in our view, unacceptable result. Yet there are good reasons to suspect that there is even more noise in the actual administration of justice. First, the participants in the noise audit dealt with artificial cases, which were unusually easy to compare and were presented in immediate succession. Real life does not provide nearly as much support for the maintenance of consistency. Second, judges in a courtroom have much more information than they had here. New information, unless it is decisive, provides more opportunities for judges to differ from one another. For these reasons, we suspect that the amount of noise defendants face in actual courtrooms is even larger than what we see here.</div>
<div id="page_72" class="s7D">Some Judges Are Severe: Level Noise</div>
<div class="s4M">In the next step of the analysis, the authors broke down noise into separate components. The first interpretation of noise that probably came to your mind—as it did to Judge Frankel’s mind—is that noise is due to variation among judges in their disposition to set severe sentences. As any defense lawyer will tell you, judges have reputations, some for being harsh “hanging judges,” who are more severe than the average judge, and others for being “bleeding-heart judges,” who are more lenient than the average judge. We refer to these deviations as <span class="s2WT-0">level errors</span>
. (Again: error is defined here as a deviation from the average; an error may in fact correct an injustice, if the average judge is wrong.)</div>
<div class="s4P">Variability in level errors will be found in any judgment task. Examples are evaluations of performance where some supervisors are more generous than others, predictions of market share where some forecasters are more optimistic than others, or recommendations for back surgery where some orthopedists are more aggressive than others.</div>
<div class="s4P">Each row in <a href="part0014.xhtml#a2YH">figure 9</a>
 shows the sentences set by one judge. The mean sentence set by each judge, shown in the rightmost column of the table, is a measure of the judge’s level of severity. As it turns out, judges vary widely on this dimension. The standard deviation of the values in the rightmost column was 2.4 years. This variability has nothing to do with justice. Instead, as you might suspect, differences in average sentencing reflect variation among judges in other characteristics—their backgrounds, life experiences, political opinions, biases, and so on. The researchers examined the judges’ attitudes to sentencing in general—for example, whether they think the main goal of sentencing is incapacitation (removing the criminal from society), rehabilitation, or deterrence. They found that judges who think that the main goal is rehabilitation tend to assign shorter prison sentences and more supervised time than do judges who pointed to deterrence or incapacitation. Separately, judges located in the American South assigned significantly longer sentences than did their counterparts in other parts of the country. Not surprisingly, conservative ideology was also related to severity of sentences.</div>
<div class="s4P">The general conclusion is that the average level of sentencing <span id="page_73"></span>
functions like a personality trait. You could use this study to arrange judges on a scale that ranges from very harsh to very lenient, just as a personality test might measure their degree of extraversion or agreeableness. Like other traits, we would expect severity of sentencing to be correlated with genetic factors, with life experiences, and with other aspects of personality. None of these has anything to do with the case or the defendant. We use the term <span class="s2WT-0">level noise</span>
 for the variability of the judges’ average judgments, which is identical to the variability of level errors.</div>
<div class="s7D">Judges Differ: Pattern Noise</div>
<div class="s4M">As the black arrows show in <a href="part0014.xhtml#a2YH">figure 9</a>
, level noise is 2.4 years and system noise is 3.4 years. This difference indicates that there is more to system noise than differences in average severity across individual judges. We will call this other component of noise <span class="s2WT-0">pattern noise</span>
.</div>
<div class="s4P">To understand pattern noise, consider again <a href="part0014.xhtml#a2YH">figure 9</a>
, and focus on one randomly chosen cell—say, cell C3. The mean sentence in Case C is shown at the bottom of the column; as you can see, it is 3.7 years. Now, look at the rightmost column to find the mean sentence given by Judge 3 across all cases. It is 5.0 years, just 2.0 years less than the grand mean. If the variation in judges’ severity were the only source of noise in column 3, you would predict that the sentence in cell C3 is 3.7 − 2.0 = 1.7 years. But the actual entry in cell C3 is 4 years, indicating that Judge 3 was especially harsh in sentencing that case.</div>
<div class="s4P">The same simple, additive logic would let you predict every sentence in every column of the table, but in fact you would find deviations from the simple model in most cells. Looking across a row, you will find that judges are not equally severe in their sentencing of all cases: they are harsher than their personal average in some and more lenient in others. We call these residual deviations <span class="s2WT-0">pattern errors.</span>
 If you wrote down these pattern errors in each cell of the table, you would find that they add up to zero for every judge (row) and that they also add up to zero for every case (column). However, the pattern errors do not cancel out in their contribution to noise, because the values in all cells are squared for the <span id="page_74"></span>
computation of noise.</div>
<div class="s4P">There is an easier way to confirm that the simple additive model of sentencing does not hold. You can see in the table that the mean sentences at the bottom of each column increase steadily from left to right, but the same is not true within the rows. Judge 208, for example, set a much higher sentence to the defendant in Case O than to the defendant in Case P. If individual judges ranked the cases by the prison time they thought appropriate, their rankings would not be the same.</div>
<div class="s4P">We use the term <span class="s2WT-0">pattern noise</span>
 for the variability we just identified, because that variability reflects a complex pattern in the attitudes of judges to particular cases. One judge, for instance, may be harsher than average in general but relatively more lenient toward white-collar criminals. Another may be inclined to punish lightly but more severely when the offender is a recidivist. A third may be close to the average severity but sympathetic when the offender is merely an accomplice and tough when the victim is an older person. (We use the term <span class="s2WT-0">pattern noise</span>
 in the interest of readability. The proper statistical term for pattern noise is <span class="s2WT-0">judge × case interaction</span>
—pronounced “judge-by-case.” We apologize to people with statistical training for imposing the burden of translation on them.)</div>
<div class="s4P">In the context of criminal justice, some of the idiosyncratic reactions to cases may reflect the judge’s personal philosophy of sentencing. Other responses may result from associations of which the judge is barely aware, such as a defendant who reminds him of a particularly hateful criminal or who perhaps looks like his daughter. Whatever their origin, these patterns are not mere chance: we would expect them to recur if the judge saw the same case again. But because pattern noise is, in practice, difficult to predict, it adds uncertainty to the already-unpredictable lottery of sentencing. As the study’s authors noted, “Patterned differences between judges in the influence of offense/offender characteristics” are “an additional form of sentence disparity.”</div>
<div class="s4P">You may have noticed that the decomposition of system noise into level noise and pattern noise follows the same logic as the error equation in the previous chapter, which decomposed error into bias and noise. This time, the equation can be written as follows:</div>
<div class="sFJ">
<span class="s2WV-0">System Noise</span>
<span class="s2YT-0">2</span>
 <span class="s2WV-0">= Level Noise</span>
<span class="s2YT-0">2</span>
 <span class="s2WV-0">+ Pattern Noise</span>
<span id="page_75"></span>
<span class="s2YT-0">2</span>
</div>
<div class="s4P">This expression can be represented visually in the same manner as the original Error Equation (<a href="part0014.xhtml#a2YE">Figure 10</a>
). We have represented the two sides of the triangle as equal. That is because, in the study of sentencing, pattern noise and level noise contribute approximately equally to system noise.</div>
<div class="s4P">Pattern noise is pervasive. Suppose that doctors are deciding whether to admit people for hospitalization, that companies are deciding whom to hire, that lawyers are deciding which cases to bring, or that Hollywood executives are deciding which television shows to produce. In all these cases, there will be pattern noise, with different judges producing different rankings of the cases.</div>

<div class="s7D">The Components of Noise</div>
<div class="s4M">Our treatment of pattern noise glossed over a significant complexity: the possible contribution of random error.</div>
<div class="s4P">Recall the stopwatch exercise. When you tried to measure ten seconds repeatedly, your results varied from one lap to the next; you showed within-person variability. By the same token, the judges would not have set precisely the same sentences to the sixteen cases if they had been asked to judge them again on another occasion. Indeed, as we will see, they would not have set the same sentences if <span id="page_76"></span>
the original study had been conducted on another day of the same week. If a judge is in a good mood because something nice happened to her daughter, or because a favorite sports team won yesterday, or because it is a beautiful day, her judgment might be more lenient than it would otherwise be. This within-person variability is conceptually distinct from the stable between-person differences that we have just discussed—but it is difficult to tell these sources of variability apart. Our name for the variability that is due to transient effects is <span class="s2WT-0">occasion noise</span>
.</div>
<div class="s4P">We effectively ignored occasion noise in this study and chose to interpret the judges’ idiosyncratic patterns of sentencing in the noise audit as indicating stable attitudes. This assumption is certainly optimistic, but there are independent reasons to believe that occasion noise did not play a large role in this study. The highly experienced judges who participated in it surely brought with them some set ideas about the significance of various features of offenses and of defendants. In the next chapter, we discuss occasion noise in greater detail and show how it can be separated from the stable component of pattern noise.</div>
<div class="s4P">To summarize, we discussed several types of noise. <span class="s2WT-0">System noise</span>
 is undesirable variability in the judgments of the same case by multiple individuals. We have identified its two major components, which can be separated when the same individuals evaluate multiple cases:</div>
<div class="sJT"><img src="rsrc31K.jpg" alt="" class="sJS" />
 <span class="s2WT-3">Level noise</span>
 <span class="class-2">is variability in the average level of judgments by different judges.</span>
</div>
<div class="sJW"><img src="rsrc31K.jpg" alt="" class="sJS" />
 <span class="s2WT-3">Pattern noise</span>
 <span class="class-2">is variability in judges’ responses to particular cases.</span>
</div>
<div class="s4P">In the present study, the amounts of level noise and pattern noise were approximately equal. However, the component that we identified as pattern noise certainly contains some <span class="s2WT-0">occasion noise</span>
, which can be treated as random error.</div>
<div class="s4P">We have used a noise audit in the judicial system as an illustration, but the same analysis can be applied to any noise audit—in business, medicine, government, or elsewhere. Level noise and pattern noise (which includes occasion noise) both contribute to <span id="page_77"></span>
system noise, and we will encounter them repeatedly as we proceed.</div>

<div class="s86">
