<div class="s11B">Joan Glover v. General Assistance</div>
<div class="s11D">
<span class="class-4">Joan Glover, a six-year-old child, ingested a large number of pills of Allerfree, a nonprescription allergy medicine, and required an extensive hospital stay. Because the overdose weakened her respiratory system, she will be more susceptible to breathing-related diseases such as asthma and emphysema for the rest of her life. The Allerfree bottle used an inadequately designed childproof safety cap.</span>
</div>
<div class="s154">
<span class="class-4">The manufacturer of Allerfree is General Assistance, a large company (with annual profits of $100 million to $200 million) that produces a variety of nonprescription medicines. A federal regulation requires childproof safety caps on all medicine bottles. General Assistance has systematically ignored the intent of this regulation by using a childproof safety cap that had a much higher failure rate than that of others in the industry. An internal company document says that “this stupid, unnecessary federal regulation is a waste of our money” and states that the risk of</span>
 <span id="page_176" class="class-4"></span>
<span class="class-4">being punished is low. The document adds that, in any case, “the punishments for violating the regulation are extremely mild; basically we’d be asked to improve the safety caps in the future.” Although it was warned about its safety cap by an official of the US Food and Drug Administration, the company decided to take no corrective action.</span>

<div class="s17F">$<img src="rsrc31P.jpg" alt="" class="s17M" />
</div>
<div class="sS0">The story of Joan Glover is a slightly abbreviated version of a case used in a study that two of us (Kahneman and Sunstein, along with our friend and collaborator David Schkade) reported in 1998. We describe this study in some detail in this chapter, and we wanted you to experience one of the tasks the study includes, because we now see it as an instructive example of a noise audit, which reprises many of the themes of this book.</div>
<div class="s4P">This chapter focuses on the role of the <span class="s2WT-0">response scale</span>
 as a pervasive source of noise. People may differ in their judgments, not because they disagree on the substance but because they use the scale in different ways. If you were rating the performance of an employee, you might say that on a scale of 0 to 6, the performance was a 4—which, in your view, is pretty good. Someone else might say that on the same scale, the employee’s performance was a 3—which, in his view, is also pretty good. Ambiguity in the wording of scales is a general problem. Much research has been conducted on the difficulties of communication that arise from vague expressions such as “beyond a reasonable doubt,” “clear and convincing evidence,” “outstanding performance,” and “unlikely to happen.” Judgments that are expressed in such phrases are inevitably noisy because they are interpreted differently by both speakers and listeners.</div>
<div class="s4P">In the study for which the Joan Glover case was written, we observed the effects of an ambiguous scale in a situation in which it has serious consequences. The topic of the study was noise in jury-awarded punitive damages. As you could infer from the third question about Joan Glover’s case, the law in the United States (and in some other countries) allows juries in civil cases to impose punitive damages on a defendant whose actions were particularly egregious. Punitive damages are supplemental to compensatory awards, which are designed to make injured people whole. When, as in the Glover example, a product has caused injuries and plaintiffs <span id="page_178"></span>
have successfully sued the company, they will be awarded money to pay their medical bills and any lost wages. But they could also receive a punitive award, intended to send the defendant and similar companies a warning. The behavior of General Assistance in this case was obviously reprehensible; it falls in the range of actions for which a jury could reasonably impose punitive damages.</div>
<div class="s4P">A major concern about the institution of punitive damages has been their unpredictability. The same wrongdoing may be punished by damages that range from very modest to massive. Using the terminology of this book, we would say the system is noisy. Requests for punitive damages are often denied, and even when they are granted, the awards frequently do not add much to compensatory damage. There are striking exceptions, however, and the very large amounts that juries sometimes award appear surprising and arbitrary. An often-mentioned example is a punitive award of $4 million imposed on a car dealership for nondisclosure of the fact that the plaintiff’s new BMW had been repainted.</div>
<div class="s4P">In our study of punitive damages, 899 participants were asked to evaluate Joan Glover’s case and nine other similar cases—all of them involving plaintiffs who had suffered some harm and sued the company that was allegedly responsible. Unlike you, the participants answered only one of the three questions (outrage, punitive intent, or dollar amount) for all ten cases. The participants were further divided into smaller groups, each assigned to one version of each case. The different versions varied the harm suffered by the plaintiff and the revenue of the defendant company. There were a total of twenty-eight scenarios. Our goals were to test a theory about the psychology of punitive damages and to investigate the role of the monetary scale (here dollars) as a main source of noise in this legal institution.</div>
<div class="s7D">The Outrage Hypothesis</div>
<div class="s4M">How to determine a just punishment has been debated by philosophers and legal scholars for centuries. Our hypothesis, however, was that the question that philosophers find difficult is quite easy for ordinary people, who simplify the task by substituting an easy question for the hard one. The easy question, which is <span id="page_179"></span>
answered immediately when you are asked how much General Assistance should be punished is, “How angry am I?” The intensity of the intended punishment will then be matched to the intensity of the outrage.</div>
<div class="s4P">To test this outrage hypothesis, we asked different groups of participants to answer either the punitive intent question or the outrage question. We then compared the average ratings obtained on the two questions for the twenty-eight scenarios used in the study. As expected from the substitution idea, the correlation between the mean ratings of outrage and of punitive intent was a close-to-perfect 0.98 (PC = 94%). This correlation supports the outrage hypothesis: the emotion of outrage is the primary determinant of punitive intent.</div>
<div class="s4P">Outrage is the main driver of punitive intent but not the only one. Did you notice anything in Joan’s story that attracted more attention when you rated punitive intent than when you rated outrage? If you did, we suspect it was the harm she suffered. You can tell whether a behavior is outrageous without knowing its consequences; in this instance, the behavior of General Assistance was surely outrageous. In contrast, intuitions about punitive intent have a retributive aspect, which is crudely expressed in the eye-for-an-eye principle. The urge for retribution explains why attempted murder and murder are treated differently by the law and by juries; a would-be murderer who is lucky enough to miss his target will be punished less severely.</div>
<div class="s4P">To find out whether harm does indeed make a difference in punitive intent but not in outrage, we showed different groups of respondents “severe-harm” and “mild-harm” versions of the Joan Glover case and of several others. The severe-harm version is the one you saw. In the mild-harm version, Joan “had to spend several days in a hospital and is now deeply traumatized by pills of any kind. When her parents try to get her to take even beneficial medications such as vitamins, aspirin, or cold remedies, she cries uncontrollably and says that she is afraid.” This version describes a traumatic experience for the child, but a much lower level of harm than the long-term medical damage described in the first version you read. As expected, the average ratings of outrage were almost identical for the severe-harm version (4.24) and the mild-harm version (4.19). Only the defendant’s behavior matters to outrage; its consequences <span id="page_180"></span>
do not. In contrast, the ratings of punitive intent averaged 4.93 for severe harm and 4.65 for mild harm, a small but statistically reliable difference. The median monetary awards were two million dollars for the severe-harm version and one million for the milder version. Similar results were obtained for several other cases.</div>
<div class="s4P">These findings highlight a key feature of the process of judgment: the subtle effect of the judgment task on the weighting of different aspects of the evidence. The participants who rated punitive intent and outrage were not aware that they were taking a stand on the philosophical issue of whether justice should be retributive. They were not even aware of assigning weights to the various features of the case. Nevertheless, they assigned a near-zero weight to harm when rating outrage and a significant weight to the same factor when determining punishment. Recall that the participants saw only one version of the story; their assignment of a higher punishment to the worse harm was not an explicit comparison. It was the outcome of an automatic operation of matching in the two conditions. The responses of participants relied more on fast than on slow thinking.</div>
<div class="s7D">Noisy Scales</div>
<div class="s4M">The second goal of the study was to find out why punitive damages are noisy. Our hypothesis was that jurors generally agree on how severely they wish the defendant to be punished but differ widely in how they translate their punitive intent onto the scale of dollars.</div>
<div class="s4P">The design of the study allows us to compare the amount of noise in judgments of the same cases on three scales: outrage, punitive intent, and damage awards in dollars. To measure noise, we apply the method that was used to analyze the results of the noise audit of federal judges in <a href="part0014.xhtml">chapter 6</a>
. We assume, as we did in that analysis, that the average of individual judgments of a case can be treated as an unbiased, just value. (This is an assumption for purposes of analysis; we emphasize that it might be wrong.) In an ideal world, all jurors who use a particular scale would agree in their judgments of every case. Any deviation from the average judgment counts as an error, and these errors are the source of system noise.</div>
<div class="s4P">As we also noted in <a href="part0014.xhtml">chapter 6</a>
, system noise can be broken <span id="page_181"></span>
down into level noise and pattern noise. Here, level noise is the variability among jurors in how severe they are in general. Pattern noise is the variability in how a given juror responds to particular cases, relative to this juror’s own average. We can therefore break down the overall variance of judgments into three elements:</div>
<div class="s185">Variance of Judgments =</div>
<div class="s187">
<span class="s2WV-1">Variance of Just Punishments + (Level Noise)</span>
<span class="s2YT-1">2</span>
 <span class="s2WV-1">+ (Pattern Noise)</span>
<span class="s2YT-1">2</span>
</div>
<div class="s4P">This analysis, decomposing the variance of judgments into three terms, was conducted separately for the three judgments of outrage, punitive intent, and dollar award.</div>
<div class="s4P">
<a href="part0025.xhtml#a2YU">Figure 13</a>
 shows the results. The least noisy scale is punitive intent, where system noise accounts for 51% of the variance—there is about as much noise as there is justice. The outrage scale is distinctly noisier: 71% noise. And the dollar scale is by far the worst: fully 94% of the variance in judgments is noise!</div>
<div class="s4P">The differences are striking because the three scales are, in terms of their content, almost identical. We saw earlier that the just values of outrage and punitive intent were almost perfectly correlated, as implied by the outrage hypothesis. The ratings of punitive intent and the dollar awards answer precisely the same question—how severely General Assistance should be punished—in different units. How can we explain the large differences seen in <a href="part0025.xhtml#a2YU">figure 13</a>
?</div>
<div class="s4P">We can probably agree that outrage is not a very precise scale. True, there is such a thing as “completely acceptable” behavior, but if there is a limit to how angry you can get at General Assistance or at the other defendants, that limit is rather vague. What does it mean for a behavior to be “absolutely outrageous”? The lack of clarity on the upper end of the scale makes some noise inevitable.</div>
<div class="s4P">Punitive intent is more specific. “Severe punishment” is more precise than “absolutely outrageous,” because an “extremely severe punishment” is bounded by the maximum prescribed by the law. You may wish to “throw the book” at the culprit, but you may not, for instance, recommend putting the CEO of General Assistance and <span id="page_182"></span>
its entire executive team to death. (We hope.) The punitive-intent scale is less ambiguous because its upper bound is more clearly specified. As we might expect, it is also less noisy.</div>

 <span class="s2WT-0">Components of judgment variance</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="s4P">Outrage and punitive intent were both measured on similar rating scales, defined more or less clearly by verbal labels. The dollar scale belongs to a different family, which is far more problematic.</div>
<div class="s7D">Dollars and Anchors</div>
<div class="s4M">The title of our academic paper expresses its central message: “Shared Outrage and Erratic Awards: The Psychology of Punitive Damages.” There was a fair amount of agreement among our experimental jurors in their ratings of punitive intent; the ratings were mostly explained by outrage. However, the dollar measure most closely simulated the courtroom situation, and it was unacceptably noisy.</div>
<div class="s4P">The reason is not mysterious. If you actually generated a specific dollar amount of damages in the Joan Glover case, you surely experienced the feeling that your choice of a number was essentially arbitrary. The feeling of arbitrariness conveys important information: it tells you that other people will make widely different arbitrary decisions and that the judgments will be very noisy. This turns out to be a characteristic of the family of scales to which dollar <span id="page_183"></span>
awards belong.</div>
<div class="s4P">The legendary Harvard psychologist S. S. Stevens discovered the surprising fact that people share strong intuitions about the <span class="s2WT-0">ratios</span>
 of intensity of many subjective experiences and attitudes. They can adjust a light so that it appears “twice as bright” as another, and they agree that the emotional significance of a ten-month prison sentence is not nearly ten times as bad as that of a sentence of one month. Stevens called scales that draw on such intuitions <span class="s2WT-0">ratio scales.</span>
</div>
<div class="s4P">You can tell that our intuitions about money are expressed in ratios from the ease with which we understand such expressions as “Sara got a 60% raise!” or “Our rich neighbor lost half his wealth overnight.” The dollar scale of punitive damages is a ratio scale for the measurement of the intention to punish. Like other ratio scales, it has a meaningful zero (zero dollars) and is unbounded at the top.</div>
<div class="s4P">Stevens discovered that a ratio scale (like the dollar scale) can be tied down by a single intermediate anchor (the jargon term is <span class="s2WT-0">modulus</span>
). In his laboratory, he would expose observers to a light of a certain brightness, with the instruction to “call the brightness of that light 10 (or 50, or 200) and assign numbers to other brightnesses accordingly.” As expected, the numbers that observers assigned to lights of different brightness were proportional to the arbitrary anchor they were instructed to adopt. An observer who was anchored on the number 200 would make judgments that were 20 times higher than if the anchor had been 10; the standard deviation of the observer’s judgments would also be proportional to the anchor.</div>
<div class="s4P">In <a href="part0023.xhtml">chapter 13</a>
, we described an amusing example of anchoring, in which people’s willingness to pay for an object was strongly influenced by asking them first if they would pay (in dollars) the last two digits of their Social Security number. A more striking result was that the initial anchor also affected their willingness to pay for a whole list of other objects. Participants who were induced to agree to pay a large amount for a cordless trackball agreed to pay a correspondingly larger amount for a cordless keyboard. It appears that people are much more sensitive to the <span class="s2WT-0">relative</span>
 value of comparable goods than to their absolute value. The authors of the study named the persistent effect of a single anchor “coherent arbitrariness.”</div>
<div id="page_184" class="s4P">To appreciate the effect of an arbitrary anchor in the Joan Glover case, suppose that the text at the beginning of this chapter included the following information:</div>
<div class="s18X">In a similar case involving another pharmaceutical company, a little girl who was the victim suffered moderate psychological trauma (as in the mild-harm version you read earlier). The punitive damages were set at $1.5 million.</div>
<div class="s4P">Notice that the problem of setting a punishment for General Assistance has suddenly become much easier. Indeed, an amount may have come to your mind already. There is a multiplier (or ratio) of the dollar awards that corresponds to the contrast between the severe harm that was done to Joan and the mild harm suffered by the other little girl. Furthermore, the single anchor you read ($1.5 million) is sufficient to tie down the entire dollar scale of punishment. It is now easy for you to set damages for cases both more severe and milder than the two considered so far.</div>
<div class="s4P">If anchors are required to make judgments on a ratio scale, what happens when people are not given an anchor? Stevens reported the answer. In the absence of guidance from the experimenter, people are forced to make an arbitrary choice when they use the scale for the first time. From that point, they make their judgments consistently, using their first answer as an anchor.</div>
<div class="s4P">You may recognize the task you faced in setting damages for the Joan Glover case as an instance of scaling without an anchor. Like the anchorless observers in Stevens’s lab, you made an arbitrary decision about the correct punishment for General Assistance. The participants in our study of punitive damages faced the same problem: they were also compelled to make an initial arbitrary decision about the first case they saw. Unlike you, however, they did not just make one arbitrary decision: they went on to set punitive damages for nine other cases. These nine judgments were not arbitrary because they could be made consistent with the initial anchoring judgment, and therefore with one another.</div>
<div id="page_185" class="s4P">The findings of Stevens’s laboratory suggest that the anchor that individuals produce should have a large effect on the absolute values of their subsequent dollar judgments but no effect whatsoever on the relative positions of the ten cases. A large initial judgment causes all the other judgments to be proportionately large without affecting their relative size. This reasoning leads to a surprising conclusion: although they appear hopelessly noisy, dollar judgments actually reflect the judges’ punitive intentions. To discover these intentions, we need only replace the absolute dollar values with relative scores.</div>
<div class="s4P">To test this idea, we repeated the analysis of noise after replacing each dollar award by its rank among an individual’s ten judgments. The highest dollar award was scored 1, the next highest was scored 2, and so forth. This transformation of dollar awards to ranks eliminates all juror-level errors, because the 1 to 10 distribution of ranks is the same for everyone, except for occasional ties. (In case you wondered, there were multiple versions of the questionnaire because each individual judged ten of the twenty-eight scenarios. We conducted the analysis separately for each group of participants who had responded to the same ten scenarios, and we report an average.)</div>
<div class="s4P">The results were striking: the proportion of noise in the judgments dropped from 94% to 49% (<a href="part0025.xhtml#a2XJ">figure 14</a>
). Transforming the dollar awards into rankings revealed that jurors were actually in substantial agreement about the appropriate punishment in different cases. Indeed, the rankings of dollar awards were, if anything, slightly <span class="s2WT-0">less</span>
 noisy than the original ratings of punitive intent.</div>

 <span class="s2WT-0">Noise in value vs. noise in ranking</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="page_186" class="s7D">An Unfortunate Conclusion</div>
<div class="s4M">The results are consistent with the theory we have outlined: dollar awards for all cases were anchored on the arbitrary number that each juror picked for the first case they saw. The relative ranking of cases reflects attitudes with fair accuracy and is thus not very noisy, but the absolute values of the dollar awards are essentially meaningless because they depend on the arbitrary number chosen in the first case.</div>
<div class="s4P">Ironically, the case that jurors assess in real trials is the first and only one they see. American legal practice requires civil juries to set a dollar award for one case, without the benefit of any guiding anchor. The law explicitly prohibits any communication to the jury of the size of punitive awards in other cases. The assumption implicit in the law is that jurors’ sense of justice will lead them directly from a consideration of an offense to the correct punishment. This assumption is psychological nonsense—it assumes an ability that humans do not have. The institutions of justice should acknowledge the limitations of the people who administer it.</div>
<div class="s4P">The example of punitive damages is extreme; professional judgments are rarely expressed on scales that are so hopelessly ambiguous. Nonetheless, ambiguous scales are common, which means that the punitive-damages study holds two general lessons, applicable in business, education, sports, government, and elsewhere. First, the choice of a scale can make a large difference in the amount of noise in judgments, because ambiguous scales are noisy. Second, replacing absolute judgments with relative ones, when feasible, is likely to reduce noise.</div>
