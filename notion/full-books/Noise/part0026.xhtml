emember Julie, the precocious child whose college GPA you tried to guess in <a href="part0024.xhtml">chapter 14</a>
? Here is a fuller description.</div>
<div class="s11B">Julie was an only child. Her father was a successful lawyer, her mother an architect. When Julie was about three years old, her father contracted an autoimmune disease that forced him to work at home. He spent a lot of time with Julie and patiently taught her to read. She was reading fluently when she was four years old. Her dad also tried to teach her arithmetic, but she found that topic difficult. Julie was a good pupil in elementary school, but she was emotionally needy and rather unpopular. She spent much time alone and became a passionate bird-watcher after being inspired by watching birds with her favorite uncle.</div>
<div class="s11D">
<span class="class-4">Her parents divorced when she was eleven, and Julie took the divorce hard. Her grades plummeted, and she had frequent outbursts at school. In high school, she did very well in some subjects, including biology and creative writing. She surprised everyone by excelling in physics. But she neglected most of her other subjects, and she graduated from high school a B student.</span>
</div>
<div class="s154">
<span class="class-4">Not admitted to the prestigious schools</span>
 <span id="page_188" class="class-4"></span>
<span class="class-4">to which she applied, Julie eventually attended a good state school, where she majored in environmental studies. During her first two years in college, she continued a pattern of frequent emotional entanglements and smoked pot fairly regularly. In her fourth semester, however, she developed a strong wish to go to medical school and began to take her work much more seriously.</span>
</div>
<div class="s4P">What is your best guess about Julie’s graduating GPA?</div>
<div class="s7D">Problems: Hard and Easy</div>
<div class="s4M">Obviously, this problem (let’s call it Julie 2.0) has become much more difficult. All you knew about Julie 1.0 was that she could read when she was four. With only one cue, the power of matching did the work, and an intuitive estimate of her GPA came quickly to mind.</div>
<div class="s4P">Matching would still be available if you had several cues that pointed in the same general direction. For instance, when you read a description of Bill, the jazz-playing accountant, all the information you had (“unimaginative,” “strong in mathematics,” “weak in social studies”) painted a coherent, stereotypical picture. Similarly, if most of the events in the life of Julie 2.0 were consistent with a story of precociousness and superior achievement (with perhaps a few data points suggesting merely “average” performance), you would not find the task so difficult. When the evidence available paints a coherent picture, our fast, System 1 thinking has no difficulty making sense of it. Simple judgment problems like these are easily resolved, and most people agree on their solution.</div>
<div class="s4P">Not so with Julie 2.0. What makes this problem difficult is the presence of multiple, conflicting cues. There are indications of ability and motivation but also of character weaknesses and mediocre achievement. The story seems to be all over the place. It does not easily make sense, because the elements cannot be fit in a coherent interpretation. Of course, the incoherence does not make the story unrealistic or even implausible. Life is often more complex than the stories we like to tell about it.</div>
<div id="page_189" class="s4P">Multiple, conflicting cues create the ambiguity that defines difficult judgment problems. Ambiguity also explains why complex problems are noisier than simple ones. The rule is simple: if there is more than one way to see anything, people will vary in how they see it. People can pick different pieces of evidence to form the core of their narrative, so there are many possible conclusions. If you found it difficult to construct a story that makes sense of Julie 2.0, you can be quite certain that other readers will construct different stories that justify judgments other than yours. This is the variability that produces pattern noise.</div>
<div class="s4P">When do you feel confident in a judgment? Two conditions must be satisfied: the story you believe must be comprehensively coherent, and there must be no attractive alternatives. Comprehensive coherence is achieved when all the details of the chosen interpretation fit with the story and reinforce each other. Of course, you can also achieve coherence, albeit less elegantly, by ignoring or explaining away whatever does not fit. It is the same with alternative interpretations. The true expert who has “solved” a judgment problem knows not only why her explanatory story is correct; she is equally fluent in explaining why other stories are wrong. Here again, a person can gain confidence of equal strength but poorer quality by failing to consider alternatives or by actively suppressing them.</div>
<div class="s4P">The main implication of this view of confidence is that subjective confidence in one’s judgment by no means guarantees accuracy. Moreover, the suppression of alternative interpretations—a well-documented process in perception—could induce what we have called the <span class="s2WT-0">illusion of agreement</span>
 (see <a href="part0009.xhtml">chapter 2</a>
). If people cannot imagine possible alternatives to their conclusions, they will naturally assume that other observers must reach the same conclusion, too. Of course, few of us have the good fortune of being highly confident about all our judgments, and all of us have had the experience of uncertainty, perhaps as recently as your reading about Julie 2.0. We are not all highly confident all the time, but most of the time we are more confident than we should be.</div>
<div class="s7D">Pattern Noise: Stable or Transient</div>
<div id="page_190" class="s4M">We have defined a pattern error as an error in an individual’s judgment of a case that cannot be explained by the sum of the separate effects of the case and the judge. An extreme example may be the normally lenient judge who is unusually severe in sentencing a particular kind of defendant (say, people who have committed traffic offenses). Or, say, the normally cautious investor who drops his usual caution when shown the plan of an exciting start-up. Of course, most pattern errors are not extreme: we observe a moderate pattern error in the lenient judge who is less lenient than usual when dealing with recidivists, or even more lenient than usual when sentencing young women.</div>
<div class="s4P">Pattern errors arise from a combination of transient and permanent factors. The transient factors include those we have described as sources of occasion noise, such as a judge’s good mood at the relevant moment or some unfortunate recent occurrence that is currently on the judge’s mind. Other factors are more permanent—for example, an employer’s unusual enthusiasm for people who attended certain universities or a doctor’s unusual propensity to recommend hospitalization for people with pneumonia. We can write a simple equation that describes an error in a single judgment:</div>
<div class="s1A9">Pattern Error = Stable Pattern Error + Transient (Occasion) Error</div>
<div class="s4P">Because stable pattern error and transient (occasion) error are independent and uncorrelated, we can extend the equation above to analyze their variances:</div>
<div class="s1AC">
<span class="s2WV-0">(Pattern Noise)</span>
<span class="s2YT-0">2</span>
 <span class="s2WV-0">= (Stable Pattern Noise)</span>
<span class="s2YT-0">2</span>
 <span class="s2WV-0">+ (Occasion Noise)</span>
<span class="s2YT-0">2</span>
</div>
<div class="s4P">As we did for other components of error and noise, we can represent this equation graphically as a sum of squares on the sides of a right triangle (<a href="part0026.xhtml#page_191">Figure 15</a>
):</div>

 <span class="s2WT-0">Decomposing Pattern Noise</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="s4P">For a simple case of stable pattern noise, consider recruiters who predict the future performance of executives on the basis of a set of ratings. In <a href="part0018.xhtml">chapter 9</a>
 we spoke of a “model of the judge.” The model of an individual recruiter assigns a weight to each rating, which corresponds to its importance in that recruiter’s judgments. The weights vary among recruiters: leadership may count more for one recruiter, communication skills for another. Such differences produce variability in the recruiters’ ranking of candidates—an instance of what we call stable pattern noise.</div>
<div class="s4P">Personal reactions to individual cases can also produce patterns that are stable but highly specific. Consider what led you to pay more attention to some aspects of Julie’s story than to others. Some details of the case may resonate with your life experience. Perhaps something about Julie reminds you of a close relative who kept almost succeeding but ultimately failing, because of what you believe are deep character flaws that were evident since that relative’s teenage years. Conversely, Julie’s story may evoke memories of a close friend who, after a troubled adolescence, did make it to medical school and is now a successful specialist. The associations that Julie evokes in different people are idiosyncratic and unpredictable, but they are likely to be stable: if you had read Julie’s story last week, you would have been reminded of the same people and would have seen her story in the same distinctively personal light.</div>
<div class="s4P">Individual differences in the quality of judgments are another source of pattern noise. Imagine a single forecaster with crystal-ball powers that no one knows about (including herself). Her <span id="page_192"></span>
accuracy would make her deviate in many cases from the average forecast. In the absence of outcome data, these deviations would be regarded as pattern errors. When judgments are unverifiable, superior accuracy will look like pattern noise.</div>
<div class="s4P">Pattern noise also arises from systematic differences in the ability to make valid judgments about different dimensions of a case. Consider the process of selection for professional sports teams. Coaches may focus on skills in various aspects of the game, physicians on susceptibility to injuries, and psychologists on motivation and resilience. When these different specialists evaluate the same players, we can expect a considerable amount of pattern noise. Similarly, professionals in the same generalist role may be more skilled at some aspects of the judgment task than at others. In such cases, pattern noise is better described as variability in what people know than as error.</div>
<div class="s4P">When professionals make decisions on their own, variability in skills is simply noise. However, when management has the opportunity to construct teams that will reach judgments together, diversity of skills becomes a potential asset, because different professionals will cover different aspects of the judgment and complement one another. We discuss this opportunity—and what is required to capture it—in <a href="part0032.xhtml">chapter 21</a>
.</div>
<div class="s4P">In earlier chapters, we spoke of the two lotteries that face the client of an insurance company or the defendant who is assigned the judge who will try him. We can now see that the first lottery, which picks a professional from a group of colleagues, selects much more than the average level of that professional’s judgments (the level error). The lottery also selects a kaleidoscopic assemblage of values, preferences, beliefs, memories, experiences, and associations that are unique to this particular professional. Whenever you make a judgment, you carry your own baggage, too. You come with the habits of mind you formed on the job and the wisdom you gained from your mentors. You bring along the successes that built your confidence and the mistakes that you are careful not to repeat. And somewhere in your brain are the formal rules you remember, those you forgot, and those you learned that it is okay to ignore. No one is exactly like you in all these respects; your stable pattern errors are unique to you.</div>
<div class="s4P">The second lottery is the one that picks the moment when <span id="page_193"></span>
you make your judgment, the mood you are in, and other extraneous circumstances that should not affect your judgment but do. This lottery creates occasion noise. Imagine, for instance, that shortly before you read Julie’s case, you read a newspaper article about drug use on college campuses. The piece featured the story of a gifted student who was determined to go to law school and worked hard—but was unable to make up for the deficit he had accumulated while using drugs in his early years of college. Because it is fresh in your mind, this story will lead you to pay more attention to Julie’s pot-smoking habit in your assessment of her overall chances. However, you probably would not remember the article if you encountered the question about Julie in a couple of weeks (and you would obviously not have known about it if you had read the case yesterday). The effect of reading the newspaper article is transient; it is occasion noise.</div>
<div class="s4P">As this example illustrates, there is no sharp discontinuity between stable pattern noise and the unstable variant that we call occasion noise. The main difference is whether a person’s unique sensitivity to some aspects of the case is itself permanent or transient. When the triggers of pattern noise are rooted in our personal experiences and values, we can expect the pattern to be stable, a reflection of our uniqueness.</div>
<div class="s7D">The Personality Analogy</div>
<div class="s4M">The idea of uniqueness in the responses of particular people to certain features or combinations of features is not immediately intuitive. To understand it, we might consider another complex combination of features that we all know well: the personalities of people around us. In fact, the event of a judge making a judgment about a case should be seen as a special case of a broader topic that is the domain of personality research: how a person acts in a situation. There is something to be learned about judgment from the decades of intensive study of the broader topic.</div>
<div class="s4P">Psychologists have long sought to understand and measure individual differences in personality. People differ from one another in many ways; an early attempt to scan the dictionary for terms that may describe a person identified eighteen thousand words. Today, <span id="page_194"></span>
the dominant model of personality, the Big Five model, combines traits into five groupings (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, openness to experience, neuroticism), with each of the Big Five covering a range of distinguishable traits. A personality trait is understood as a predictor of actual behaviors. If someone is described as conscientious, we expect to observe some corresponding behaviors (arriving on time, keeping commitments, and so on). And if Andrew scores higher than Brad on a measure of aggressiveness, we should observe that, in most situations, Andrew behaves more aggressively than Brad does. In fact, however, the validity of broad traits for predicting specific behaviors is quite limited; a correlation of .30 (PC = 60%) would be considered high.</div>
<div class="s4P">Common sense suggests that while behavior may be driven by personality, it is also strongly affected by <span class="s2WT-0">situations.</span>
 In some situations no one is aggressive, and in other situations everyone is. When consoling a bereaved friend, neither Andrew nor Brad will act aggressively; at a football game, however, both will display some aggression. In short—and unsurprisingly—behaviors are a function of personalities <span class="s2WT-0">and</span>
 of situations.</div>
<div class="s4P">What makes people unique and endlessly interesting is that this joining of personality and situation is not a mechanical, additive function. For example, the situations that trigger more or less aggression are not the same for all people. Even if Andrew and Brad are equally aggressive on average, they do not necessarily display equal aggressiveness in every context. Perhaps Andrew is aggressive toward his peers but docile with superiors, whereas Brad’s level of aggressiveness is not sensitive to hierarchical level. Perhaps Brad is particularly prone to aggression when criticized and unusually restrained when physically threatened.</div>
<div class="s4P">These signature patterns of response to situations are likely to be fairly stable over time. They constitute much of what we consider someone’s <span class="s2WT-0">personality</span>
, although they do not lend themselves to a description by a broad trait. Andrew and Brad may share the same score on a test of aggression, but they are unique in their pattern of response to aggression triggers and contexts. Two people who share a trait level—if, for example, they are equally obstinate or equally generous—should be described by two distributions of behaviors that have the same average but not necessarily the same pattern of responses to different situations.</div>
<div id="page_195" class="s4P">You can now see the parallel between this discussion of personality and the model of judgment we have presented. Level differences between judges correspond to the differences among scores on personality traits, which represent an average of behaviors in multiple situations. Cases are analogous to situations. A person’s judgment of a particular problem is only moderately predictable from that person’s average level, just as specific behaviors are only moderately predictable from personality traits. The ranking of individuals by their judgment varies substantially from one case to another because people differ in their reaction to the features and combinations of features that they find in each case. The signature of an individual who makes judgments and decisions is a unique pattern of sensitivity to features and a correspondingly unique pattern in the judgment of cases.</div>
<div class="s4P">The uniqueness of personality is normally a cause for celebration, but this book is concerned with professional judgments, where variation is problematic and noise is error. The point of the analogy is that pattern noise in judgment is not random—even if we have little hope of explaining it and even if the individuals who make distinctive judgments could not explain them.</div>
