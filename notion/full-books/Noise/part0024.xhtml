ook at the sky. How likely is it to rain in two hours?</div>
<div class="s4P">You probably had no difficulty answering this question. The judgment you made—for example, that it is “very likely” to rain soon—was produced effortlessly. Somehow, your evaluation of the sky’s darkness was converted into a probability judgment.</div>
<div class="s4P">What you just performed is an elementary example of <span class="s2WT-0">matching.</span>
 We have described judgment as an operation that assigns a value on a scale to a subjective impression (or to an aspect of an impression). Matching is an essential part of that operation. When you answer the question “On a scale of 1 to 10, how good is your mood?” or “Please give one to five stars to your shopping experience this morning,” you are matching: your task is to find a value on the judgment scale that matches your mood or experience.</div>
<div class="s7D">Matching and Coherence</div>
<div class="s4M">You met Bill in the previous chapter, and here he is again: “Bill is thirty-three years old. He is intelligent but unimaginative, compulsive and generally lifeless. In school, he was strong in mathematics but weak in social studies and humanities.” We asked you to estimate the probability that Bill had various occupations and hobbies, and we saw that you answered this question by substituting a judgment of similarity for one of probability. You did not really ask how likely Bill was to be an accountant, but how similar he was to the stereotype of that profession. We now turn to a question we left unanswered: how you made that judgment.</div>
<div class="s4P">It is not difficult to assess the degree to which Bill’s <span id="page_166"></span>
description matches the stereotypes of professions and hobbies. Bill is clearly less similar to a typical jazz player than to an accountant, and he is even less similar to a surfer. The example illustrates the extraordinary versatility of matching, which is particularly obvious in judgments about people. There is hardly a limit to the questions you could have answered about Bill. For example, how would you feel about being stranded on a desert island with him? You probably had an immediate intuitive answer to this question on the basis of the scant information provided. Yet, we have news for you: Bill, as we know him, happens to be a hardened explorer with extraordinary survival skills. If this surprises you (and it probably does), you just experienced a failure to achieve coherence.</div>
<div class="s4P">The surprise is intense because the new information is incompatible with the image of Bill that you had constructed earlier. Now imagine that Bill’s prowess and survival skills had been included in the original description. You would have ended up with a different overall image of the man, perhaps as a person who comes alive only in the great outdoors. The overall impression of Bill would have been less coherent, and therefore more difficult to match to categories of professions or hobbies, but you would have experienced far less dissonance than you just did.</div>
<div class="s4P">Conflicting cues make it more difficult to achieve a sense of coherence and to find a judgment that is a satisfactory match. The presence of conflicting cues characterizes complex judgments, in which we expect to find a lot of noise. The Gambardi problem, where some of the indications were positive and others negative, was such a judgment. We return to complex judgments in <a href="part0026.xhtml">chapter 16</a>
. In the remainder of this chapter we focus on relatively simple judgments—especially those made on <span class="s2WT-0">intensity scales.</span>
</div>
<div class="s7D">Matching Intensities</div>
<div class="s4M">Some of the scales on which we express judgments are qualitative: professions, hobbies, and medical diagnoses are examples. They are identified by the fact that the values of the scale are not ordered: red is neither more nor less than blue.</div>
<div class="s4P">Many judgments, however, are made on quantitative intensity scales. Physical measurements of size, weight, brightness, <span id="page_167"></span>
temperature, or loudness; measures of cost or value; judgments of probability or frequency—all these are quantitative. So are judgments on more abstract scales, like confidence, strength, attractiveness, anger, fear, immorality, or the severity of punishments.</div>
<div class="s4P">The distinctive feature shared by these quantitative dimensions is that the question “Which is more?” can be answered about any pair of values on the same dimension. You can tell that a flogging is a more severe punishment than a slap on the wrist or that you like <span class="s2WT-0">Hamlet</span>
 more than you liked <span class="s2WT-0">Waiting for Godot,</span>
 just as you can tell that the sun is brighter than the moon, that an elephant weighs more than a hamster, and that the average temperature in Miami is higher than in Toronto.</div>
<div class="s4P">People have a remarkable intuitive ability to match intensities across unrelated dimensions, by mapping one intensity scale onto another. You can match the intensity of your affection for different singers to the height of buildings in your city. (If you think that Bob Dylan is especially great, for example, you might match your level of enthusiasm for him to the tallest building in your city.) You could match the current level of political discord in your country to a summer temperature in a city you know well. (If there is remarkable political harmony, you might match it to a breezy seventy-degree summer day in New York.) And if you were asked to express your appreciation of a restaurant by comparing it to the length of a novel instead of the usual 1-to-5-star rating scale, this request would strike you as quite bizarre but not at all infeasible. (Your favorite restaurant might be like <span class="s2WT-0">War and Peace</span>
.) In each case, it is—oddly—quite clear what you mean.</div>
<div class="s4P">In ordinary conversation, the range of values for a scale is a function of the context. The comment “She has been saving a lot of money” has a different meaning when you are toasting the retirement of a successful investment banker than it has when you are congratulating a teenager who has been babysitting. And the meaning of words like <span class="s2WT-0">large</span>
 and <span class="s2WT-0">small</span>
 depends entirely on a frame of reference. We can, for example, make sense of a statement like “The large mouse ran up the trunk of the small elephant.”</div>
<div class="s7D">The Bias of Matching Predictions</div>
<div id="page_168" class="s4M">The following puzzle illustrates both the power of matching and a systematic judgment error that is associated with it.</div>
<div class="s11B">Julie is a graduating student at a university. Read the following piece of information about her, then guess her GPA (on the standard scale of 0.0 to 4.0):</div>
<div class="s11D">
<span class="class-4">Julie read fluently when she was four years old.</span>
</div>
<div class="s154">
<span class="class-4">What is her GPA?</span>
</div>
<div class="s4P">If you are familiar with the grade point average system in the United States, a number came to your mind quite quickly, and it was probably close to 3.7 or 3.8. How a guess about Julie’s GPA instantly came to your mind illustrates the matching process we just described.</div>
<div class="s4P">First, you evaluated how precocious a reader Julie was. The evaluation was easy because Julie read unusually early, and that precociousness placed Julie in a category on some scale. If you had to describe the scale you used, you would probably say its highest category is something like “extraordinarily precocious,” and you would note that Julie does not quite belong in that category (some children read before they are two). Julie probably belongs in the next one, the band of “unusually but not extraordinarily precocious” children.</div>
<div class="s4P">In the second step, you matched a judgment of GPA to your evaluation of Julie. Although you were unaware of doing so, you must have been looking for a value of GPA that would also fit the label “unusual but not extraordinary.” A <span class="s2WT-0">matching prediction</span>
 came to your mind, seemingly out of nowhere, when you heard Julie’s story.</div>
<div class="s4P">Deliberately carrying out the calculations required to perform these tasks of evaluation and matching would take quite a while, but in fast, System 1 thinking, the judgment is achieved quickly and effortlessly. The story we tell here about guessing Julie’s GPA involves a complex, multistage sequence of mental events that cannot be directly observed. The specificity of the mental mechanism of matching is unusual in psychology—but the evidence <span id="page_169"></span>
for it is unusually conclusive. We can be certain from many similar experiments that the following two questions, when posed to different groups of people, will elicit exactly the same numbers:</div>
<div class="sJT"><img src="rsrc31K.jpg" alt="" class="sJS" />
 <span class="s2WT-3">What percentage of Julie’s class read at an earlier age than she did?</span>
</div>
<div class="sJW"><img src="rsrc31K.jpg" alt="" class="sJS" />
 <span class="s2WT-3">What percentage of Julie’s class has a higher GPA than she does?</span>
</div>
<div class="s4P">The first question is manageable on its own: it simply asks you to evaluate the evidence you were given about Julie. The second question, which requires a distant prediction, is certainly harder—but it is intuitively tempting to answer it by answering the first.</div>
<div class="s4P">The two questions we ask about Julie are analogous to two questions that we described as universally confusing in an earlier discussion of the illusion of validity. The first question about Julie requires you to evaluate the “intensity” of the information you have about her case. The second question asks about the intensity of a prediction. And we suspect that they are still difficult to tell apart.</div>
<div class="s4P">The intuitive prediction of Julie’s GPA is a case of the psychological mechanism that we described in <a href="part0023.xhtml">chapter 13</a>
: the substitution of an easy question for a difficult one. Your System 1 simplifies a difficult prediction question by answering a much easier one: how impressive was Julie’s achievement as a four-year-old reader? An extra step of matching is required to move directly from reading age, measured in years, to GPA, measured in points.</div>
<div class="s4P">The substitution happens, of course, only if the available information is relevant. If all you knew about Julie was that she was a fast runner or a mediocre dancer, you would have no information at all. But any fact that can be interpreted as a plausible indication of intelligence is likely to be an acceptable substitute.</div>
<div class="s4P">Substituting one question for another inevitably causes errors when the true answers to the two questions are different. Substituting reading age for GPA, though seemingly plausible, is manifestly absurd. To see why, think of events that could have happened since Julie was four years old. She could have been in a terrible accident. Her parents could have had a traumatic divorce. She could have encountered an inspiring teacher who influenced her <span id="page_170"></span>
greatly. She could have become pregnant. Any of these events and many more could have affected her work in college.</div>
<div class="s4P">The matching prediction can be justified only if reading precocity and college GPA are perfectly correlated, which is clearly not the case. On the other hand, completely ignoring the information about Julie’s reading age would also be a mistake, because her reading age does provide some relevant information. The optimal prediction must lie between these two extremes of perfect knowledge and zero knowledge.</div>
<div class="s4P">What do you know about a case when you know nothing specific about it—only the category to which it belongs? The answer to that question is what we have called the outside view of the case. If we were asked to predict Julie’s GPA but given no information about her, we would surely predict the average—perhaps 3.2. This is the outside-view prediction. The best estimate of Julie’s GPA must therefore be higher than 3.2 and lower than 3.8. The precise location of the estimate depends on the predictive value of the information: the more you trust reading age as a predictor of GPA, the higher the estimate. In Julie’s case, the information is certainly quite weak, and the most reasonable prediction will accordingly be closer to the average GPA. There is a technical but fairly easy way to correct the error of matching predictions; we detail it in appendix C.</div>
<div class="s4P">Although they lead to statistically absurd predictions, predictions that match the evidence are hard to resist. Sales managers often assume that the salesperson who was more successful than the rest of the sales team last year will continue to overperform. Senior executives sometimes meet an exceptionally talented candidate and imagine how the new hire will rise to the top of the organization. Producers routinely anticipate that the next movie of a director whose previous movie was a hit will be just as successful.</div>
<div class="s4P">These examples of matching predictions are more likely than not to end in disappointment. On the other hand, matching predictions that are made when things are at their worst are more likely than not to be overly negative. Intuitive predictions that match the evidence are too extreme, both when they are optimistic and when they are pessimistic. (The technical term for such prediction errors is that they are <span class="s2WT-0">nonregressive,</span>
 because they fail to take into account a statistical phenomenon called <span class="s2WT-0">regression to the mean.</span>
<span id="page_171"></span>
)</div>
<div class="s4P">It should be noted, however, that substitution and matching do not always govern predictions. In the language of two systems, the intuitive System 1 proposes quick associative solutions to problems as they arise, but these intuitions must be endorsed by the more reflective System 2 before they become beliefs. Matching predictions are sometimes rejected in favor of more complex responses. For example, people are more reluctant to match predictions to unfavorable than to favorable evidence. We suspect that you would hesitate to make a matching prediction of inferior college performance if Julie had been a late reader. The asymmetry between favorable and unfavorable predictions disappears when more information is available.</div>
<div class="s4P">We offer the outside view as a corrective for intuitive predictions of all kinds. In an earlier discussion of Michael Gambardi’s future prospects, for example, we recommended anchoring your judgment about Michael’s probability of success on the relevant base rate (the two-year success rate for incoming CEOs). In the case of quantitative predictions such as Julie’s GPA, taking the outside view means anchoring your prediction on the average outcome. The outside view can be neglected only in very easy problems, when the information available supports a prediction that can be made with complete confidence. When serious judgment is necessary, the outside view must be part of the solution.</div>
<div class="s7D">Noise in Matching: Limitations of Absolute Judgment</div>
<div class="s4M">Our limited ability to distinguish categories on intensity scales constrains the accuracy of the matching operation. Words such as <span class="s2WT-0">large</span>
 or <span class="s2WT-0">rich</span>
 assign the same label to a range of values on the dimension of size or wealth. This is a potentially important source of noise.</div>
<div class="s4P">The retiring investment banker surely deserves the label <span class="s2WT-0">rich,</span>
 but how rich is she? We have many adjectives to choose from: <span class="s2WT-0">well-off, affluent, comfortable, wealthy, super-rich,</span>
 and others. If you were given detailed descriptions of the wealth of some individuals and had to attach an adjective to each, how many distinct categories could you form—without resorting to detailed <span id="page_172"></span>
comparisons across cases?</div>
<div class="s4P">The number of categories that we can distinguish on an intensity scale is given in the title of an all-time classic article in psychology, published in 1956: “The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two.” Beyond this limit, people tend to start to make errors—for instance, to assign A to a higher category than B when they would in fact rate B higher than A in a head-to-head comparison.</div>
<div class="s4P">Imagine a set of lines of four different lengths of between 2 and 4 inches, each line the same amount longer than the next one. You are shown one line at a time and have to call out a number between 1 and 4, where 1 goes with the shortest line and 4 with the longest. The task is easy. Now suppose you are shown lines of five different lengths and have to repeat the task calling out numbers 1 through 5. Still easy. When will you start making errors? Around the magical number of seven lines. Surprisingly, this number depends very little on the range of line lengths: if the lines were spaced between 2 and 6 inches, rather than between 2 and 4, you would still start making mistakes beyond seven lines. Much the same result is obtained when you are presented with tones that vary in loudness, or with lights of different brightness. There is a genuine limit on people’s ability to assign distinct labels to stimuli on a dimension, and that limit is around seven labels.</div>
<div class="s4P">This limit of our discriminating power matters, because our ability to match values across intensity dimensions cannot be better than our ability to assign values on these dimensions. The matching operation is a versatile tool of fast, System 1 thinking and the core of many intuitive judgments, but it is crude.</div>
<div class="s4P">The magical number is not an absolute constraint. People can be trained to make finer distinctions by hierarchical categorization. For example, we can certainly discriminate several categories of wealth among multimillionaires, and judges can discriminate degrees of severity in multiple categories of crimes, themselves ordered in severity. For this refinement process to work, however, the categories must exist in advance and their boundaries must be clear. When assigning labels to a set of lines, you cannot decide to separate the longer lines from the shorter ones and treat them as two separate categories. Categorization is not under voluntary control when you are in the fast-thinking mode.</div>
<div class="s4P">There is a way to overcome the limited resolution of <span id="page_173"></span>
adjective scales: instead of using labels, use comparisons. Our ability to compare cases is much better than our ability to place them on a scale.</div>
<div class="s4P">Consider what you would do if instructed to use a twenty-point scale of quality to evaluate a large set of restaurants, or singers. A five-star scale would be easily manageable, but you could not possibly maintain perfect reliability with a twenty-point scale. (Joe’s Pizza is worth three stars, but is it an eleven or a twelve?) The solution to this problem is simple, if time-consuming. You would first rate the restaurants, or singers, using the five-point rating scale to sort them into five categories. You would then rank the cases within each category, which you will usually be able to do with only a few ties: you probably know whether you prefer Joe’s Pizza to Fred’s Burgers, or Taylor Swift to Bob Dylan, even if you assigned them to the same category. To keep things simple, you could now distinguish four levels within each of the five categories. You can probably discriminate levels of contempt even among the singers you most dislike.</div>
<div class="s4P">The psychology of this exercise is straightforward. Explicit comparisons between objects of judgment support much finer discriminations than do ratings of objects evaluated one at a time. Judgments of line length tell a similar story: your ability to compare the length of lines that are shown in immediate succession is much better than your ability to label lengths, and you will be even more accurate when comparing lines that are in view at the same time.</div>
<div class="s4P">The advantage of comparative judgments applies to many domains. If you have a rough idea of people’s wealth, you will do better comparing individuals in the same range than you would by labeling their wealth individually. If you grade essays, you will be more precise when you rank them from best to worst than you are when you read and grade essays one by one. Comparative or relative judgments are more sensitive than categorical or absolute ones. As these examples suggest, they are also more effortful and time-consuming.</div>
<div class="s4P">Rating objects individually on scales that are explicitly comparative retains some of the benefits of comparative judgment. In some contexts, notably in education, recommendations of candidates for acceptance or promotion often require the recommender to locate the candidate in the “top 5%” or “top 20%” <span id="page_174"></span>
of some designated population, such as “students that you have taught” or “programmers with the same level of experience.” These ratings rarely deserve to be taken at face value because there is no way to keep the recommenders accountable for using the scale properly. Accountability is possible in some contexts: when managers rate employees or when analysts assess investments, a person who assigns 90% of cases to the “top 20%” category can be identified and corrected. The use of comparative judgments is one of the remedies for noise that we will discuss in <a href="part0028.xhtml">part 5</a>
.</div>
<div class="s4P">Many tasks of judgment require matching individual cases to a category on a scale (for instance, a seven-point agreement scale) or using an ordered set of adjectives (for example, “unlikely” or “extremely unlikely” in rating the probabilities of events). This type of matching is noisy because it is crude. Individuals may differ in the interpretation of labels even when they agree on the substance of the judgment. A procedure that compels explicitly comparative judgments is likely to reduce noise. In the next chapter, we further explore how using the wrong scales can add to noise.</div>
