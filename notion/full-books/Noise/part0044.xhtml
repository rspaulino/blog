his appendix presents a generic example of a checklist to be used by a decision observer (see <a href="part0030.xhtml">chapter 19</a>
). The checklist presented here roughly follows the chronological sequence of the discussion that leads to an important decision.</div>
<div class="s4P">The suggested questions that follow each item in the checklist bring additional clarifications. Decision observers should ask themselves these questions while observing the decision process.</div>
<div class="s4P">This checklist is not intended to be used as it stands. Rather, we hope that it will serve as an inspiration and a starting point for decision observers who will design a custom bias observation checklist of their own.</div>
