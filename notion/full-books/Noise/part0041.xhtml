oise is the unwanted variability of judgments, and there is too much of it. Our central goals here have been to explain why that is so and to see what might be done about it. We have covered a great deal of material in this book, and by way of conclusion, we offer here a brisk review of the main points, as well as a broader perspective.</div>
<div class="s7D">Judgments</div>
<div class="s4M">As we use the term, <span class="s2WT-0">judgment</span>
 should not be confused with “thinking.” It is a much narrower concept: judgment is a form of measurement in which the instrument is a human mind. Like other measurements, a judgment assigns a score to an object. The score need not be a number. “Mary Johnson’s tumor is probably benign” is a judgment, as are statements like “The national economy is very unstable,” “Fred Williams would be the best person to hire as our new manager,” and “The premium to insure this risk should be $12,000.” Judgments informally integrate diverse pieces of information into an overall assessment. They are not computations, and they do not follow exact rules. A teacher uses judgment to grade an essay, but not to score a multiple-choice test.</div>
<div class="s4P">Many people earn a living by making professional judgments, and everyone is affected by such judgments in important ways. Professional <span class="s2WT-0">judges,</span>
 as we call them here, include football coaches and cardiologists, lawyers and engineers, Hollywood executives and insurance underwriters, and many more. Professional judgments have been the focus of this book, both because they have been extensively studied and because their quality has such a large <span id="page_337"></span>
impact on all of us. We believe that what we have learned applies to judgments that people make in other parts of their lives, too.</div>
<div class="s4P">Some judgments are <span class="s2WT-0">predictive,</span>
 and some predictive judgments are verifiable; we will eventually know whether they were accurate. This is generally the case for short-term forecasts of outcomes such as the effects of a medication, the course of a pandemic, or the results of an election. But many judgments, including long-term forecasts and answers to fictitious questions, are unverifiable. The quality of such judgments can be assessed only by the quality of the thought process that produces them. Furthermore, many judgments are not predictive but <span class="s2WT-0">evaluative:</span>
 the sentence set by a judge or the rank of a painting in a prize competition cannot easily be compared to an objective true value.</div>
<div class="s4P">Strikingly, however, people who make judgments behave as if a true value exists, regardless of whether it does. They think and act as if there were an invisible bull’s-eye at which to aim, one that they and others should not miss by much. The phrase <span class="s2WT-0">judgment call</span>
 implies both the possibility of disagreement and the expectation that it will be limited. Matters of judgment are characterized by an expectation of <span class="s2WT-0">bounded disagreement.</span>
 They occupy a space between matters of computation, where disagreement is not allowed, and matters of taste, where there is little expectation of agreement except in extreme cases.</div>
<div class="s7D">Errors: Bias and Noise</div>
<div class="s4M">We say that <span class="s2WT-0">bias</span>
 exists when most errors in a set of judgments are in the same direction. Bias is the <span class="s2WT-0">average error,</span>
 as, for example, when a team of shooters consistently hits below and to the left of the target; when executives are too optimistic about sales, year after year; or when a company keeps reinvesting money in failing projects that it should write off.</div>
<div class="s4P">Eliminating bias from a set of judgments will not eliminate all error. The errors that remain when bias is removed are not shared. They are the unwanted divergence of judgments, the unreliability of the measuring instrument we apply to reality. They are <span class="s2WT-0">noise.</span>
 Noise is variability in judgments that should be identical. We use the term <span class="s2WT-0">system noise</span>
 for the noise observed in organizations that employ <span id="page_338"></span>
interchangeable professionals to make decisions, such as physicians in an emergency room, judges imposing criminal penalties, and underwriters in an insurance company. Much of this book has been concerned with system noise.</div>
<div class="s7D">Measuring Bias and Noise</div>
<div class="s4M">The <span class="s2WT-0">mean of squared errors (MSE)</span>
 has been the standard of accuracy in scientific measurement for two hundred years. The main features of MSE are that it yields the sample mean as an unbiased estimate of the population mean, treats positive and negative errors equally, and disproportionately penalizes large errors. MSE does not reflect the real costs of judgment errors, which are often asymmetric. However, professional decisions always require accurate predictions. For a city facing a hurricane, the costs of under- and overestimating the threat are clearly not the same, but you would not want these costs to influence the meteorologists’ forecast of the storm’s speed and trajectory. MSE is the appropriate standard for making such predictive judgments, where objective accuracy is the goal.</div>
<div class="s4P">As measured by MSE, bias and noise are independent and additive sources of error. Obviously, bias is always bad and reducing it always improves accuracy. Less intuitive is the fact that noise is equally bad and that reducing noise is always an improvement. The best amount of scatter is zero, even when the judgments are clearly biased. The goal, of course, is to minimize both bias and noise.</div>
<div class="s4P">Bias in a set of verifiable judgments is defined by the difference between the average judgment of a case and the corresponding true value. This comparison is impossible for unverifiable judgments. For example, the true value of a premium that an underwriter sets for a particular risk will never be known. Nor can we easily know the true value of the just sentence for a particular crime. Lacking that knowledge, a frequent and convenient (though not always correct) assumption is that judgments are unbiased and that the average of many judges is the best estimate of the true value.</div>
<div class="s4P">Noise in a system can be assessed by a <span class="s2WT-0">noise audit,</span>
 an experiment in which several professionals make independent <span id="page_339"></span>
judgments of the same cases (real or fictitious). We can measure noise without knowing a true value, just as we can see, from the back of the target, the scatter of a set of shots. Noise audits can measure the variability of judgments in many systems, including a radiology department and the system of criminal justice. They may sometimes call attention to deficiencies in skill or training. And they will quantify system noise—for instance, when underwriters in the same team differ in their assessments of risks.</div>
<div class="s4P">Of bias and noise, which is the larger problem? It depends on the situation. The answer might well turn out to be noise. Bias and noise make equal contributions to overall error (MSE) when the mean of errors (the bias) is equal to the standard deviations of errors (the noise). When the distribution of judgments is normal (the standard bell-shaped curve), the effects of bias and noise are equal when 84% of judgments are above (or below) the true value. This is a substantial bias, which will often be detectable in a professional context. When the bias is smaller than one standard deviation, noise is the bigger source of overall error.</div>
<div class="s7D">Noise Is a Problem</div>
<div class="s4M">Variability as such is unproblematic in some judgments, even welcome. Diversity of opinions is essential for generating ideas and options. Contrarian thinking is essential to innovation. A plurality of opinions among movie critics is a feature, not a bug. Disagreements among traders make markets. Strategy differences among competing start-ups enable markets to select the fittest. In what we call matters of judgment, however, system noise is always a problem. If two doctors give you different diagnoses, at least one of them is wrong.</div>
<div class="s4P">The surprises that motivated this book are the sheer magnitude of system noise and the amount of damage that it does. Both of these far exceed common expectations. We have given examples from many fields, including business, medicine, criminal justice, fingerprint analysis, forecasting, personnel ratings, and politics. Hence our conclusion: wherever there is judgment, there is noise, and more of it than you think.</div>
<div class="s4P">The large role of noise in error contradicts a commonly held belief that random errors do not matter, because they “cancel out.” <span id="page_340"></span>
This belief is wrong. If multiple shots are scattered around the target, it is unhelpful to say that, on average, they hit the bull’s-eye. If one candidate for a job gets a higher rating than she deserves and another gets a lower one, the wrong person may be hired. If one insurance policy is overpriced and another is underpriced, both errors are costly to the insurance company; one makes it lose business, the other makes it lose money.</div>
<div class="s4P">In short, we can be sure that there is error if judgments vary for no good reason. Noise is detrimental even when judgments are not verifiable and error cannot be measured. It is unfair for similarly situated people to be treated differently, and a system in which professional judgments are seen as inconsistent loses credibility.</div>
<div class="s7D">Types of Noise</div>
<div class="s4M">System noise can be broken down into <span class="s2WT-0">level noise</span>
 and <span class="s2WT-0">pattern noise.</span>
 Some judges are generally more severe than others, and others are more lenient; some forecasters are generally bullish and others bearish about market prospects; some doctors prescribe more antibiotics than others do. <span class="s2WT-0">Level noise</span>
 is the variability of the average judgments made by different individuals. The ambiguity of judgment scales is one of the sources of level noise. Words such as <span class="s2WT-0">likely</span>
 or numbers (e.g., “4 on a scale of 0 to 6”) mean different things to different people. Level noise is an important source of error in judgment systems and an important target for interventions aimed at noise reduction.</div>
<div class="s4P">System noise includes another, generally larger component. Regardless of the average level of their judgments, two judges may differ in their views of which crimes deserve the harsher sentences. Their sentencing decisions will produce a different <span class="s2WT-0">ranking</span>
 of cases. We call this variability <span class="s2WT-0">pattern noise</span>
 (the technical term is <span class="s2WT-0">statistical interaction</span>
).</div>
<div class="s4P">The main source of pattern noise is stable: it is the difference in the personal, idiosyncratic responses of judges to the same case. Some of these differences reflect principles or values that the individuals follow, whether consciously or not. For example, one judge might be especially severe with shoplifters and unusually lenient with traffic offenders; another might show the opposite <span id="page_341"></span>
pattern. Some of the underlying principles or values may be quite complex, and the judge may be unaware of them. For example, a judge could be relatively lenient toward older shoplifters without realizing it. Finally, a highly personal reaction to a particular case could also be stable. A defendant who resembles the judge’s daughter might well have evoked the same feeling of sympathy, and hence leniency, on another day.</div>
<div class="s4P">This <span class="s2WT-0">stable pattern noise</span>
 reflects the uniqueness of judges: their response to cases is as individual as their personality. The subtle differences among people are often enjoyable and interesting, but the differences become problematic when professionals operate within a system that assumes consistency.</div>
<div class="s4P">In the studies we have examined, the stable pattern noise that such individual differences produce is generally the single largest source of system noise.</div>
<div class="s4P">Still, judges’ distinctive attitudes to particular cases are not perfectly stable. Pattern noise also has a transient component, called <span class="s2WT-0">occasion noise.</span>
 We detect this kind of noise if a radiologist assigns different diagnoses to the same image on different days or if a fingerprint examiner identifies two prints as a match on one occasion but not on another. As these examples illustrate, occasion noise is most easily measured when the judge does not recognize the case as one seen before. Another way to demonstrate occasion noise is to show the effect of an irrelevant feature of the context on judgments, such as when judges are more lenient after their favorite football team won, or when doctors prescribe more opioids in the afternoon.</div>
<div class="s7D">The Psychology of Judgment and Noise</div>
<div class="s4M">The judges’ cognitive flaws are not the only cause of errors in predictive judgments. <span class="s2WT-0">Objective ignorance</span>
 often plays a larger role. Some facts are actually unknowable—how many grandchildren a baby born yesterday will have seventy years from now, or the number of a winning lottery ticket in a drawing to be held next year. Others are perhaps knowable but are not known to the judge. People’s exaggerated confidence in their predictive judgment underestimates their objective ignorance as well as their biases.</div>
<div id="page_342" class="s4P">There is a limit to the accuracy of our predictions, and this limit is often quite low. Nevertheless, we are generally comfortable with our judgments. What gives us this satisfying confidence is an <span class="s2WT-0">internal signal,</span>
 a self-generated reward for fitting the facts and the judgment into a coherent story. Our subjective confidence in our judgments is not necessarily related to their objective accuracy.</div>
<div class="s4P">Most people are surprised to hear that the accuracy of their predictive judgments is not only low but also inferior to that of formulas. Even simple linear models built on limited data, or simple rules that can be sketched on the back of an envelope, consistently outperform human judges. The critical advantage of rules and models is that they are noise-free. As we subjectively experience it, judgment is a subtle and complex process; we have no indication that the subtlety may be mostly noise. It is difficult for us to imagine that mindless adherence to simple rules will often achieve higher accuracy than we can—but this is by now a well-established fact.</div>
<div class="s4P">
<span class="s2WT-0">Psychological biases</span>
 are, of course, a source of systematic error, or statistical bias. Less obviously, they are also a source of noise. When biases are not shared by all judges, when they are present to different degrees, and when their effects depend on extraneous circumstances, psychological biases produce noise. For instance, if half the managers who make hiring decisions are biased against women and half are biased in their favor, there will be no overall bias, but system noise will cause many hiring errors. Another example is the disproportionate effect of first impressions. This is a psychological bias, but that bias will produce occasion noise when the order in which the evidence is presented varies randomly.</div>
<div class="s4P">We have described the process of judgment as the informal integration of a set of cues to produce a judgment on a scale. The elimination of system noise would therefore require judges to maintain uniformity in their use of cues, in the weights they assign to cues, and in their use of the scale. Even leaving aside the random effects of occasion noise, these conditions are rarely met.</div>
<div class="s4P">Agreement is often fairly high in judgments on single dimensions. Different recruiters will often agree on their evaluations of which of two candidates is more charismatic or more diligent. The shared intuitive process of <span class="s2WT-0">matching</span>
 across intensity dimensions—such as when people match a high GPA to a precocious reading age—will generally produce similar judgments. The same is true of <span id="page_343"></span>
judgments based on a small number of cues that point in the same general direction.</div>
<div class="s4P">Large individual differences emerge when a judgment requires the <span class="s2WT-0">weighting of multiple, conflicting cues.</span>
 Looking at the same candidate, some recruiters will give more weight to evidence of brilliance or charisma; others will be more influenced by concerns about diligence or calm under pressure. When cues are inconsistent and do not fit a coherent story, different people will inevitably give more weight to certain cues and ignore others. Pattern noise will result.</div>
<div class="s7D">The Obscurity of Noise</div>
<div class="s4M">Noise is not a prominent problem. It is rarely discussed, and it is certainly less salient than bias. You probably had not given it much thought. Given its importance, the obscurity of noise is an interesting phenomenon in and of itself.</div>
<div class="s4P">Cognitive biases and other emotional or motivated distortions of thinking are often used as explanations for poor judgments. Analysts invoke overconfidence, anchoring, loss aversion, availability bias, and other biases to explain decisions that turned out badly. Such bias-based explanations are satisfying, because the human mind craves causal explanations. Whenever something goes wrong, we look for a cause—and often find it. In many cases, the cause will appear to be a bias.</div>
<div class="s4P">Bias has a kind of explanatory charisma, which noise lacks. If we try to explain, in hindsight, why a particular decision was wrong, we will easily find bias and never find noise. Only a <span class="s2WT-0">statistical view</span>
 of the world enables us to see noise, but that view does not come naturally—we prefer causal stories. The absence of statistical thinking from our intuitions is one reason that noise receives so much less attention than bias does.</div>
<div class="s4P">Another reason is that professionals seldom see a need to confront noise in their own judgments and in those of their colleagues. After a period of training, professionals often make judgments on their own. Fingerprint experts, experienced underwriters, and veteran patent officers rarely take time to imagine how colleagues might disagree with them—and they spend even less <span id="page_344"></span>
time imagining how they might disagree with themselves.</div>
<div class="s4P">Most of the time, professionals have confidence in their own judgment. They expect that colleagues would agree with them, and they never find out whether they actually do. In most fields, a judgment may never be evaluated against a true value and will at most be subjected to vetting by another professional who is considered a <span class="s2WT-0">respect-expert.</span>
 Only occasionally will professionals be faced with a surprising disagreement, and when that happens, they will generally find reasons to view it as an isolated case. The routines of organizations also tend to ignore or suppress evidence of divergence among experts in their midst. This is understandable; from an organizational perspective, noise is an embarrassment.</div>
<div class="s7D">How to Reduce Noise (and Bias, Too)</div>
<div class="s4M">There is reason to believe that some people make better judgments than others do. Task-specific skill, intelligence, and a certain cognitive style—best described as being <span class="s2WT-0">actively open-minded</span>
—characterize the best judges. Unsurprisingly, good judges will make few egregious mistakes. Given the multiple sources of individual differences, however, we should not expect even the best judges to be in perfect agreement on complex judgment problems. The infinite variety of backgrounds, personalities, and experiences that make each of us unique is also what makes noise inevitable.</div>
<div class="s4P">One strategy for error reduction is debiasing. Typically, people attempt to remove bias from their judgments either by correcting judgments after the fact or by taming biases before they affect judgments. We propose a third option, which is particularly applicable to decisions made in a group setting: detect biases in real time, by designating a <span class="s2WT-0">decision observer</span>
 to identify signs of bias (see appendix B).</div>
<div class="s4P">Our main suggestion for reducing noise in judgment is <span class="s2WT-0">decision hygiene.</span>
 We chose this term because noise reduction, like health hygiene, is prevention against an unidentified enemy. Handwashing, for example, prevents unknown pathogens from entering our bodies. In the same way, decision hygiene will prevent errors without knowing what they are. Decision hygiene is as unglamorous as its name and certainly less exciting than a <span id="page_345"></span>
victorious fight against predictable biases. There may be no glory in preventing an unidentified harm, but it is very much worth doing.</div>
<div class="s4P">A noise-reduction effort in an organization should always begin with a noise audit (see appendix A). An important function of the audit is to obtain a commitment of the organization to take noise seriously. An essential benefit is the assessment of separate types of noise.</div>
<div class="s4P">We described the successes and limitations of noise reduction efforts in various domains. We now recapitulate six principles that define decision hygiene, describe how they address the psychological mechanisms that cause noise, and show how they relate to the specific decision hygiene techniques we have discussed</div>
<div class="s4P">
<span class="s2WU">The goal of judgment is accuracy, not individual expression.</span>
 This statement is our candidate for the first principle of decision hygiene in judgment. It reflects the narrow, specific way we have defined judgment in this book. We have shown that stable pattern noise is a large component of system noise and that it is a direct consequence of individual differences, of judgment personalities that lead different people to form different views of the same problem. This observation leads to a conclusion that will be as unpopular as it is inescapable: judgment is not the place to express your individuality.</div>
<div class="s4P">To be clear, personal values, individuality, and creativity are needed, even essential, in many phases of thinking and decision making, including the choice of goals, the formulation of novel ways to approach a problem, and the generation of options. But when it comes to making a judgment about these options, expressions of individuality are a source of noise. When the goal is accuracy and you expect others to agree with you, you should also consider what other competent judges would think if they were in your place.</div>
<div class="s4P">A radical application of this principle is the replacement of judgment with rules or algorithms. Algorithmic evaluation is guaranteed to eliminate noise—indeed, it is the only approach that can eliminate noise completely. Algorithms are already in use in many important domains, and their role is increasing. But it is unlikely that algorithms will replace human judgment in the final stage of important decisions—and we consider this good news. However, judgment can be improved, by both the appropriate use of algorithms and the adoption of approaches that make decisions less <span id="page_346"></span>
dependent on the idiosyncrasies of one professional. We have seen, for instance, how decision guidelines can help constrain the discretion of judges or promote homogeneity in the diagnoses of physicians and thus reduce noise and improve decisions.</div>
<div class="s4P">
<span class="s2WU">Think statistically, and take the outside view of the case</span>
<span class="s2WV-0">.</span>
 We say that a judge takes the outside view of a case when she considers it as a member of a reference class of similar cases rather than as a unique problem. This approach diverges from the default mode of thinking, which focuses firmly on the case at hand and embeds it in a causal story. When people apply their unique experiences to form a unique view of the case, the result is pattern noise. The outside view is a remedy for this problem: professionals who share the same reference class will be less noisy. In addition, the outside view often yields valuable insights.</div>
<div class="s4P">The outside-view principle favors the anchoring of predictions in the statistics of similar cases. It also leads to the recommendation that predictions should be moderate (the technical term is <span class="s2WT-0">regressive;</span>
 see appendix C). Attention to the wide range of past outcomes and to their limited predictability should help decision makers calibrate their confidence in their judgments. People cannot be faulted for failing to predict the unpredictable, but they can be blamed for a lack of predictive humility.</div>
<div class="s4P">
<span class="s2WU">Structure judgments into several independent tasks.</span>
 This divide-and-conquer principle is made necessary by the psychological mechanism we have described as <span class="s2WT-0">excessive coherence,</span>
 which causes people to distort or ignore information that does not fit a preexisting or emerging story. Overall accuracy suffers when impressions of distinct aspects of a case contaminate each other. For an analogy, think of what happens to the evidentiary value of a set of witnesses when they are allowed to communicate.</div>
<div class="s4P">People can reduce excessive coherence by breaking down the judgment problem into a series of smaller tasks. This technique is analogous to the practice of structured interviews, in which interviewers evaluate one trait at a time and score it before moving to the next one. The principle of structuring inspires diagnostic guidelines, such as the Apgar score. It is also at the heart of the approach we have called the <span class="s2WT-0">mediating assessments protocol.</span>
 This protocol breaks down a complex judgment into multiple fact-based assessments and aims to ensure that each one is evaluated <span id="page_347"></span>
independently of the others. Whenever possible, independence is protected by assigning assessments to different teams and minimizing communication among them.</div>
<div class="s4P">
<span class="s2WU">Resist premature intuitions</span>
<span class="s2WT-0">.</span>
 We have described the internal signal of judgment completion that gives decision makers confidence in their judgment. The unwillingness of decision makers to give up this rewarding signal is a key reason for the resistance to the use of guidelines and algorithms and other rules that tie their hands. Decision makers clearly need to be comfortable with their eventual choice and to attain the rewarding sense of intuitive confidence. But they should not grant themselves this reward prematurely. An intuitive choice that is informed by a balanced and careful consideration of the evidence is far superior to a snap judgment. Intuition need not be banned, but it should be informed, disciplined, and delayed.</div>
<div class="s4P">This principle inspires our recommendation to <span class="s2WT-0">sequence the information:</span>
 professionals who make judgments should not be given information that they don’t need and that could bias them, even if that information is accurate. In forensic science, for example, it is good practice to keep examiners unaware of other information about a suspect. Control of discussion agendas, a key element of the mediating assessments protocol, also belongs here. An efficient agenda will ensure that different aspects of the problem are considered separately and that the formation of a holistic judgment is delayed until the profile of assessments is complete.</div>
<div class="s4P">
<span class="s2WU">Obtain independent judgments from multiple judges, then consider aggregating those judgments.</span>
 The requirement of independence is routinely violated in the procedures of organizations, notably in meetings in which participants’ opinions are shaped by those of others. Because of cascade effects and group polarization, group discussions often increase noise. The simple procedure of collecting participants’ judgments <span class="s2WT-0">before</span>
 the discussion both reveals the extent of noise and facilitates a constructive resolution of differences.</div>
<div class="s4P">Averaging independent judgments is guaranteed to reduce system noise (but not bias). A single judgment is a sample of one, drawn from the population of all possible judgments; and increasing sample size improves the precision of estimates. The advantage of averaging is further enhanced when judges have diverse skills and complementary <span id="page_348"></span>
judgment patterns. The average of a noisy group may end up being more accurate than a unanimous judgment.</div>
<div class="s4P">
<span class="s2WU">Favor relative judgments and relative scales.</span>
 Relative judgments are less noisy than absolute ones, because our ability to categorize objects on a scale is limited, while our ability to make pairwise comparisons is much better. Judgment scales that call for comparisons will be less noisy than scales that require absolute judgments. For example, a <span class="s2WT-0">case scale</span>
 requires judges to locate a case on a scale that is defined by instances familiar to everyone.</div>
<div class="s7X-1"><img src="rsrc31A.jpg" alt="" class="s7X-0" />
</div>
<div class="s7Z">The decision hygiene principles we have just listed are applicable not only to recurrent judgments but also to one-off major decisions, or what we call <span class="s2WT-0">singular decisions.</span>
 The existence of noise in singular decisions may seem counterintuitive: by definition, there is no variability to measure if you decide only once. Yet noise is there, causing errors. The noise in a team of shooters is invisible if we see only the first shooter in action, but the scatter would become apparent if we saw the other shooters. Similarly, the best way to think about singular judgments is to treat them as <span class="s2WT-0">recurrent judgments that are made only once.</span>
 That is why decision hygiene should improve them, too.</div>
<div class="s4P">Enforcing decision hygiene can be thankless. Noise is an invisible enemy, and a victory against an invisible enemy can only be an invisible victory. But like physical health hygiene, decision hygiene is vital. After a successful operation, you like to believe that it is the surgeon’s skill that saved your life—and it did, of course—but if the surgeon and all the personnel in the operating room had not washed their hands, you might be dead. There may not be much glory to be gained in hygiene, but there are results.</div>
<div class="s7D">How Much Noise?</div>
<div class="s4M">Of course, the battle against noise is not the only consideration for decision makers and organizations. Noise may be too costly to reduce: a high school could eliminate noise in grading by having five teachers read each and every paper, but that burden is hardly <span id="page_349"></span>
justified. Some noise may be inevitable in practice, a necessary side effect of a system of due process that gives each case individualized consideration, that does not treat people like cogs in a machine, and that grants decision makers a sense of agency. Some noise may even be desirable, if the variation it creates enables a system to adapt over time—as when noise reflects changing values and goals and triggers a debate that leads to change in practice or in the law.</div>
<div class="s4P">Perhaps most importantly, noise-reduction strategies may have unacceptable downsides. Many concerns about algorithms are overblown, but some are legitimate. Algorithms may produce stupid mistakes that a human would never make, and therefore lose credibility even if they also succeed in preventing many errors that humans do make. They may be biased by poor design or by training on inadequate data. Their facelessness may inspire distrust. Decision hygiene practices also have their downsides: if poorly managed, they risk bureaucratizing decisions and demoralizing professionals who feel their autonomy is being undermined.</div>
<div class="s4P">All these risks and limitations deserve full consideration. However, whether an objection to noise reduction makes sense depends on the particular noise-reduction strategy that is under discussion. An objection to aggregating judgments—perhaps on the ground that it is too costly—may not apply to the use of guidelines. To be sure, whenever the costs of noise reduction exceed its benefits, it should not be pursued. Once the cost-benefit calculation is made, it may reveal an optimal level of noise that is not zero. The problem is that in the absence of noise audits, people are unaware of how much noise there is in their judgments. When that is the case, invoking the difficulty of reducing noise is nothing but an excuse not to measure it.</div>
<div class="s4P">Bias leads to errors and unfairness. Noise does too—and yet, we do a lot less about it. Judgment error may seem more tolerable when it is random than when we attribute it to a cause; but it is no less damaging. If we want better decisions about things that matter, we should take noise reduction seriously.</div>
